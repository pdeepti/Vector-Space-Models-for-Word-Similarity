germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .
" it would be a devastating signal to give up negotiations now .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .
more german cars and phones for china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists and guests look at a new vw polo made for australia during an off-line ceremony on friday nov .
28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens had been at loggerheads over the planned export of the facility , as it remained unclear whether china might use the plant for military purposes . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china drops plan to buy german plutonium plant the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said . " aktion weisses friedensband " and its partner organizations are trying to counter these cultural beliefs and replace them with a new message : no religion requires female circumcision , and its practice goes against every person 's right to bodily integrity .
according to the united nation 's declaration on human rights , female circumcision is both a form of child abuse , as well as an infringement of a person 's basic rights . britta drabinsky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach breakthrough on eu asylum policy eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.05.2004 greens abandon german immigration talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government had hoped to attract talented foreigners .
germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .
a court in düsseldorf is trying a group of arab men on charges of membership in a terrorist organization .
the men , of jordanian , algerian and palestinian descent , are believed to have been planning attacks against jewish facilities in berlin as well as restaurants in düsseldorf frequented by the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .
a court in düsseldorf is trying a group of arab men on charges of membership in a terrorist organization .
the men , of jordanian , algerian and palestinian descent , are believed to have been planning attacks against jewish facilities in berlin as well as restaurants in düsseldorf frequented by the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history .

" as long as one downgrades universities , you ca n't expect that the best will stay here , " peter gaehtgens , president of the universities association -lrb- hrk -rrb- said in berlin on monday during the annual hrk conference .
gaehtgens stressed that around 40,000 academics trained in europe were currently working in the u.s. and contributing to the unchallenged american dominance in science .
he appealed to the german government to raise funds for universities as well as give them more autonomy .
german chancellor schröder said that the creation of better conditions for teaching and research at universities was a " national responsibility . "
schröder added he planned to cut subsidies for home-owners , which would free up at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- yearly for education .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .
a court in düsseldorf is trying a group of arab men on charges of membership in a terrorist organization .
the men , of jordanian , algerian and palestinian descent , are believed to have been planning attacks against jewish facilities in berlin as well as restaurants in düsseldorf frequented by the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a day of infamy in spain after a series of explosions in madrid killed close to 200 people and wounded more than 1,400 , spanish officials are still uncertain who is behind the worst terrorist attack in the country 's history .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens had been at loggerheads over the planned export of the facility , as it remained unclear whether china might use the plant for military purposes . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china drops plan to buy german plutonium plant the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .

according to bavarian police , the reason for the increase can be traced to banks which , due to cost reasons , opt not to have the germany 's central bank check euro notes for their authenticity before stocking bank machines with them .
while banks are not required to have the bundesbank check all bills , if they are found to have put counterfeit money into circulation due to carelessness , they can be fined up to € 100,000 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said . " aktion weisses friedensband " and its partner organizations are trying to counter these cultural beliefs and replace them with a new message : no religion requires female circumcision , and its practice goes against every person 's right to bodily integrity .
according to the united nation 's declaration on human rights , female circumcision is both a form of child abuse , as well as an infringement of a person 's basic rights . britta drabinsky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach breakthrough on eu asylum policy eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .

the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .

a second wave of immigrants arrived during the mid-1980s , mostly refugees from the middle east , somalia and sri lanka .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens had been at loggerheads over the planned export of the facility , as it remained unclear whether china might use the plant for military purposes . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china drops plan to buy german plutonium plant the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .

but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens had been at loggerheads over the planned export of the facility , as it remained unclear whether china might use the plant for military purposes . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china drops plan to buy german plutonium plant the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens had been at loggerheads over the planned export of the facility , as it remained unclear whether china might use the plant for military purposes . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china drops plan to buy german plutonium plant the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend .

officials in north rhine-westphalia confirmed 26 cases there over the past two years .
according to bavarian police , the reason for the increase can be traced to banks which , due to cost reasons , opt not to have the germany 's central bank check euro notes for their authenticity before stocking bank machines with them .
while banks are not required to have the bundesbank check all bills , if they are found to have put counterfeit money into circulation due to carelessness , they can be fined up to € 100,000 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.05.2004 female circumcision threatens girls in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educational campaigns in africa aim to end the practice .
female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .
a court in düsseldorf is trying a group of arab men on charges of membership in a terrorist organization .

" as long as one downgrades universities , you ca n't expect that the best will stay here , " peter gaehtgens , president of the universities association -lrb- hrk -rrb- said in berlin on monday during the annual hrk conference .

he appealed to the german government to raise funds for universities as well as give them more autonomy .
german chancellor schröder said that the creation of better conditions for teaching and research at universities was a " national responsibility . "
schröder added he planned to cut subsidies for home-owners , which would free up at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- yearly for education .
he added that the german government had raised its budget for education and research by more than a third since 1998 . more briefs 04.05.2004 -pipe- deportation of foreign terror suspects problematic 03.05.2004 -pipe- greens abandon talks on immigration law 03.05.2004 -pipe- frankfurt most dangerous city in 2003 03.05.2004 -pipe- german tourism on road to recovery 01.05.2004 -pipe- germany confirms death of security officer in iraq 01.05.2004 -pipe- former german leader urges europeans to overcome fears 01.05.2004 -pipe- police and youth clash in berlin amid may day rallies 30.04.2004 -pipe- court offers hope to german army radiation victims 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .
a court in düsseldorf is trying a group of arab men on charges of membership in a terrorist organization .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .

motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

officials in north rhine-westphalia confirmed 26 cases there over the past two years .
according to bavarian police , the reason for the increase can be traced to banks which , due to cost reasons , opt not to have the germany 's central bank check euro notes for their authenticity before stocking bank machines with them .
while banks are not required to have the bundesbank check all bills , if they are found to have put counterfeit money into circulation due to carelessness , they can be fined up to € 100,000 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said . " aktion weisses friedensband " and its partner organizations are trying to counter these cultural beliefs and replace them with a new message : no religion requires female circumcision , and its practice goes against every person 's right to bodily integrity .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.05.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc insurer gerling reaches century mark gerling , one of europe 's largest insurance groups , is celebrating its 100th anniversary on tuesday .
on may 4 , 1904 , 25-year-old robert gerling founded an insurance agency in the city of cologne where he became one of the most successful agents in the region by passing on rebates from insurers on to his clients .
in 1909 he established his own insurance firm that he christened rhine fire insurance inc. and expanded his service to include direct and reinsurance .
his empire continued to grow and was given a powerful boost when giants such as the krupp company and bayer chose gerling as their primary insurance provider .
robert gerling died in 1935 .
at the beginning of the 1960s , gerling was germany 's second largest insurance company and in the 1980s , had some 8,000 employees and more than two million customers .
at the end of the 1990s , however , gerling stumbled badly , emerging from the crisis in 2003 only after selling its reinsurance and credit insurance arms .
today , gerling has revenues of € 4,4 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- and about 7,200 employees overall .
the group is represented in 20 countries . more briefs 03.05.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler to scale back ties with hyundai 03.05.2004 -pipe- siemens seals groundbreaking patent deal with microsoft 02.05.2004 -pipe- german media groups plan to merge printing operations 02.05.2004 -pipe- siemens to sell mobile phones in china 30.04.2004 -pipe- minister urges new eu members to raise taxes 30.04.2004 -pipe- government slashes economic growth forecast 30.04.2004 -pipe- weber appointed bundesbank president 29.04.2004 -pipe- german tax revenue to fall short for next two years radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens had been at loggerheads over the planned export of the facility , as it remained unclear whether china might use the plant for military purposes . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china drops plan to buy german plutonium plant the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .

emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .

on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .

the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said . " aktion weisses friedensband " and its partner organizations are trying to counter these cultural beliefs and replace them with a new message : no religion requires female circumcision , and its practice goes against every person 's right to bodily integrity .
according to the united nation 's declaration on human rights , female circumcision is both a form of child abuse , as well as an infringement of a person 's basic rights . britta drabinsky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach breakthrough on eu asylum policy eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said . " aktion weisses friedensband " and its partner organizations are trying to counter these cultural beliefs and replace them with a new message : no religion requires female circumcision , and its practice goes against every person 's right to bodily integrity .
according to the united nation 's declaration on human rights , female circumcision is both a form of child abuse , as well as an infringement of a person 's basic rights . britta drabinsky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach breakthrough on eu asylum policy eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.05.2004 greens abandon german immigration talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government had hoped to attract talented foreigners .
germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .

motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?
whatever the reason , top officials at german soccer club bayern munich are furious about rival werder bremen 's 6-0 victory over hamburg this weekend .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .

" as long as one downgrades universities , you ca n't expect that the best will stay here , " peter gaehtgens , president of the universities association -lrb- hrk -rrb- said in berlin on monday during the annual hrk conference .
gaehtgens stressed that around 40,000 academics trained in europe were currently working in the u.s. and contributing to the unchallenged american dominance in science .
he appealed to the german government to raise funds for universities as well as give them more autonomy .
german chancellor schröder said that the creation of better conditions for teaching and research at universities was a " national responsibility . "
schröder added he planned to cut subsidies for home-owners , which would free up at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- yearly for education .
he added that the german government had raised its budget for education and research by more than a third since 1998 . more briefs 04.05.2004 -pipe- deportation of foreign terror suspects problematic 03.05.2004 -pipe- greens abandon talks on immigration law 03.05.2004 -pipe- frankfurt most dangerous city in 2003 03.05.2004 -pipe- german tourism on road to recovery 01.05.2004 -pipe- germany confirms death of security officer in iraq 01.05.2004 -pipe- former german leader urges europeans to overcome fears 01.05.2004 -pipe- police and youth clash in berlin amid may day rallies 30.04.2004 -pipe- court offers hope to german army radiation victims radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the map was presented so that all that was left of the eu 's most north-easterly member state was just an unnamed blip .
the finns , however , did not take too kindly to having nine years of eu membership simply brushed out and were quick off the mark to put things right . the austrian press agency -lrb- apa -rrb- , reported that the finnish embassy in berlin wrote to the press ministry to remind them that they have been members of the eu since 1995 and would like a correction .
the map appeared last week in a number of germany 's big newspapers .
the text accompanying it gave reasons why the eu was enlarging - one of them being " a greater degree of cultural and intellectual diversity " . according to the apa , a spokesperson said that the mistake happened for purely technical reasons .
as it turned out , much of northern sweden and the atlantic islands owned by spain and portugal had also gone missing .

according to newswire efe , the new economic affairs commissioner , joaquín almunia , will propose next wednesday -lrb- 12 may -rrb- that disciplinary procedures be initiated .
the move is likely to be seen as a message that the new member states should move toward convergence with the euro zone 's rules without delay .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .

" as long as one downgrades universities , you ca n't expect that the best will stay here , " peter gaehtgens , president of the universities association -lrb- hrk -rrb- said in berlin on monday during the annual hrk conference .
gaehtgens stressed that around 40,000 academics trained in europe were currently working in the u.s. and contributing to the unchallenged american dominance in science .
he appealed to the german government to raise funds for universities as well as give them more autonomy .
german chancellor schröder said that the creation of better conditions for teaching and research at universities was a " national responsibility . "
schröder added he planned to cut subsidies for home-owners , which would free up at least € 5 billion -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- yearly for education .
he added that the german government had raised its budget for education and research by more than a third since 1998 . more briefs 04.05.2004 -pipe- deportation of foreign terror suspects problematic 03.05.2004 -pipe- greens abandon talks on immigration law 03.05.2004 -pipe- frankfurt most dangerous city in 2003 03.05.2004 -pipe- german tourism on road to recovery 01.05.2004 -pipe- germany confirms death of security officer in iraq 01.05.2004 -pipe- former german leader urges europeans to overcome fears 01.05.2004 -pipe- police and youth clash in berlin amid may day rallies 30.04.2004 -pipe- court offers hope to german army radiation victims 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .
more german cars and phones for china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists and guests look at a new vw polo made for australia during an off-line ceremony on friday nov .
28 , 2003 at shanghai volkswagen in china .
shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .
the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens had been at loggerheads over the planned export of the facility , as it remained unclear whether china might use the plant for military purposes . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de china drops plan to buy german plutonium plant the chinese government said on tuesday that it has retracted a controversial plan to buy a defunct german plutonium plant .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said . " aktion weisses friedensband " and its partner organizations are trying to counter these cultural beliefs and replace them with a new message : no religion requires female circumcision , and its practice goes against every person 's right to bodily integrity .
according to the united nation 's declaration on human rights , female circumcision is both a form of child abuse , as well as an infringement of a person 's basic rights . britta drabinsky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers reach breakthrough on eu asylum policy eu interior ministers have acheived partial success on controversial plans to create a europe-wide asylum policy .

female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .
in germany , as many as 6,000 girls of african origin are also threatened by the gruesome ritual . germany is home to at least 24,000 women from african countries who 've undergone female circumcision , or , as many experts call it , female genital mutilation -lrb- fgm -rrb- .
that 's because the practice involves either the full or partial removal of a woman 's external genitalia , and has painful physical and psychological consequences . jeanette zachäus of the german human rights organization " aktion weisses friedensband " says the daughters of some african immigrants in germans are potential victims of fgm - about 6,000 girls . " we became aware of the problem through somalian women living here in germany , who were going to german doctors .
they said it was difficult to get treatment when their doctors did n't know much about fgm , " zachäus told deutsche welle . german doctors helpless her organization has launched a new initiative , supported by the society for german technical co-operation and women 's rights groups such as terre des femmes , to raise awareness about fgm , and put a stop to the practice .
" aktion weisses friedensband " has also started an educational campaign aimed at german doctors , to make them better able to treat women and girls who 've undergone fgm . the practice is a culturally sanctioned tradition in about 30 african countries .
but zachäus says an awareness campaign is needed in germany , because african families living here often take their four- to seven-year old daughters back to their home country to be circumcized . jawahir cumar is a somalian woman living in germany .
she was circumcized as a young girl , and now works for the organization " stop mutilation , " which mainly runs awareness programs in africa to educate people about the devastating effects fgm has on girls and women .
but she 's also active in germany . " here , we invite women who 've been affected by fgm to meet with us , so they can speak to other women .
no men are allowed to be there .
and when we work in africa , we drive from village to village and speak to parents .
we also go to schools there and show the students posters and photos of what the circumcision operation looks like . " deadly consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical tools for carrying out female genital mutilation .
the photos are shocking .
the operations are often carried out with little or no regard to hygiene .
the girls are n't given any sedatives .
their genitals are cut with dirty razor blades , knives , or shards of glass . many of the girls die from the operation , because of infection , injury , or aids .
the girls who survive often have their vaginal openings sewn closed , only to be cut open again on their wedding night . " the people who promote female circumcision sometimes give religious reasons why the operations are necessary .
and sometimes , they give health reasons , for example , that women who have n't undergone circumcision are n't able to bear children later in life , " said christa müller of " intact , " an international initiative against fgm . " another reason you hear is that uncircumcized women are n't as attractive as those who 've been circumcized .
i would say that it 's the men 's interests that play the largest role .
a man has an interest in knowing that the woman he marries is a virgin .
and she should n't be able to take too much pleasure from sex , so that she wo n't have affairs with other men . he wants a guarantee that the children she bears are from him , " müller said .

about 3 percent of the country 's 5 million residents hail from countries outside the european union , with the remaining 4 percent coming from eu member states .
many came as guest workers from turkey , pakistan and the then-yugoslavia during the 1970s and stayed on .
a second wave of immigrants arrived during the mid-1980s , mostly refugees from the middle east , somalia and sri lanka .
the country is also home to a muslim population of between 130,000 to 150,000 according to sociologist mustafa hussain , who has studied minorities in denmark .
in urban areas like copenhagen , they help to weave a diverse fabric through daily life .
but denmark has undergone a major political shift in recent years that has seen a rise in less favorable conditions for immigrants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen in 2002 , the danish government , led by prime minister anders fogh rasmussen -lrb- photo -rrb- with the support of the anti-immigration populist danish people 's party , severely tightened its immigration policies .
the new law made it more difficult for families to be reunited and extended the period of time required before immigrants can get permanent residence from three to seven years .
it also requires that foreigners demonstrate the success of their integration before obtaining the visa .
it made it difficult for foreigners to bring back a spouse they had married abroad as well as tightened restrictions on asylum applications and welfare benefits for foreigners living in the country .
the reforms have been as lightning rod for criticism from the european union .
the government began hardening its immigration policies in 1999 following tensions between danes and immigrants under growing criticism that foreigners were not sufficiently integrating and that a rise in street crime was linked to that failure , according to the u.s. state department 's annual human rights report .
the series of laws are also aimed at improving integration of foreigners .
newcomers over the age of 18 are require to begin participation in a three-year introduction program that includes courses on danish culture and language within one month of their arrival .
after nine years of legal residence , foreigners can apply to become naturalized danish citizens . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .
there are currently more than 600 chinese companies in germany .
but more direct investment of german companies in china and a sharing of technology information is also necessary , in order to build up a strong economic partnership .

shanghai volkswagen ' first made-for-export polo sedan car is destined for sale in australia .
emphasizing the importance of bilateral investment and joint ventures , wen 's first stop in germany was the southern state of bavaria , where among other things he was shown around volkswagen 's audi plant in ingolstadt .
according to the finiancial times , vw is hoping to open a large engine-producing outlet in the chinese port city of dalian .
this would be vw 's third factory in china , with plants already operating in shanghai and changchun .
so far the two plants have proved so successful that more cars roll off the assembly line in china than at vw 's headquarters in wolfsburg .
with a 30 percent share of the overall chinese car market and sales of some 700,000 cars , the german carmaker has definitely become the people 's car in china .
but volkswagen is not the only german company to do business in the chinese market .
technology giant siemens , for instance , has extensive investments in china , starting with the construction of the high-speed transrapid train linking downtown shanghai with the airport .
on tuesday the munich-based company is set expand its business when it signs a major deal with china allowing it to sell its mobile phones throughout the country and not just in the major cities as it does now .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported on sunday that several other german companies such as bayer , degussa and infineon are also expected to take advantage of wen 's visit and the political focus on strengthening economic ties between berlin and beijing to sign partnership contracts with chinese firms .
on tuesday a high-profile bilateral technology forum in berlin will serve as the backdrop for the brokering of many deals .
a bit of politics on the side between the forging of business relations , wen will also have time to meet with german chancellor gerhard schröder for political talks .
on monday evening the two are expected to address the issue of lifting the arms embargo which was imposed on china in 1989 over human rights violations during the tiananmen square massacre .
deputy chinese foreign minister yang yesui maintained last week that the lifting of the embargo was long overdue .
" i 've never really seen a justified link between the embargo and human rights issues , " he said .
" the embargo stands in the way of closer cooperation between us and the whole of the european union , and it needs to be done away with immediately . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder shakes hands with waitresses in guangzhou , southern china , tuesday , dec.2 , 2003 .
during his recent visit to china , schröder promised to push for the lifting of the embargo in brussels .
although several member states such as france advocate the removal of the restrictions , the eu as a whole has not yet finished analyzing the issue , and many say the decision has to hinge on improvements in china 's human rights records .
compounding the discussion is the fact that the united states has warned the eu about lifting the embargo .
last week eu foreign ministers said they were " a long way from making a decision , " but wen told die welt he was optimistic it would happen soon .
it 's also not clear whether a previously planned export to china of a mothballed plutonium processing plant in the central german town of hanau will be a topic of discussion for meetings between the two leaders .
bilateral negotiations on the controversial deal stalled last week , and wen jiabao said he himself would not bring up the touchy issue in berlin and would rather wait for germany to reach a decision .

wen jiabao arrives in germany on sunday for the start of an 11-day tour of europe .
the promotion of stronger business ties between beijing and berlin and the lifting of an arms embargo top the prime minister 's agenda . one day after the european union opened its doors to 10 new countries , china 's prime minister kicked off the start of a whirlwind tour of the continent with a view to promoting stronger strategic and economic partnerships with the eu .
his first stop on the 11-day visit is germany , where he is scheduled to meet with both political and business leaders over the course of three days .
in an interview with the german daily die welt ahead of his departure , wen said the focus of his first official trip to germany was " above all to promote the economy , trade and technology exchange . "
germany is china 's biggest trading partner in the eu , and china hopes to double its trade volume with germany by the year 2010 , wen stated .
in 2003 , exports from germany to china totaled 18 billion euros .
the prime minister said he believes both countries have vast opportunities to intensify their cooperation , particularly in the high-tech area and the training of skilled workers .
china , wen said , was also interested in increasing its investment in germany .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .
there is currently only one other major case underway against suspected terrorists in germany .
a court in düsseldorf is trying a group of arab men on charges of membership in a terrorist organization .

german prosecutors in berlin on tuesday started to make their case against a tunisian man accused of planning bombing attacks and seeking to create an al qaeda sleeper cell . federal prosecutors have charged the tunisian with planning to create an al qaeda cell and to conduct attacks on berlin and other german cities .
garnaoui , who has been in custody for over a year , is believed to have been trained in the use of weapons and explosives at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan during july 2001 .
later , prosecutors say , he also worked as a trainer in the camps and became personally acquainted with osama bin laden .
they say he returned to germany under a fake passport in january 2003 and began planning the cell and a round of attacks .
but police may have foiled a madrid-like tragedy through his arrest on march 20 , the first day of the war against iraq .
explosives found " he apparently already began the preparations .
he had deposited explosive materials in an apartment in gelsenkirchen and apparently sought accomplices in berlin in the al nur mosque and asked them if they would be interested in helping out with concrete plans for bomb attacks , " arnd bödeker , spokesman for the berlin court hearing the case told public broadcaster ard .
when police searched garnaoui 's apartment , they found bomb-making materials , as well as wristwatches with timers and cell phones that could be used to detonate bombs .
further searches in connection with his case uncovered aerial photographs of 170 german cities , including nuclear power plants and chemical plants .
at the berlin mosque , he reportedly won over four accomplices and several supporters for his plot .
the links between garnaoui and the al nur mosque also ensure that the case will also look into how some terrorists have used mosques to recruit and train potential terrorists .
prosecutors believe the suspect was planning an attack in conjunction with a major protest against the start of the iraq war last year , and that garnaoui wanted kill as many people as possible in an effort to humiliate the west .
" the goal of this bombing attack was or could have been , especially , american and jewish institutions , also those here in berlin , " bödecker said .
garnaoui 's trial is expected to run at least through the end of july .
trying times for german prosecutors much attention is likely to be focused on the trial in light of the difficulties german prosecutors have had in their cases against suspected terrorists in germany .
on march 4 , the federal court of justice in karlsruhe overturned the prosecution and ordered a retrial of mounir al motassadeq , the only person convicted of terrorism in germany who had ties to the cell responsible for the sept .
11 terror attacks in new york and washington .
motassadeq had been convicted of 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison .
and that was only the highest-profile case .
earlier this year , a german court also cleared another suspected terrorist , the moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , of all charges , citing a lack of evidence .
in 2003 , a trial against islam fundamentalists accused of planning a terrorist attack on the christmas market in strasbourg , france , also ended without convictions .

germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .
the move threatens to create a crisis in the governing coalition . negotiations on a new immigration law meant to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany collapsed on monday after the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , gave up hope of reaching a deal . " the game is over , " green party chief reinhard bütikofer said .
" the opposition does n't want immigration … it does n't want compromises , but rather just wants to block the issue .
further discussions do n't make sense , " co-leader of the greens , angelika beer told daily berliner zeitung .
she added the greens would meet on friday to decide whether the decision would be made official . conservatives force changes the move by the greens underlines the increasingly fraught discussions in the past six months between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens on one side and the conservative opposition christian democrats over the touchy issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners wait at hamburg 's foreign office for years , germany 's conservatives have insisted that germany " is n't an immigration country " though as many as 7.3 million foreigners live in the country today .
the country 's complex maze of immigration laws has prevented hiring foreign workers , though it has n't stopped immigrants from coming in as asylum-seekers and refugees . however , in the late 1990s the new coalition of spd and greens overhauled the citizenship law making it easier for immigrants and their children to receive german passports .
in february 2001 , chancellor schröder responded to demands from german industry and business and created a " green card " for information-technology workers .
it also started to push through a law allowing it to pick immigrants more selectively . but in the face of rising employment the conservatives began exploiting voters ' fears that outsiders would take away their jobs .
they eventually won control of the upper house , which represents germany 's federal states .
the conservatives then demanded changes to the law at the end of 2002 when the bill was reintroduced in parliament due to a procedural error . greens resist conservative pressure ever since , the government has been forced to water down several points contained in the original draft immigration legislation under pressure from the conservatives . for instance , the spd and greens scrapped a points system that would have let in highly qualified foreigners into the country without an employment contract and have renounced demands that a hiring ban on foreigners outside the european union be lifted . other stumbling blocks include refugee protection , integration of foreigners and the deportation of foreigners suspected of terrorism .
the latter in particular has been a sticking point between the parties with the greens protesting that the conservatives were laying too much emphasis on the internal security aspect - an issue , they say , has nothing to do with the immigration law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives however insist - in the aftermath of the madrid terror attacks in march - that the foreigner law in the country 's penal code should be tightened . brandenburg interior minister and cdu state chairman jörg schönbohm said on tuesday that the greens should realize there was no way past the security aspect and said the cdu was " hell-bent on preventing any danger to our population . " spd unhappy with green stance despite the differences with the opposition conservatives , green leader bütikofer indicated on monday that the government could still get its way , albeit with limits , with some aspects of the immigration package that only needed the approval of the bundestag or lower house of parliament . thus , the spd and greens could begin integration courses for foreigners that include language courses and an introduction to german history and law as well as hire skilled foreign workers for certain branches much like the green card regulation in the it sector . bütikofer also pointed out that a national immigration law would also prove to be superfluous in several areas in the future because the eu member states were striving for an eu-wide uniform asylum and migration legislation . however , schröder 's social democrats are n't pleased with the greens ' stance .
interior minister otto schily said the greens ' decision to pull out of talks was a provocation .
" if mr. bütikofer thinks he calls the shots here , then i 'm convinced it would lead to a serious crisis in the coalition . " spd politician dieter wiefelspütz said things still had n't gone as far as to suspend talks with the opposition .
" it would be a devastating signal to give up negotiations now .

german soccer team schalke 04 celebrates 100 years of existence on tuesday .
the gelsenkirchen-based club will stage centenary events all year , but the official birthday party is set for this week . on may 4 1904 , eight friends founded a soccer team in the industrial heartland of western germany .
it was not a particularly special event .
the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

the turn of the century saw an explosion in the formation of organized sports clubs across the country . but when willy gies , josef ferse , viktor kroguhl , johann kessel , heinrich kullmann , adolf ötzelmann , josef seimetz and willy van der berg got together on an uneven meadow under the name westphalia schalke , they were laying the foundations of a club that would become one of the biggest in germany . a century on and schalke 04 has changed almost beyond recognition .
gone are the original colors of red and yellow , replaced by a blue and white uniform in 1924 , the original club staff has been expanded from 16 to 250 employees and the sloping field of 1904 has been replaced by the € 185 million schalke arena , one of the world 's most advanced stadiums .
but schalke has remained gelsenkirchen 's team and has stayed true to the roots laid down 100 years ago . in the years that have passed since its foundation , schalke 04 has won the german league championship seven times , the german cup four times and has tasted european success with a uefa cup victory in 1997 .
it is this history of achievement and the hard work that went in to achieving it that is being celebrated this week as the club marks its birthday on tuesday . schlake celebrates the celebrations are set to continue for most of the year , but this week marks the real start of things .
under the title " schalke celebrates , " the royal blues and their supporters will come together on may 8 at the schalke arena for a huge fan party inside the stadium .
" we aim to show that we 're still quite sprightly , even at 100 .
it 'll be blithe , funny and off-the-wall , " said the club 's cigar-loving manager rudi assauer . the club will also be taking its celebrations on the road in its centenary year under the motto " schalke on the road " when the club 's roadshow sets off to cover some 40,000 kilometers - the equivalent of once around the world - in exactly 100 days .
there is also an open-invitation soccer tournament planned involving 80 teams at 16 locations all over germany , the first three teams from each preliminary round will battle it out for the opportunity to play for the victoria cup at the schalke arena . the obligatory centenary match is of course an integral part of the club 's plans .
" we are in the final phase of our planning , but will not announce our opponents until we have received firm confirmation , " said assauer . a musical history when the week of birthday celebrations ends this sunday , with the premiere performance of " 04 - nobody can get past god " - a musical based on the history of the club , schalke 04 will prepare to embark on the next 100 years with a new injection of cash and new players on the horizon . however , the vision stays the same as rudi assauer asserts : " i will become a german champion .
i can not look into a crystal ball but i know sometime i will have the trophy in my hands . "
with funds at his disposal , assauer is prepared to take schalke into the big league of high-spending european soccer clubs in a bid to make his and the club 's dreams come true . transfer activity already the future is beginning to take shape .
the draw of the german team has already brought werder bremen 's brazilian scoring sensation ailton to the club for the beginning of next season - no mean feat considering the potential glory awaiting the striker at his current club come the end of the season and champion 's league action at the start of the next .
on top of that , assauer has been serenading a number of europe 's most sought after stars in an attempt to build a team capable of domestic and european success . the much-fancied dutch international mark van bommel is in advanced talks with schalke about a move to gelsenkirchen from psv eindhoven despite the interest of a number of english premiership sides .
bayern munich 's claudio pizzaro is also likely to join schalke for next season while assauer has also made enquiries into the availability of liverpool 's midfielder dietmar hamann in a bid to bring the solid german international back home . there is also talk of accelerating the transfer of vfb stuttgart 's brazilian defender marcelo bordon so the player can join schlake for next season .
a deal has been agreed for bordon to join in 2005 but the brazilian has expressed a desire to move a year earlier . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern chiefs question werder bremen result in hamburg sour grapes or a case of paranoia ?

japweed is a fast growing weed with fronds that can reach eight metres long and have the potential to smother native seaweed and other marine plants .
it is the first time japweed , which is native to japan , has been found in scotland and conservationists say it is almost impossible to get rid of .
there are fears that the weed could colonise and smother commercial oyster and mussel beds .
scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- fears that japweed or wire weed -lrb- sargassum muticum -rrb- could cause " commercial and environmental damage " .
snh 's andrew bielinski said : " even the fronds when they are floating around are actually capable of reproduction , so it 's quite a vigorous species .
" we think that it could end up smothering out some of the more important seaweed species in loch ryan which make this place particularly special in a scottish context . "
it is thought the weed has been spreading around the world on the hulls of ships .
it probably got into loch ryan on the ferries from northern ireland where it turned up some time ago .
snh fears further spread up the west coast , but say they are not aware of any way to stop its spread .

very little research has been done on the condition , which can lead to cancer developing in the lower part of the oesophagus .

normally a valve at the bottom of the oesophagus prevents acids from reaching up into the gullet .
however , some people have a weak valve which allows acid to flow backwards into the oesophagus , causing the condition .
if the condition is spotted , the patient can be monitored on a regular basis .
this will allow rapid intervention if cancerous cells start to appear .
the scientists have been given the money to work on a simple tool they call a dip-stick for use in hospitals and gp practices .
a swab of fluid from the throat would be placed below a genetic marker on the dip-stick , which would then show if the disease was present or not .
they hope to have it ready for widespread clinical trials within two years .

peter clarke says the current system of catchment areas is fundamentally flawed and does not take into account the needs of some children .
he is calling for a national debate on the way local authorities decide where children go to school .
but education minister jane davidson said the current system operates fairly across wales .
the welsh assembly government said parents have the right to say which school they would like their children to go to , but if the school is oversubscribed , there is no guarantee .
eleven-year-old sophie jones from cardiff has not been to lessons since she left her primary school last july , and is now being taught at home .
if we talk to the children , we can plot a course forward that 's in the best interests of everyone .
peter clarke her friends now go to whitchurch high school in the city , but sophie lives outside the catchment area .
cardiff council said the school was oversubscribed and full , with 395 applicants for 357 places .
her mother michelle jones said the situation was unfair on sophie .
" we 've told her we 'll put her in another school , but she does n't want to go anywhere else , " she said .
" we just want someone to listen and realise she needs to be in school with her friends .
" she thinks she 's done something wrong . "
last month the conservatives said they would phase in plans to prevent schools giving admission to pupils who live closest .
the tories said it would depend on driving up standards in all schools in an area to give parents more choice under a " pupil passport " scheme .
mr clarke said local authorities did not fully comprehend the problems the current system was creating .
sophie jones says it is lonely learning on her own " i do n't think they have a full understanding of what this is going to mean for some individual children , " he said .
" that 's why i think we need in every local authority and across wales to start a dialogue .
" they must understand what it means for a child to be not able to go to the school where their friends are , where it 's easier for them to go " if we talk to the children , it will be firmly on the radar and we can plot a course forward that 's in the best interests of everyone . "
margaret morrissey of the national confederation of parent teacher associations agreed that the system needed looking at .
" it 's difficult to say ' get rid of all catchment areas ' as this may exacerbate the problem but it 's certainly a growing concern , " she said .
however , education minister jane davidson said the current system " operates fairly across wales with pupils generally going to their local school and going on to secondary school with most of their friends " .
she said she was always happy to look at ways to make the system fairer " but we need to make sure the system benefits the vast majority of children in wales " .

peter clarke says the current system of catchment areas is fundamentally flawed and does not take into account the needs of some children .
he is calling for a national debate on the way local authorities decide where children go to school .
but education minister jane davidson said the current system operates fairly across wales .
the welsh assembly government said parents have the right to say which school they would like their children to go to , but if the school is oversubscribed , there is no guarantee .
eleven-year-old sophie jones from cardiff has not been to lessons since she left her primary school last july , and is now being taught at home . "
if we talk to the children , we can plot a course forward that 's in the best interests of everyone . "
peter clarke her friends now go to whitchurch high school in the city , but sophie lives outside the catchment area .
cardiff council said the school was oversubscribed and full , with 395 applicants for 357 places .
her mother michelle jones said the situation was unfair on sophie .
" we 've told her we 'll put her in another school , but she does n't want to go anywhere else , " she said .
" we just want someone to listen and realise she needs to be in school with her friends .
" she thinks she 's done something wrong . "
last month the conservatives said they would phase in plans to prevent schools giving admission to pupils who live closest .
the tories said it would depend on driving up standards in all schools in an area to give parents more choice under a " pupil passport " scheme .
mr clarke said local authorities did not fully comprehend the problems the current system was creating .
" i do n't think they have a full understanding of what this is going to mean for some individual children , " he said .
" that 's why i think we need in every local authority and across wales to start a dialogue .
" they must understand what it means for a child to be not able to go to the school where their friends are , where it 's easier for them to go " if we talk to the children , it will be firmly on the radar and we can plot a course forward that 's in the best interests of everyone . "
margaret morrissey of the national confederation of parent teacher associations agreed that the system needed looking at .
" it 's difficult to say ' get rid of all catchment areas ' as this may exacerbate the problem but it 's certainly a growing concern , " she said .
however , education minister jane davidson said the current system " operates fairly across wales with pupils generally going to their local school and going on to secondary school with most of their friends " .
she said she was always happy to look at ways to make the system fairer " but we need to make sure the system benefits the vast majority of children in wales " .

ferry companies , the national trust and english heritage are involved in a project designed to encourage more use of the fal estuary .
one of its main features is a £ 450,000 landing stage being built for visitors to the trust 's trelissick gardens .
trelissick property manager chris curtis said the new pontoon should be in use by august .
when it is finished , visitors will be able to take a ferry from falmouth , truro and st mawes to the garden , using services provided by many of the existing ferry operators .
the project is part-funded by objective one and further financial aid is coming from cornwall environment trust ltd and carrick district council 's truro harbour authority .
mr curtis said : " the pontoon is part of a whole project to open up access to the fal because the roads around there are not that easy and some areas are inaccessible .
" coming by water is a way of giving everybody , even those who do n't own their own boat , a way of getting here and coming to visit the properties and the whole area of the fal .
water taxi " it is magic going up the creeks and admiring the view around and to experience that peace and tranquillity . "
truro harbourmaster andy brigden also welcomed the plans to open up the use of the river .
" it is refreshing to see so much more happening on the water .
" we are getting new ferry routes starting now , such as the truro to st mawes route .
" the prince of wales pier to mylor yacht harbour route is starting soon and we have already got the water taxi into its third consecutive year . "

mr gott : " we have tried to live up to the engineering ideals of royce " tony gott has a thing or two in common with the creators of the legendary rolls-royce motor car .
like the nineteenth century gentleman the honourable charles stewart rolls , mr gott seems perfectly comfortable with rubbing shoulders with the very wealthy .
like the engineering pioneer frederick henry royce he is passionate about engineering .
and like both rolls and royce , mr gott has started from scratch with the sole aim of building the world 's best motor car .
turbulent century for rolls and royce , it all began at a meeting at the midland hotel in manchester on 4 may 1904 .
the two men - one an early day car importer , the other a hobby car builder - shared an enthusiasm for motoring that was clearly going to get them places .
rolls-royce motor cars playing the heritage card on that day , the idea for an icon was conceived , and soon the two men were actively driving the motoring revolution forward , while at the same time getting deeply involved in the world of aviation .
a decade later when war broke out , the market for expensive motors vanished overnight .
rolls-royce remained active , however , by producing aircraft engines , as well as armoured cars for the military .
between the wars , rolls-royce acquired the troubled racing car maker bentley , and the company then remained in business as a firm of two divisions - aero and automotive - until 1971 when it was split into two separate companies .
badge only mr gott 's adventure started rather differently .
having spent the best parts of the 1980s and 1990s working for the rolls-royce and bentley motor company in crewe , he was appointed chief executive following a takeover by the german car group volkswagen in the autumn of 2002 .
mr gott is sitting pretty in the new rolls-royce company however , the sale of the company did not include the right to use the rolls-royce brand - apparently to the great surprise of vw .
that was owned by rolls-royce plc - the aircraft engine manufacturer which confusingly shares its name with the car maker - and had been licensed to vickers for use on cars produced at the crewe factory ever since the car and aircraft engine divisions went their separate ways .
following volkswagen 's takeover of the car maker , roll-royce plc promptly passed on the badge to its partner in an aero-engine joint venture , german car maker bmw .
the deal significantly raised the profile of bmw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
rolls-royce reborn over the next couple of years , a session of " musical executives " was acted out , with mr pischetsrieder leaving bmw to take over the top job at volkswagen , while mr gott left bentley motors and joined bmw 's rolls-royce motor cars as chief executive .
bentley is still servicing rollers made at its crewe factory mr gott 's first job was to oversee the final stages of the building of a spanking new factory at goodwood in west sussex - and then to launch the new rolls-royce .
when the £ 240,000 rolls-royce phantom was unveiled last january , many in the world of luxury cars were impressed .
and when he unveiled the company 's centenary experimental car , the 100ex convertible , at the geneva motor show in march , many in the audience were positively ecstatic .
" what they 've done at goodwood is absolutely tremendous , " bentley board member in charge of sales and marketing , adrian hallmark , told bbc news online .
" it 's a remarkable greenfield development . "
heritage but the praise from bentley is not without a somewhat acidic hint at a lack of true heritage possessed by the phantom .
the rolls-royce phantom was created from scratch after all , during the previous 64 years rolls-royce cars were produced at the current bentley factory in crewe , having moved there from manchester via derby .
" the only continuity between -lsb- the goodwood factory -rsb- and the previous years is tony gott , " said mr hallmark .
" all that bmw bought was a licence to use the name . "
bentley even continues to service rolls-royce cars made in crewe during the last few decades .
" my own feeling on this is that rolls-royce 's heritage is here , " a factory worker in crewe told bbc news online .
" nobody else can make a rolls-royce . "
engineering ideals mr gott - who obviously disagrees - remains gentlemanly aloof when faced with such talk , insisting that rolls-royce motor cars ' fresh start away from the ageing crewe factory was a help , not a hindrance .
the centenary show car caused quite a stir when it was launched by starting afresh , rolls-royce has managed to create a " modern fusion of the best craftsmanship , the best technology and the best infrastructure " without being bogged down by old practices , he said .
" we have , arguably , the strongest brand , wherever you go in the world , " he told bbc news online .
" then we have a fine product . "
even with its lofty list price of £ 240,000 - plus extras for any bespoke additions - the car has proved popular among the world 's super rich .
" we have tried to live up to the engineering ideals of royce , " said mr gott , clearly convinced that this appeals to its discerning clients .
last year , 300 cars were sold , and this year the car maker is on track to reach its 1,000 per year production target , a company spokesman insisted .
moreover , the car " will be profitable within its lifecycle " of 10-12 years , mr gott insisted .
this should be achieved as the popularity of the phantom grows , mr gott said , explaining that unlike ordinary consumer goods " the brand -lsb- will be -rsb- established over many years " .

much of british manufacturing has disappeared , but one company has managed to remain world class .
rolls-royce is the second largest manufacturer of engines for the global airline industry - as well as for military aicraft and for ships .
its share of the market has risen from a fifth to almost a third in the last ten years .
the company got a recent boost from boeing 's decision to make rolls-royce one of only two engine suppliers for the new " dreamliner " mid-sized jet .
it is boeing 's biggest project in years , and it could ultimately give rolls-royce tens of billions of dollars in new business .
the aero-engine side of rolls-royce is less famous than the luxury car marque -lrb- now owned by bmw -rrb- , but it too has a long and illustrious history .
on display some of it is on display at the company 's in-house heritage centre in derby , an industrial city in the english east midlands .
the company 's roots in aircraft engine making go back to the time of the first world war .
on show at the heritage centre is the engine used in the first transatlantic flight in 1919 .
later on , rolls-royce merlin engines powered the spitfire and hurricane fighter planes that flew in the battle of britain .
the company also produced some of the first jet engines , based on the original design of the inventor of the jet , frank whittle .
we had to decide between third place , or aiming for number one nick devall , rolls-royce the largest item on display is the modern trent 800 engine used on the boeing 777 long range jet .
the modern history of rolls-royce is bound up with the trent .
there 's a version of the engine available to fit virtually every type of plane used by the major airlines .
fighting back everything about the aero-engine industry involves long time scales .
the decisions that shape rolls-royce today were made back in the late 1980s .
at that time , the company 's civil aircraft engine business was in danger of slipping into irrelevance in a market dominated by two larger american companies , general electric and pratt & whitney .
" we had to decide between living off the scraps of being in third place in the market or aiming for the number one position , " says nick devall , head of customer relations at rolls-royce 's civil aviation division .
" then we really only had two or three products . "
so the company decided to develop variants of its products to fit a much wider range of planes .
aircraft engines are hugely expensive to develop , but once the technology is there it can be adapted to fit many different types of plane .
rolls royce makes engines to fit most types of aircraft the company also put more effort into nurturing relations with its customers , as an engine stays in service for a long time .
for airlines , the standard of aftercare and servicing as almost as important in their choice of supplier as the engine itself .
" when you sell an engine you are entering a twenty or even thirty-year relationship with the customer , " explains mr devall .
rolls-royce has now clawed its way up from a distant third place to a vigorous second position in its chosen market .
maintenance fees but the going was far from easy .
like the rest of the aviation industry , rolls-royce went through a very rough patch after the 11 september attacks .
engine orders plummeted as the company 's airline customers went into deep recession .
rolls-royce dealt with the crisis in part by cutting costs and shedding jobs .
but the company also subtly altered the way it gets its revenues .
rolls royce 's aero-engine business has a long history most of its profits come not from selling new engines - intense competition keeps prices down - but from providing spare parts and repairing engines that are already in service .
this means rolls-royce has typically had to wait a long time before seeing a financial return on the huge outlay required to develop new engines .
to ease this problem the company has moved towards what it calls " power by the hour " service contracts with its airline customers .
rolls-royce takes responsibility for maintaining and repairing engines from the day they are delivered in return for a set fee .
this means the company gets revenues more quickly , while airlines get predictable repair bills and a reduction in risk .
making aero-engines is hardly a get-rich-quick sort of business , so rolls-royce has sometimes been out of favour with the stock market .
but , at the moment , all that long-term thinking seems to be paying off .
the company recently reported a big increase in profits , and its share price has more than doubled in value over the past twelve months .

a public debate took place on monday night - with objectors saying the landscape could be spoiled by up to five new wind farms in perthshire .
campaigners argued that a proper strategy needs to be worked out .
however , the executive said that it believed there was already a good system in place .
there are no wind farms in the ochil hills at present and campaigners fear that the landscape will be spoiled . "
we 've got the landscape - we 've got to protect that - we have to look at future power demands and needs and we need time to do that " alison grave wind farms awareness group they are also worried that the next generation of turbines will be much larger than the last .
alison grave of the wind farms awareness group said the plans are significant .
she told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " we have a proposal that is over a quarter of the size of perth and that is just one part of the ochils and there are at least five being proposed in the ochils . "
developers denied the claim that wind farms would reach this scale but ms grave is calling for a halt to the process .
" we really want a temporary moratorium so that we can get a strategy in place to look at the location of the wind farms , " she said .
healthy debate " we 've got the landscape - we 've got to protect that - we have to look at future power demands and needs and we need time to do that .
this is a quick fix dash at the moment . "
a scottish executive spokesman said : " renewable energy does not only help tackle climate change , but also offers significant economic opportunities .
" such energy schemes go through a rigorous planning process to ensure that these developments take account of their impact on local communities and environment .
" also , the forum for renewable energy development in scotland - which is chaired by ministers and includes representatives from the industry and other stakeholders - helps provide national guidance and expertise on the development of the sector . "
the scottish renewables forum , which represents the industry , said there were a number of good locations in the area .
its chief executive rob forest said the outlook was not as bad as opponents feared .
mr forest said : " they are right to have a concern and there should be a debate .
" there 's a lot of projects coming forward in perthshire , we do n't believe that every one of those will go ahead and the planning system is designed to deal with that . "
protesters organised the meeting because they believe many people do not realise what is happening on their doorstep .
