the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .
the copy proves that the hamburg atlas is not a forgery , but an historical record that for the first time gives an accurate idea of how powerful the nazi economy really was . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans claim charles lindbergh is their father three germans have claimed american pilot charles lindbergh , the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , is their father .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .
the copy proves that the hamburg atlas is not a forgery , but an historical record that for the first time gives an accurate idea of how powerful the nazi economy really was . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans claim charles lindbergh is their father three germans have claimed american pilot charles lindbergh , the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , is their father .

the european parliament rejected barroso 's commission largely because of buttiglione , who reaped criticism for his highly conservative views on gays and women . in his press conference on saturday , buttiglione painted himself as an " innocent victim " of a political game . " i am happy that i had the opportunity to represent the values for which i stand and also to suffer as a result of that stand , " said buttiglione , who was to be the commission 's justice chief . it will be now up to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to select a replacement nominee for the 56-year-old philosophy professor with strong ties to the vatican .
observers are betting on current foreign minister franco frattini . easier for barroso the italian 's withdrawal makes things easier for barroso who , according to eu rules , would have only been able to assign buttiglione another comission job had the italian not resigned . barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . " there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " on friday , the portuguese prime minister-designate made clear that several other commission candidates were on the chopping block .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission job , neelie kroes , hungary 's laszlo kovacs , up for the energy commissioner post and latvia 's ingrida udre , a nominee for the taxation post , are considered likely victims . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso says reshuffle will be limited a day after withdrawing his initial line-up , european commission president-in-waiting jose barroso says changes to his proposed executive will be limited .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .
the copy proves that the hamburg atlas is not a forgery , but an historical record that for the first time gives an accurate idea of how powerful the nazi economy really was . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans claim charles lindbergh is their father three germans have claimed american pilot charles lindbergh , the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , is their father .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .

armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .

but when clocks in europe were set back an hour sunday morning , many went home empty-handed . successful ebay bidders need to be quick of mind and quick on the mouse .
but all the speed in the world ca n't help when the internet auction house ca n't get the time change right .
in the night from saturday to sunday , clocks in the european union were set back one hour .
in order to compensate , ebay said it would end auctions that started before the time change one hour earlier after the time change .
in doing so , the site wanted to make sure to eliminate the extra hour given europeans when they set their clocks back .
but bidders complained in the site 's forum on sunday that auctions ended an hour earlier than planned .
as a result , many bidders found the items they were after sold far too early .
one person who auctioned off his washing machine was burned when the auction ended too early , before anyone made any serious bids .
" the whirlpool , that i put up for auction , sold for only € 2.50 , " he wrote in the ebay forum .
ebay technicians told the forum they were working on the problem . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .

armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .
the copy proves that the hamburg atlas is not a forgery , but an historical record that for the first time gives an accurate idea of how powerful the nazi economy really was . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans claim charles lindbergh is their father three germans have claimed american pilot charles lindbergh , the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , is their father .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .
the copy proves that the hamburg atlas is not a forgery , but an historical record that for the first time gives an accurate idea of how powerful the nazi economy really was . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans claim charles lindbergh is their father three germans have claimed american pilot charles lindbergh , the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , is their father .

but when clocks in europe were set back an hour sunday morning , many went home empty-handed . successful ebay bidders need to be quick of mind and quick on the mouse .
but all the speed in the world ca n't help when the internet auction house ca n't get the time change right .
in the night from saturday to sunday , clocks in the european union were set back one hour .
in order to compensate , ebay said it would end auctions that started before the time change one hour earlier after the time change .
in doing so , the site wanted to make sure to eliminate the extra hour given europeans when they set their clocks back .
but bidders complained in the site 's forum on sunday that auctions ended an hour earlier than planned .
as a result , many bidders found the items they were after sold far too early .
one person who auctioned off his washing machine was burned when the auction ended too early , before anyone made any serious bids .
" the whirlpool , that i put up for auction , sold for only € 2.50 , " he wrote in the ebay forum .
ebay technicians told the forum they were working on the problem . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but when clocks in europe were set back an hour sunday morning , many went home empty-handed . successful ebay bidders need to be quick of mind and quick on the mouse .
but all the speed in the world ca n't help when the internet auction house ca n't get the time change right .
in the night from saturday to sunday , clocks in the european union were set back one hour .
in order to compensate , ebay said it would end auctions that started before the time change one hour earlier after the time change .
in doing so , the site wanted to make sure to eliminate the extra hour given europeans when they set their clocks back .
but bidders complained in the site 's forum on sunday that auctions ended an hour earlier than planned .
as a result , many bidders found the items they were after sold far too early .
one person who auctioned off his washing machine was burned when the auction ended too early , before anyone made any serious bids .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .
the copy proves that the hamburg atlas is not a forgery , but an historical record that for the first time gives an accurate idea of how powerful the nazi economy really was . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans claim charles lindbergh is their father three germans have claimed american pilot charles lindbergh , the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , is their father .

the european parliament rejected barroso 's commission largely because of buttiglione , who reaped criticism for his highly conservative views on gays and women . in his press conference on saturday , buttiglione painted himself as an " innocent victim " of a political game . " i am happy that i had the opportunity to represent the values for which i stand and also to suffer as a result of that stand , " said buttiglione , who was to be the commission 's justice chief . it will be now up to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to select a replacement nominee for the 56-year-old philosophy professor with strong ties to the vatican .
observers are betting on current foreign minister franco frattini . easier for barroso the italian 's withdrawal makes things easier for barroso who , according to eu rules , would have only been able to assign buttiglione another comission job had the italian not resigned . barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . " there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " on friday , the portuguese prime minister-designate made clear that several other commission candidates were on the chopping block .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission job , neelie kroes , hungary 's laszlo kovacs , up for the energy commissioner post and latvia 's ingrida udre , a nominee for the taxation post , are considered likely victims . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso says reshuffle will be limited a day after withdrawing his initial line-up , european commission president-in-waiting jose barroso says changes to his proposed executive will be limited .

but when clocks in europe were set back an hour sunday morning , many went home empty-handed . successful ebay bidders need to be quick of mind and quick on the mouse .
but all the speed in the world ca n't help when the internet auction house ca n't get the time change right .
in the night from saturday to sunday , clocks in the european union were set back one hour .
in order to compensate , ebay said it would end auctions that started before the time change one hour earlier after the time change .
in doing so , the site wanted to make sure to eliminate the extra hour given europeans when they set their clocks back .
but bidders complained in the site 's forum on sunday that auctions ended an hour earlier than planned .
as a result , many bidders found the items they were after sold far too early .
one person who auctioned off his washing machine was burned when the auction ended too early , before anyone made any serious bids .
" the whirlpool , that i put up for auction , sold for only € 2.50 , " he wrote in the ebay forum .

the european parliament rejected barroso 's commission largely because of buttiglione , who reaped criticism for his highly conservative views on gays and women . in his press conference on saturday , buttiglione painted himself as an " innocent victim " of a political game . " i am happy that i had the opportunity to represent the values for which i stand and also to suffer as a result of that stand , " said buttiglione , who was to be the commission 's justice chief . it will be now up to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi to select a replacement nominee for the 56-year-old philosophy professor with strong ties to the vatican .
observers are betting on current foreign minister franco frattini . easier for barroso the italian 's withdrawal makes things easier for barroso who , according to eu rules , would have only been able to assign buttiglione another comission job had the italian not resigned . barroso backed down wednesday in a high-stakes stand-off with eu lawmakers , withdrawing his proposed team and plunging the eu into uncharted constitutional waters . " there will not be an extensive reshuffle , it will be very limited , " he said on europe 1 radio thursday , adding that the new list would be ready " in less than a month , i hope . " on friday , the portuguese prime minister-designate made clear that several other commission candidates were on the chopping block .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission job , neelie kroes , hungary 's laszlo kovacs , up for the energy commissioner post and latvia 's ingrida udre , a nominee for the taxation post , are considered likely victims . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso says reshuffle will be limited a day after withdrawing his initial line-up , european commission president-in-waiting jose barroso says changes to his proposed executive will be limited .

the maps showed not only the raw material resources over which germany had control , but the country 's industrial capacity as well . historians believe the atlas , which re-appeared after almost 60 years in hamburg and was re-published last week , informed american policy towards postwar western germany .
its detailed descriptions of the nazi war machine and its resources are unique and offer historians the first accurate estimation of what the nazis were capable of . " it 's a once-in-a-lifetime discovery , " said economic historian werner abelshauser , at a press conference introducing the publication last week . used atlas to rebuild germany after its seizure , the atlas made its way to washington where it was pored over and then forgotten .
last year , a copy of the atlas left in an inheritance in hamburg was handed to german book publishers who immediately set about getting it into print .
the large-format atlas sells for € 178 -lrb- $ 227 -rrb- . abelshauser said he is sure washington officials used the information held in " görings atlas " to re-direct their reconstruction policy . the americans used the astounding amount of resources and industrial capacity in western germany to help the country rebuild , rather than implementing a policy of punishment , as the soviets did in the east , said abelshauser . contrary to what the allied powers thought , american and british bombers did not wipe out germany 's industrial production facilities .
armed with the information , reconstruction officials were able to use those facilities to spur on the country 's postwar economic miracle . " the maps were surely a big part of the reason that america 's european strategy changed dramatically in 1946 , " said abelshauser . the discovery of the atlas last year led to the additional discovery that a copy of the book sat forgotten in the library of congress for decades .
the copy proves that the hamburg atlas is not a forgery , but an historical record that for the first time gives an accurate idea of how powerful the nazi economy really was . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans claim charles lindbergh is their father three germans have claimed american pilot charles lindbergh , the first person to fly solo across the atlantic , is their father .

a european union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions .
it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii .
it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism .
combining real and virtual the technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site .
the lifeplus project is part of the eu 's information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage .
engineers and researchers working in the europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system .
it would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer .
the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor 's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements .
at pompeii for example , the visitor would not just see the frescos , taverns and villas that have been excavated , but also people going about their daily life .
augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming .
bringing past to life " this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games , " said professor nadia magnenat-thalman of the swiss research group miralab . "
the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer-generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life " andrew stoddart , 2d3 " we are , for the first time , able to run this combination of software processes to create walking , talking people with believable clothing , skin and hair in real-time , " she said .
unlike virtual reality , which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer , the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views .
crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor 's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements .
the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company , 2d3 .
andrew stoddart , chief scientist at 2d3 , said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life .

a european union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions .
it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii .
it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism .
combining real and virtual the technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site .
pompeii would be peopled by computer-generated characters the lifeplus project is part of the eu 's information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage .
engineers and researchers working in the europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system .
it would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer .
the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor 's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements .
at pompeii for example , the visitor would not just see the frescos , taverns and villas that have been excavated , but also people going about their daily life .
augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming .

unlike virtual reality , which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer , the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views .
crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor 's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements .

it is being described as the most comprehensive modernisation programme for scottish schools in a generation .
plans being outlined by education minister peter peacock on monday will include a " new look curriculum . "
but conservative education spokesman lord james douglas-hamilton attacked the reforms as " phoney " and lacking in choice for youngsters .
he said : " until the pupils can choose the schools rather than the schools choosing the pupils - as at present - we will never be able to offer true choice that our children deserve . "
mr peacock said : " the reforms i will unveil are the most far-reaching in our schools for a generation and good leadership is needed to make them work .
' mediocre ' schools " those with the drive and ambition to deliver change will be given all the help and support they need . "
head teachers are being sent back to school for lessons in leadership at a new national academy , set up with the aim of supporting their role .
the minister said strong leadership would lift schools out of " mediocrity " .
under the new measures all teachers will get more freedom within a framework of continued support from local authorities .
in particular , head teachers will be allowed to decide what learning needs best suit their pupils .
pupils will be given wider subject choice and more time to do well in their best subjects .
proposals are expected to recommend that learning is focused on achieving a clear set of broad outcomes for young people leaving school , in the first single curriculum for three to 18-year-olds .
