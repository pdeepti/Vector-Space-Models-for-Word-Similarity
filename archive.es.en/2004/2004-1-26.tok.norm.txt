despite declining consumer spending , germans are still shop-a-holics at heart and stocking up on basics during the annual winter clearance sale – the last of its kind , thanks to changing retail laws . it 's the end of a retail era in germany as the last of the official twice yearly clearance sales , the " schlussverkauf , " got underway on monday .
soon , price-conscious german shoppers will be free to hunt for bargains year round : a revised law on clearance sales will go into effect this spring , putting an end to the current system , which prohibits stores from offering goods at bargain basement prices outside of the legally-mandated sale periods .
but will shoppers emerge with the same sense of victory if they no longer have to line up outside the shop doors in the wee hours of the morning and trade elbow jabs with other would-be bargain hunters ?
times they are a changing in 2003 , the german bundestag voted to revise the nearly 100-year-old law , which restricted retailers of mostly clothing items from holding clearance sales except during twice-yearly two week periods – one in january and one in july .
retailers had lobbied hard for more freedom to lure in shoppers as the german economy is in the doldrums and consumer spending declining – sales of merchandise other than food dropped for the second year in a row by 2.1 percent , according to the federal statistics office .
the revised legislation on clearance sales is the latest in a series measures aimed at loosening germany 's restrictive retail laws .

hyperbole aside , discounts of up to 50 percent seem to be working : sales are up by 3 to 4 percent compared to last year , according to harald lemke , the manager of a department store in brandenburg .
the real test of the change will come later this year , when german consumers will have to acclimatize to the change .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2004 closing arguments given in cannibal trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes says he deeply regrets killing a man and eating him .
the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

despite declining consumer spending , germans are still shop-a-holics at heart and stocking up on basics during the annual winter clearance sale – the last of its kind , thanks to changing retail laws . it 's the end of a retail era in germany as the last of the official twice yearly clearance sales , the " schlussverkauf , " got underway on monday .
soon , price-conscious german shoppers will be free to hunt for bargains year round : a revised law on clearance sales will go into effect this spring , putting an end to the current system , which prohibits stores from offering goods at bargain basement prices outside of the legally-mandated sale periods .
but will shoppers emerge with the same sense of victory if they no longer have to line up outside the shop doors in the wee hours of the morning and trade elbow jabs with other would-be bargain hunters ?
times they are a changing in 2003 , the german bundestag voted to revise the nearly 100-year-old law , which restricted retailers of mostly clothing items from holding clearance sales except during twice-yearly two week periods – one in january and one in july .
retailers had lobbied hard for more freedom to lure in shoppers as the german economy is in the doldrums and consumer spending declining – sales of merchandise other than food dropped for the second year in a row by 2.1 percent , according to the federal statistics office .
the revised legislation on clearance sales is the latest in a series measures aimed at loosening germany 's restrictive retail laws .
also in 2003 , the bundestag voted to allow stores to stay open an extra four hours on saturdays , until 8 pm .
a “ fireworks of savings ” despite the general downward trend in consumer spending , this last winter clearance is off to a good start .
department stores flung open their doors earlier than usual , allowing hundreds of shoppers , many of whom had been waiting in long lines for several hours , to stream inside .
there , retailers already expected them with a “ fireworks of savings , ” according to hubertus pellengahr , a spokesperson for the association of german retailers .
hyperbole aside , discounts of up to 50 percent seem to be working : sales are up by 3 to 4 percent compared to last year , according to harald lemke , the manager of a department store in brandenburg .
the real test of the change will come later this year , when german consumers will have to acclimatize to the change .
will they still show up in the same droves when the frenzy and finite time-frame surrounding the official " clearance sales " gives way to somewhat more subdued and lower-key year round savings ?
german retailers are hoping the german tendency to bargain hunt is not limited to certain times of the year . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de end of a retailing era the almost 100-year-old tradition of twice-yearly clearance sales at german retailers looks to be coming to a close .

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2004 aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis ' headquarters near strasbourg , france .
french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .

an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .

most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .

" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

despite declining consumer spending , germans are still shop-a-holics at heart and stocking up on basics during the annual winter clearance sale – the last of its kind , thanks to changing retail laws . it 's the end of a retail era in germany as the last of the official twice yearly clearance sales , the " schlussverkauf , " got underway on monday .
soon , price-conscious german shoppers will be free to hunt for bargains year round : a revised law on clearance sales will go into effect this spring , putting an end to the current system , which prohibits stores from offering goods at bargain basement prices outside of the legally-mandated sale periods .
but will shoppers emerge with the same sense of victory if they no longer have to line up outside the shop doors in the wee hours of the morning and trade elbow jabs with other would-be bargain hunters ?
times they are a changing in 2003 , the german bundestag voted to revise the nearly 100-year-old law , which restricted retailers of mostly clothing items from holding clearance sales except during twice-yearly two week periods – one in january and one in july .
retailers had lobbied hard for more freedom to lure in shoppers as the german economy is in the doldrums and consumer spending declining – sales of merchandise other than food dropped for the second year in a row by 2.1 percent , according to the federal statistics office .
the revised legislation on clearance sales is the latest in a series measures aimed at loosening germany 's restrictive retail laws .
also in 2003 , the bundestag voted to allow stores to stay open an extra four hours on saturdays , until 8 pm .
a “ fireworks of savings ” despite the general downward trend in consumer spending , this last winter clearance is off to a good start .
department stores flung open their doors earlier than usual , allowing hundreds of shoppers , many of whom had been waiting in long lines for several hours , to stream inside .
there , retailers already expected them with a “ fireworks of savings , ” according to hubertus pellengahr , a spokesperson for the association of german retailers .
hyperbole aside , discounts of up to 50 percent seem to be working : sales are up by 3 to 4 percent compared to last year , according to harald lemke , the manager of a department store in brandenburg .
the real test of the change will come later this year , when german consumers will have to acclimatize to the change .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .
and that 's also why we 're going to the european court -lrb- of human rights -rrb- in strasbourg .

despite declining consumer spending , germans are still shop-a-holics at heart and stocking up on basics during the annual winter clearance sale – the last of its kind , thanks to changing retail laws . it 's the end of a retail era in germany as the last of the official twice yearly clearance sales , the " schlussverkauf , " got underway on monday .
soon , price-conscious german shoppers will be free to hunt for bargains year round : a revised law on clearance sales will go into effect this spring , putting an end to the current system , which prohibits stores from offering goods at bargain basement prices outside of the legally-mandated sale periods .
but will shoppers emerge with the same sense of victory if they no longer have to line up outside the shop doors in the wee hours of the morning and trade elbow jabs with other would-be bargain hunters ?

retailers had lobbied hard for more freedom to lure in shoppers as the german economy is in the doldrums and consumer spending declining – sales of merchandise other than food dropped for the second year in a row by 2.1 percent , according to the federal statistics office .
the revised legislation on clearance sales is the latest in a series measures aimed at loosening germany 's restrictive retail laws .

the real test of the change will come later this year , when german consumers will have to acclimatize to the change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2004 aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis ' headquarters near strasbourg , france .
french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2004 closing arguments given in cannibal trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes says he deeply regrets killing a man and eating him .
the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2004 dispossessed berlin wall land owners hope for justice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who owns the property upon which the berlin wall stood ?
the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .

despite declining consumer spending , germans are still shop-a-holics at heart and stocking up on basics during the annual winter clearance sale – the last of its kind , thanks to changing retail laws . it 's the end of a retail era in germany as the last of the official twice yearly clearance sales , the " schlussverkauf , " got underway on monday .
soon , price-conscious german shoppers will be free to hunt for bargains year round : a revised law on clearance sales will go into effect this spring , putting an end to the current system , which prohibits stores from offering goods at bargain basement prices outside of the legally-mandated sale periods .
but will shoppers emerge with the same sense of victory if they no longer have to line up outside the shop doors in the wee hours of the morning and trade elbow jabs with other would-be bargain hunters ?
times they are a changing in 2003 , the german bundestag voted to revise the nearly 100-year-old law , which restricted retailers of mostly clothing items from holding clearance sales except during twice-yearly two week periods – one in january and one in july .
retailers had lobbied hard for more freedom to lure in shoppers as the german economy is in the doldrums and consumer spending declining – sales of merchandise other than food dropped for the second year in a row by 2.1 percent , according to the federal statistics office .
the revised legislation on clearance sales is the latest in a series measures aimed at loosening germany 's restrictive retail laws .
also in 2003 , the bundestag voted to allow stores to stay open an extra four hours on saturdays , until 8 pm .
a “ fireworks of savings ” despite the general downward trend in consumer spending , this last winter clearance is off to a good start .
department stores flung open their doors earlier than usual , allowing hundreds of shoppers , many of whom had been waiting in long lines for several hours , to stream inside .
there , retailers already expected them with a “ fireworks of savings , ” according to hubertus pellengahr , a spokesperson for the association of german retailers .
hyperbole aside , discounts of up to 50 percent seem to be working : sales are up by 3 to 4 percent compared to last year , according to harald lemke , the manager of a department store in brandenburg .
the real test of the change will come later this year , when german consumers will have to acclimatize to the change .
will they still show up in the same droves when the frenzy and finite time-frame surrounding the official " clearance sales " gives way to somewhat more subdued and lower-key year round savings ?

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .
and that 's also why we 're going to the european court -lrb- of human rights -rrb- in strasbourg .

3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .
and that 's also why we 're going to the european court -lrb- of human rights -rrb- in strasbourg .

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .

aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "

" sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

british premier tony blair faces one of the toughest weeks of his career : first he could suffer a defeat in parliament tuesday , followed by the wednesday release of a report on the death of an expert on iraq ’ s weapons . few believe the british leader will soon be out of office , but blair ’ s challenges during what has been dubbed his " week from hell " are serious nonetheless .
despite the overwhelming majority in parliament of his labour party , tuesday ’ s vote on a proposal to increase university tuition fees is still too close to call . the controversial bill will fail if all opposition members and 81 labour parliamentarians vote against it – 155 labour legislators have already signed a motion opposing the fee hike .
should the proposal fail , a confidence vote on blair 's leadership might follow . even before the vote , blair is scheduled to receive an advance copy of a report that also poses a potential threat to his premiership : the so-called hutton inquiry into the government ’ s involvement in the suicide of u.k. scientist david kelly -lrb- photo . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly . a defense ministry employee , the expert on iraq ’ s weapons slit his wrists after he was named as a source for news reports claiming that the government had knowingly used false information on iraq ’ s alleged arsenal of weapons of mass destruction . government struggles to justify iraq war regardless of the reports ’ findings , the british government on monday tried to justify their support of the war in iraq after chief u.s. arms hunter david kay said he did not believe that former iraqi dictator saddam hussein had access to biological or chemical weapons .
kay quit his job last week . in a bbc interview , british foreign secretary jack straw expressed his disappointment in the failure to find weapons until now but added that the search will continue .
“ a great deal more evidence will emerge , ” he said . blair biography talks of tensions with chirac the publication of a new blair biography on monday created yet another area needing damage control for the blair .
according to the book ’ s author , blair thought french president jacques chirac was “ out to get him ” during the lead-up to the war , which was opposed by france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac , left , and blair at a london press conference last november .
“ i ’ m convinced he believed the conflict with chirac had expanded beyond iraq to become a contest for the political leadership of europe , ” financial times political columnist philip stephens told reuters news agency .
in his book , stephens writes blair based his fears partly on reports from british intelligence about chirac ’ s private conversations . in recent months , however , the two leaders have appeared to get closer again .
a series of tri-lateral summits including german chancellor gerhard schröder also seems to indicate the three countries ’ desire to serve as the motor of european unity .
the trio ’ s next meeting to prepare an eu summit in march is scheduled to take place in berlin on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2004 closing arguments given in cannibal trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin meiwes says he deeply regrets killing a man and eating him .
the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "
a verdict is expected on friday . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cannibal not mentally ill , psychiatrist says a german on trial for killing and eating another man knew what he was doing and can be held criminally liable for his actions , a psychiatrist testified .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

british premier tony blair faces one of the toughest weeks of his career : first he could suffer a defeat in parliament tuesday , followed by the wednesday release of a report on the death of an expert on iraq ’ s weapons . few believe the british leader will soon be out of office , but blair ’ s challenges during what has been dubbed his " week from hell " are serious nonetheless .
despite the overwhelming majority in parliament of his labour party , tuesday ’ s vote on a proposal to increase university tuition fees is still too close to call . the controversial bill will fail if all opposition members and 81 labour parliamentarians vote against it – 155 labour legislators have already signed a motion opposing the fee hike .
should the proposal fail , a confidence vote on blair 's leadership might follow . even before the vote , blair is scheduled to receive an advance copy of a report that also poses a potential threat to his premiership : the so-called hutton inquiry into the government ’ s involvement in the suicide of u.k. scientist david kelly -lrb- photo . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly . a defense ministry employee , the expert on iraq ’ s weapons slit his wrists after he was named as a source for news reports claiming that the government had knowingly used false information on iraq ’ s alleged arsenal of weapons of mass destruction . government struggles to justify iraq war regardless of the reports ’ findings , the british government on monday tried to justify their support of the war in iraq after chief u.s. arms hunter david kay said he did not believe that former iraqi dictator saddam hussein had access to biological or chemical weapons .
kay quit his job last week . in a bbc interview , british foreign secretary jack straw expressed his disappointment in the failure to find weapons until now but added that the search will continue .
“ a great deal more evidence will emerge , ” he said . blair biography talks of tensions with chirac the publication of a new blair biography on monday created yet another area needing damage control for the blair .
according to the book ’ s author , blair thought french president jacques chirac was “ out to get him ” during the lead-up to the war , which was opposed by france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac , left , and blair at a london press conference last november .
“ i ’ m convinced he believed the conflict with chirac had expanded beyond iraq to become a contest for the political leadership of europe , ” financial times political columnist philip stephens told reuters news agency .
in his book , stephens writes blair based his fears partly on reports from british intelligence about chirac ’ s private conversations . in recent months , however , the two leaders have appeared to get closer again .
a series of tri-lateral summits including german chancellor gerhard schröder also seems to indicate the three countries ’ desire to serve as the motor of european unity .
the trio ’ s next meeting to prepare an eu summit in march is scheduled to take place in berlin on feb .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .

british premier tony blair faces one of the toughest weeks of his career : first he could suffer a defeat in parliament tuesday , followed by the wednesday release of a report on the death of an expert on iraq ’ s weapons . few believe the british leader will soon be out of office , but blair ’ s challenges during what has been dubbed his " week from hell " are serious nonetheless .
despite the overwhelming majority in parliament of his labour party , tuesday ’ s vote on a proposal to increase university tuition fees is still too close to call . the controversial bill will fail if all opposition members and 81 labour parliamentarians vote against it – 155 labour legislators have already signed a motion opposing the fee hike .
should the proposal fail , a confidence vote on blair 's leadership might follow . even before the vote , blair is scheduled to receive an advance copy of a report that also poses a potential threat to his premiership : the so-called hutton inquiry into the government ’ s involvement in the suicide of u.k. scientist david kelly -lrb- photo . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly . a defense ministry employee , the expert on iraq ’ s weapons slit his wrists after he was named as a source for news reports claiming that the government had knowingly used false information on iraq ’ s alleged arsenal of weapons of mass destruction . government struggles to justify iraq war regardless of the reports ’ findings , the british government on monday tried to justify their support of the war in iraq after chief u.s. arms hunter david kay said he did not believe that former iraqi dictator saddam hussein had access to biological or chemical weapons .
kay quit his job last week . in a bbc interview , british foreign secretary jack straw expressed his disappointment in the failure to find weapons until now but added that the search will continue .
“ a great deal more evidence will emerge , ” he said . blair biography talks of tensions with chirac the publication of a new blair biography on monday created yet another area needing damage control for the blair .
according to the book ’ s author , blair thought french president jacques chirac was “ out to get him ” during the lead-up to the war , which was opposed by france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac , left , and blair at a london press conference last november .
“ i ’ m convinced he believed the conflict with chirac had expanded beyond iraq to become a contest for the political leadership of europe , ” financial times political columnist philip stephens told reuters news agency .
in his book , stephens writes blair based his fears partly on reports from british intelligence about chirac ’ s private conversations . in recent months , however , the two leaders have appeared to get closer again .
a series of tri-lateral summits including german chancellor gerhard schröder also seems to indicate the three countries ’ desire to serve as the motor of european unity .
the trio ’ s next meeting to prepare an eu summit in march is scheduled to take place in berlin on feb .

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .
" we could n't have been treated more meanly .
and that 's also why we 're going to the european court -lrb- of human rights -rrb- in strasbourg . " ernst meinhardt -lrb- ni -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal .
-lrb- jan .
22 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should germany be forced to compensate the former owners of property upon which the berlin wall was built , although they acquired the land thanks to a communist agrarian reform whose legality was dubious ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

british premier tony blair faces one of the toughest weeks of his career : first he could suffer a defeat in parliament tuesday , followed by the wednesday release of a report on the death of an expert on iraq ’ s weapons . few believe the british leader will soon be out of office , but blair ’ s challenges during what has been dubbed his " week from hell " are serious nonetheless .
despite the overwhelming majority in parliament of his labour party , tuesday ’ s vote on a proposal to increase university tuition fees is still too close to call . the controversial bill will fail if all opposition members and 81 labour parliamentarians vote against it – 155 labour legislators have already signed a motion opposing the fee hike .
should the proposal fail , a confidence vote on blair 's leadership might follow . even before the vote , blair is scheduled to receive an advance copy of a report that also poses a potential threat to his premiership : the so-called hutton inquiry into the government ’ s involvement in the suicide of u.k. scientist david kelly -lrb- photo . -rrb-

should the proposal fail , a confidence vote on blair 's leadership might follow . even before the vote , blair is scheduled to receive an advance copy of a report that also poses a potential threat to his premiership : the so-called hutton inquiry into the government ’ s involvement in the suicide of u.k. scientist david kelly -lrb- photo . -rrb-

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .

soon , price-conscious german shoppers will be free to hunt for bargains year round : a revised law on clearance sales will go into effect this spring , putting an end to the current system , which prohibits stores from offering goods at bargain basement prices outside of the legally-mandated sale periods .

retailers had lobbied hard for more freedom to lure in shoppers as the german economy is in the doldrums and consumer spending declining – sales of merchandise other than food dropped for the second year in a row by 2.1 percent , according to the federal statistics office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2004 dispossessed berlin wall land owners hope for justice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who owns the property upon which the berlin wall stood ?
the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.01.2004 dispossessed berlin wall land owners hope for justice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who owns the property upon which the berlin wall stood ?
the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .
until german unification on oct .
3 , 1990 , the four power status , which established the jurisdiction of britain , france , the soviet union and the united states over the city 's four sectors , still applied to berlin .
since the allies had declared the city a demilitarized zone , the gdr had no right to apply its " defense law " of sept .
20 , 1961 , which legalized construction of the wall . in 1996 , the german parliament passed legislation regulating the return of berlin wall property .
it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .
at its height , 250 people were members - an indication that more and more owners are becoming resigned .
the property owners ' main problem is they have no lobby .
when the governing coalition parties passed the law on berlin wall property , the then-opposition , the social democrats and the greens , said they would reverse the law when they got in power .
but when the time came , in 1998 , they forgot their promise and assumed the same point of view as the former government . joachim hildebrandt , a member in the owners group , said the flip-flop gave him additional stimulus not to give up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2004 aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis ' headquarters near strasbourg , france .
french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .

it requires people who reclaim their property to pay the government 25 percent of its current value .
the government is obliged to pay the former owner 75 percent of the land 's value in compensation if it can not be returned - if , for example , it 's used for a street .
most of the former property owners do n't accept those conditions . pithy compensation konrad bautz and his mother were evicted from their house in 1961 , when construction on the wall began .
they would be allowed to return in a matter of weeks , when the western allies would leave berlin , his mother was told .
days after bautz and his mother moved into the apartment they had been allotted a neighbor called to tell him that gdr soldiers were demolishing his house .
" i took a taxi there .
the house was already missing a roof , " bautz recalled .
the gdr paid bautz 10,000 east german marks in compensation . since september 2003 , around 600 claims have been filed for the return of berlin wall properties , according to the german finance ministry .
only a quarter of the claimants are prepared to pay the 25 percent necessary to buy back their old property .
the government is using 10 percent of the real estate , which , thus , can not be returned .
more than 130 applications have not yet been processed . red-green flip-flop around 120 people are organized in the group of former owners of berlin wall property .

the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances . to the former owners of property that was confiscated for the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 , the land they once owned can only be reclaimed under conditions they consider unjust .
the dispossessed have been organized for twelve years now , however , despite all the work they have put into their cause , they have achieved virtually nothing in their standoff with the german government and the justice system . but now , the european court of human rights has given new impetus to the former property owners with its ruling last thursday that germany had violated the european convention on human rights .
the court said germany had violated the protection of private property by repossessing land that had been allocated to farmers and refugees in the communist gdr agrarian reform .
it should have provided them with compensation .
the german government is expected to be overwhelmed with a barrage of compensation claims and costs that could amount to billions . a berlin district court had pronounced a judgment earlier this month that although east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- did violate the four-power status of berlin by building the wall , the court could not take that as a basis for a ruling . violating international law german courts have consistently applied the same logic when they have ruled in cases where former property owners have sued to regain their land .
but those who lost their property 43 years ago argue that the berlin wall violated international law .

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .
according to köhler , meiwes later used his video for sexual satisfaction and to admire his work as a " human butcher . "

the prosecutor in the german state of hesse has called for a life-long sentence for confessed cannibal armin meiwes , who admitted to slaughtering and eating a 42-year-old man from berlin in spring 2001 . closing arguments were given monday in a kassel regional court where germany ’ s " cannibal of rotenburg " is on trial for killing a man , eating his genitalia and then freezing the rest of his body to consume in later repasts .
" the desire to slaughter a man and eat him up was the paramount motive for his action , " said prosecutor marcus köhler .
" he slaughtered his victim like a piece of livestock and treated him as an object of fancy . "
meiwes ’ attorney , harald ermel , has said that the cannibal can only be prosecuted on a charge of assisted suicide , which would carry a maximum prison term of five years .
his victim , identified in the case only as bernd-jürgen b. , volunteered to be killed after answering an internet ad placed by 42-year-old meiwes seeking " young men for real slaughter and consumption . "
but prosecutor köhler said meiwes had been aware that his victim was suffering from a serious personality disorder and was unable to think rationally .
a human butcher the trial has proven to be one of the most riveting and salacious to take place in germany in decades .
among the evidence in the case is a video in which meiwes films himself slaughtering his victim in a scene straight out of the " texas chainsaw massacre , " complete with meat hooks , a cage and a butcher ’ s table .
in resting his case on monday , meiwes said he " regretted all that i have done " and asked for god ’ s help .
even if his cannibalistic fantasies continued , he said , he would not kill any more people , adding that he only killed his first victim because it was his expressed wish to die .
but prosecutor köhler said the trial had proven that meiwes murdered his victim for his sexual gratification and to fulfill his cannibalistic yearnings .
a cold-blooded killer ?
a psychiatrist testifying in the case on friday described meiwes as fit to stand trial .
" there ’ s no evidence of a psychological disorder , " said george stolpmann .
he added that the 42-year-old had a " schizoid personality " and has problems forming relationships .
" what we have here is an inability to have warm and tender feelings toward others , " he said .
in december , meiwes said he was not acting out of sexual desire when he killed bernd-jürgen b. , but rather out of loneliness and the desire for the brother he never had .
i wanted " someone to be part of me , " he told the court .
prosecutors , however , are painting an altogether different picture , describing the act as a power move aimed at building his self-worth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2004 aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis ' headquarters near strasbourg , france .
french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

despite declining consumer spending , germans are still shop-a-holics at heart and stocking up on basics during the annual winter clearance sale – the last of its kind , thanks to changing retail laws . it 's the end of a retail era in germany as the last of the official twice yearly clearance sales , the " schlussverkauf , " got underway on monday .
soon , price-conscious german shoppers will be free to hunt for bargains year round : a revised law on clearance sales will go into effect this spring , putting an end to the current system , which prohibits stores from offering goods at bargain basement prices outside of the legally-mandated sale periods .
but will shoppers emerge with the same sense of victory if they no longer have to line up outside the shop doors in the wee hours of the morning and trade elbow jabs with other would-be bargain hunters ?
times they are a changing in 2003 , the german bundestag voted to revise the nearly 100-year-old law , which restricted retailers of mostly clothing items from holding clearance sales except during twice-yearly two week periods – one in january and one in july .
retailers had lobbied hard for more freedom to lure in shoppers as the german economy is in the doldrums and consumer spending declining – sales of merchandise other than food dropped for the second year in a row by 2.1 percent , according to the federal statistics office .
the revised legislation on clearance sales is the latest in a series measures aimed at loosening germany 's restrictive retail laws .
also in 2003 , the bundestag voted to allow stores to stay open an extra four hours on saturdays , until 8 pm .
a “ fireworks of savings ” despite the general downward trend in consumer spending , this last winter clearance is off to a good start .
department stores flung open their doors earlier than usual , allowing hundreds of shoppers , many of whom had been waiting in long lines for several hours , to stream inside .
there , retailers already expected them with a “ fireworks of savings , ” according to hubertus pellengahr , a spokesperson for the association of german retailers .
hyperbole aside , discounts of up to 50 percent seem to be working : sales are up by 3 to 4 percent compared to last year , according to harald lemke , the manager of a department store in brandenburg .
the real test of the change will come later this year , when german consumers will have to acclimatize to the change .
will they still show up in the same droves when the frenzy and finite time-frame surrounding the official " clearance sales " gives way to somewhat more subdued and lower-key year round savings ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.01.2004 aventis moves to prevent hostile takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aventis ' headquarters near strasbourg , france .
french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

british premier tony blair faces one of the toughest weeks of his career : first he could suffer a defeat in parliament tuesday , followed by the wednesday release of a report on the death of an expert on iraq ’ s weapons . few believe the british leader will soon be out of office , but blair ’ s challenges during what has been dubbed his " week from hell " are serious nonetheless .
despite the overwhelming majority in parliament of his labour party , tuesday ’ s vote on a proposal to increase university tuition fees is still too close to call . the controversial bill will fail if all opposition members and 81 labour parliamentarians vote against it – 155 labour legislators have already signed a motion opposing the fee hike .
should the proposal fail , a confidence vote on blair 's leadership might follow . even before the vote , blair is scheduled to receive an advance copy of a report that also poses a potential threat to his premiership : the so-called hutton inquiry into the government ’ s involvement in the suicide of u.k. scientist david kelly -lrb- photo . -rrb-

french pharmaceutical company sanofi-synthelabo wants to acquire the franco-german drug-maker aventis in a hostile takeover .
if the € 50 billion merger is successful , it would create the world 's third-largest pharma firm . paris-based drug group sanofi-synthelabo on monday announced a hostile takeover bid for the larger franco-german pharmaceutical conglomerate aventis .
if successful , the move would create europe 's largest pharmaceutical company and the third largest firm in the world behind the america 's pfizer and britain 's glaxosmithkline .
sanofi 's combined stock and cash offer is valued at about € 47.8 billion .
the french firm is offering five of it 's six shares , plus € 69 for six aventis shares .
an alternate deal for shareholders promises 35 sanofi shares for 34 aventis shares , amounting to € 60.43 per share .
although half the size of it 's competitor , sanofi is asking for a 100 percent takeover of aventis and demanding 50 percent of aventis shares and voting rights - a bold move that sanofi is able to make because of aventis ' currently weaker financial position .
a small fish with a big market cap though aventis ' annual sales of about € 20.6 billion eclipse those of sanofi , which counts about € 8 billion a year in revenues , the firms stocks carry a comparable value on the market .
the move had been expected in financial circles for the past several weeks , but sanofi had denied its intentions until monday morning , when sanofi ceo chairman jean-francois dehecq announced the takeover bid and said that sanofi would " move quickly . "
" a friendly offer , that means it is discussed for a very long time .
to make an offer in a public , direct and open manner avoids getting caught up in a slow process which is highly likely to be submitted to all sorts of speculations , " dehecq told reporters .
aventis spurns offer aventis officially rejected sanofi 's offer on monday , calling the unsolicited bid " unacceptable . "
aventis executives are arguing that the company 's shares are undervalued and that a hostile bid battle would damage both companies .
analysts told wire services they believed aventis shareholders would demand a greater premium before accepting any deal .
but sanofi 's dehecq expressed his confidence to journalists that aventis would eventually accept a tender .
" we 're sure this offer is an attractive one and that we can convince the shareholders of aventis in the coming days , weeks and months , " he said .
government approval expected over the weekend , french authorities indicated they would greenlight a sanofi takeover of aventis , with french finance minister francis mer predicting the deal would be " largely positive . "
the french government , strongly favors the consolidation of the two pharmaceuticals , with the hope that an alliance would create a strong national company to compete with u.s. and british companies .
french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

french social affairs minister francois fillon gave a nod of approval to the bid saying he did not believe " the building of a european giant is dangerous for employment . "
employment is a particular merger concern , since together sanofi and aventis have more than 100,000 employees .
the bid was also greeted by the cosmetics firm l 'oreal and oil giant total who together own 44 percent of sanofi .
in november l 'oreal and total agreed not to extend a pact that expires at the end of 2004 that protects sanofi from predators .
this led to sanofi 's aggressive tactics to secure it 's financial future and an attempt to avoid ending up in a weak market position like aventis next year if l 'oreal and total decide to sell their sanofi holdings . lower costs , more pills according to statements made by sanofi executives , the merger would reduce costs and enable a greater amount of the expensive research required to develop new drugs and bring them to market . " sanofi-synthelabo believes that the enhanced scale , financial strength and research and development resources will allow the new group to serve patients worldwide and to enhance shareholder value in ways that are not likely to be achieved by either sanofi-sythelabo or aventis on a stand alone basis , " the company said in a statement .
sanofi said after restructuring costs estimated at around € 2 billion , the company expected € 1.6 billion euros in annual pretax savings as a result of the merger .
the combined group would have projected consolidated pre-tax sales of € 25 billion euros .
aventis stock , created following the 1999 merger of germany 's hoechst and france 's rhone-poulenc , has risen sharply in recent weeks following speculation of a merger with sanofi .
trading in both sanofi and aventis shares was suspended monday until 3 p.m.

about 8,000 downed tools at 0600 gmt monday , for the first time since 1988 .
staff have mounted picket lines outside plants in solihull , west midlands , and gaydon in warwickshire .
but land rover warned action could put the future of the solihull plant at risk as it would be " increasingly difficult " to justify new investment .
unions have warned that production will be badly hit by the 24-hour walkout .
the factory normally produces 1,000 vehicles a day , 70 % of which are exported .
it added its offer of a 6.5 % pay increase over two years was " significantly " above the rate of inflation and industry settlements in the uk .
action escalates the transport and general workers ' union said its members at land rover believed the pay offer should be increased to reflect the contribution they have made to the company 's profits .
workers voted heavily against the offer , arguing that the deal would not give them parity with employees in fellow ford-owned company jaguar .
the strike represents an escalation of industrial action , including an overtime ban in recent weeks and the withdrawal from a flexible working agreement earlier this month .
employment benefits duncan simpson , national official at amicus , said : " it 's with reluctance that we 've moved to strike action but we hope the company will rethink their position and agree to negotiations .
" we 've said we are prepared to meet the company at any time without preconditions .
" the ball is in their court . "
land rover said its workers enjoyed a comprehensive package of employment benefits that placed them at the top of the car industry pay league .

major fraud is classed as any case that goes to court where the sum involved is in excess of £ 100,000 .
some 19 cases went to court in 2003 , compared with 10 in 2002 , according to a " barometer " used by accountants kpmg .
however , although the number of cases increased , the total value of the money involved fell from £ 27.5m in 2002 , to just over £ 14m in 2003 .
do not be complacent about fraud jonathan middup one case involved a man who posed as a police offer to try and extort £ 120,000 from an exmouth widow , claiming that two men were planning to kidnap her son .
another case involved a businessman from cornwall who , along with an associate , was alleged to have claimed more than £ 1.4m in false agricultural subsidies to boost their flax business .
a spokesman for kpmg 's regional forensic unit warned companies in the south west are potentially at risk from fraud from both inside and outside the organisation .
jonathan middup said : " the barometer shows that more frauds than ever are being committed , with organisations being attacked both internally and externally .
" there are some individuals who will commit fraud if they are given the chance , and many businesses are leaving themselves open to attack by not having adequate fraud risk strategies , whistle-blowing policies or internal processes to minimise the opportunity . "
" the key message for businesses across the region is : do not be complacent about fraud .
" there are organised criminals who are actively targeting companies .
internal controls must be robust to prevent management , employees , customers or suppliers from exploiting weakness in systems .
" fraud can seriously damage not only the financial basis of a business , but also its reputation . "
in a trend matching that of the south west , the total value of fraud in the uk declined to £ 374m in 2003 , a 48 % decrease from 2002 's £ 716m .

major fraud is classed as any case that goes to court where the sum involved is in excess of £ 100,000 .
some 19 cases went to court in 2003 , compared with 10 in 2002 , according to a " barometer " used by accountants kpmg .

do not be complacent about fraud jonathan middup one case involved a man who posed as a police offer to try and extort £ 120,000 from an exmouth widow , claiming that two men were planning to kidnap her son .
another case involved a businessman from cornwall who , along with an associate , was alleged to have claimed more than £ 1.4m in false agricultural subsidies to boost their flax business .
a spokesman for kpmg 's regional forensic unit warned companies in the south west are potentially at risk from fraud from both inside and outside the organisation .
jonathan middup said : " the barometer shows that more frauds than ever are being committed , with organisations being attacked both internally and externally .
" there are some individuals who will commit fraud if they are given the chance , and many businesses are leaving themselves open to attack by not having adequate fraud risk strategies , whistle-blowing policies or internal processes to minimise the opportunity . "
" the key message for businesses across the region is : do not be complacent about fraud .
" there are organised criminals who are actively targeting companies .
internal controls must be robust to prevent management , employees , customers or suppliers from exploiting weakness in systems .
" fraud can seriously damage not only the financial basis of a business , but also its reputation . "

the ferguson-smith centre is named after the man who founded the service in 1961 to give information about conditions which run in families .
these include down 's syndrome , muscular dystrophy and some forms of cancer and heart disease .
the new centre will provide room for clinicians and patients , allowing laboratory staff to expand .
clinical staff they will be able to provide the most recent developments in genetic tests .
the yorkhill site has offered information and counselling to almost 25,000 families in the past four decades .
the service began with five members of staff including professor malcolm ferguson-smith and his wife .
the team has since expanded to more than 100 .
the new ferguson-smith centre will complement the existing duncan guthrie institute that opened in 1980 and housed both clinical and laboratory staff in the one unit .
professor mike connor , director of the west of scotland regional genetics service , said : " in the early years it was often very difficult to pinpoint who in a family might be at risk of inheriting a condition . "
yorkhill is known worldwide for its genetic services , its training programme , and its high quality research in medical genetics " professor malcolm ferguson-smith " however , new genetic tests for the many thousands of genetic conditions are becoming available each year meaning we can often find a family 's damaged gene , make an accurate diagnosis , and identify healthy people who might develop the condition in the future or pass it on .
" the new centre will enable us to work far more effectively with our patients and their families . "
professor ferguson-smith said he was honoured that the new centre was being named after him .
he said : " yorkhill is known worldwide for its genetic services , its training programme , and its high quality research in medical genetics .
" i welcome this new development , as it will provide even better access to the people who desperately need genetic services . "

and with elections at the end of this year , the bush administration wants to keep its own powerful sugar cane and sugar beet industry onside .

but the 120,000 jobs which the sugar industry provides are also crucial .
and mr howard made clear on monday that he knew that whatever the two countries ' close working relationship on defence and security , where trade was concerned " friendship does n't always amount to a lot . "
australian media have been speculating that during talks in washington dc this week , trade minister mark vaile would offer to leave sugar out of the deal .
mr vaile has dismissed the suspicion , supported by his prime minister .
" unless we get concessions on the agriculture front , the trade agreement is not worth signing , " mr howard said .
the us has been trenchant in keeping agricultural concessions out of the barrage of trade deals it has signed recently .

gervais made history by becoming the first british actor to win a tv comedy acting award at the globes .
gervais could be adding a major us award to his baftas at the same time his comic masterpiece the office became the first non-us series to win the best comedy programme category .
gervais had faced tough competition in hollywood , most notably in the shape of friends star matt leblanc .
the office , which has been lapped up by a small but loyal following on bbc america , was up against all-american thoroughbreds such as sex and city and will and grace .
gervais ' win has prompted claims of a new wave of british comedians ready to take the us by storm - if not on tv , then certainly on the stand-up circuit .
fellow comic eddie izzard has enjoyed success with his live touring show - even while poking fun at us audiences during his routine .
monty python 's flying circus was america 's first major comedy import he is part of a stable of british and irish talent packaged for us audiences that includes the league of gentlemen , bill bailey , dylan moran and boothby graffoe .
izzard said the so-called comedy gap between the two nations - especially over the contentious view that americans " do not get irony " - was just a myth .
gervais agreed : " americans do irony and ' dark ' as good as anyone , " he said .
" americans understand irony and do it as well , if not better , than us . "
benny hill became hugely popular in the us america has enjoyed an on-off love affair with british humour which began in earnest 30 years ago with monty python 's flying circus and john cleese 's fawlty towers .
python was first broadcast on us public television in the mid-1970s , and still embraces a huge cult following - especially among baby boomers .
fawlty towers was that rare thing - a british sitcom that was popular in its original format in the us , elevating cleese to even greater comic status .
risqué british comic benny hill also became a huge worldwide star and a multi-millionaire in his fifties after his titillating sketch show suddenly took off in the states .
other imports have experienced mixed success , with a string of adaptations failing to tickle the collective us funny bone .
seventies sitcom are you being served ? was turned into beane 's of boston , with a script adapted by writers jeremy lloyd and david croft , but was not picked up for a series .
til death us do part was successfully adapted for us audiences absolutely fabulous was well received , and comedienne roseanne barr bought the us rights .
but it was not adapted because the networks were reportedly unhappy about its notorious nature .
more recently the us remake of 30-something comedy coupling was removed from its prime-time tv spot after critics slated it .
one success was til death us do part starring warren mitchell as alf garnett , remade as all in the family in 1971 , which ran for nine years .
but beryl vertue , the producer who sold the garnett concept , warned it might not be that easy for gervais and the office - which is itself being remade for us audiences .
she said : " i think the office is wonderful .
but the very things that make the office work - the embarrassed silences , the pauses , the doing nothing , the lack of gags - will undermine the confidence of the networks hugely . "

the unit at robert jones and agnes hunt hospital in gobowen , near oswestry , shropshire , shut its doors in october after 22 midwives became pregnant across the county .
hospital bosses said they did try to arrange cover for the maternity leave , but failed because of a national shortage of trained staff .
the move sparked a campaign to save the ward after local people became concerned it would not reopen .
community support the head of maternity and women 's services in shropshire , sue breslin , said that was never on the cards , adding that the campaign has been very welcome .
" i do n't see it as a protest , i see it is a sign of support for the unit , " she said .
" it 's been quite heart-warming to receive so many letters of support .
" it 's a unit that we do all support and there 's never been any intention to close the unit by the back door as many people had feared . "
expectant mothers needing hospital care have been forced to travel to either wrexham , powys or shrewsbury .
a reopening date for the ward is still to be confirmed .

kent refugee action network -lrb- kran -rrb- , based in dover , said allegations made in the mail on sunday that it was using taxpayers ' money to pay for the handouts were untrue .
the charity , which has received £ 39,000 from the home office to provide a mentoring scheme for people granted refugee status , said any goods given out in calais came from voluntary donations .
its volunteers have made three trips across the channel in the past three months to give away food and clothing not needed for projects in south london and dover .
what they are doing is providing a very basic minimum of a hot snack each day to people who literally would otherwise be starving ben bano , kent refugee action network kran spokesman ben bano said : " this activity is entirely separate from the funding which kran gets for mentoring asylum seekers who have actually been successful in their applications .
" all the trips to calais , and there have actually been three in all , have been financed entirely from voluntary donations .
" in fact , the people going over to calais have paid their own fares .
" i can assure everybody that in fact government money will have gone nowhere near this particular activity . "
mr bano said the charity 's work was only a small contribution compared to the support given to the asylum seekers by similar groups in france .
" what they are doing is providing a very basic minimum of a hot snack each day to people who literally would otherwise be starving , " he said .
" we know and the asylum seekers know - the ones who are actually in calais - that there is no chance of them getting to england . "
mr bano said no more trips were planned at present because the charity had no more clothing to give away .

what they are doing is providing a very basic minimum of a hot snack each day to people who literally would otherwise be starving ben bano , kent refugee action network kran spokesman ben bano said : " this activity is entirely separate from the funding which kran gets for mentoring asylum seekers who have actually been successful in their applications .
" all the trips to calais , and there have actually been three in all , have been financed entirely from voluntary donations .
" in fact , the people going over to calais have paid their own fares .
" i can assure everybody that in fact government money will have gone nowhere near this particular activity . "
mr bano said the charity 's work was only a small contribution compared to the support given to the asylum seekers by similar groups in france .
" what they are doing is providing a very basic minimum of a hot snack each day to people who literally would otherwise be starving , " he said .
" we know and the asylum seekers know - the ones who are actually in calais - that there is no chance of them getting to england . "
mr bano said no more trips were planned at present because the charity had no more clothing to give away .
