dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .

but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .

the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .
but the seed of doubt is budding . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiations with turkey .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2004 -rrb- waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .
but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen .
-lrb- sept .
16 , 2004 -rrb- turkey changes laws to meet eu standards the turkish government agreed on 348 new paragraphs to brings it 80-year-old penal code , which punished sheep theft harder than assault , up to european standard .
extending women 's rights was especially controversial .

the arrests prompted slovene prime minister anton rop to say that he was withdrawing support for croatia ’ s bid to join the european union , according to le monde .
" unacceptable incidents like that on wednesday ... mean that slovenia – for now - can not back croatia 's accession to the eu , " rop told national radio , according to the french daily .
croatia is aiming to join the union in 2007 , along with romania and bulgaria .
the authorities in zagreb reacted angrily to slovenia ’ s announcement stating that eu membership should not be used as a tool to exert pressure .
in a foreign ministry statement , the croatian authorities described the reaction as the " inappropriate politicization , unprecedented in european union practice . "
the men held were released after over five hours in detention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc romania gets ambitious over eu entry the free movement of services and regional policy chapters were closed thursday .
in addition , half of the environment chapter has been closed , which leaves the competition and justice and home affairs files to be closed by the end of october , as well as the other half of the environment chapter .
romania wants to conclude all talks during the term of the current prodi commission .
if that happens , the eu summit in december should mark the end of the political talks with the country , prior to the accession .
a common romanian accession treaty could then be signed together with bulgaria in early spring 2005 and accession should take place in 2007 .
however , if romania does not achieve this goal , bulgaria , which closed talks with the eu last june , is likely to sign the accession treaty alone .
speaking to the european press last week in bucharest , foreign minister mircea geoana said : " i want romania to be the new spain of the eu , " meaning a country once coping with reforms which has now become a successful eu member state .
geoana added that the exact calendar of the negotiations or the signature of the accession treaty preoccupies him less than the urge to prepare the country for a good accession .
" the real motivation for the country is to know how well prepared we are when we join , " he stated .

as part of a major reform plan , there has been talk of expanding the council to 24 members , and upping the number of permanent seats , which allow veto privileges . " the united kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the security council to 24 members , " said straw , with germany , japan , brazil and india holding the new permanent seats . in arguing for the enlargement on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . germany should focus on europe , not world not all agree .
italy said that while the number of non-permanent seats on the council should increase , the five wwii victors should be the only ones allowed a permanent position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the country is overextending its diplomatic responsibility . " it 's not in germany 's interest to take part in every important decision over war and peace and then have to be responsible for the consequences , " he wrote in the mass daily bild . instead , wrote schmidt , the country should do all it can to focus on building a stronger and more cohesive european union , facing a major political challenge in the coming years in integrating 10 additional members into its membership lists . the united states has so far reacted to germany 's ambitions with silence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church needs to expose the violence against girls and women for this reason , the church had a responsibility to closely examine this issue .
“ there are theological roots to violence against women and girls , which we have to work out and expose in order to overcome this violence , ” schlarp said .
the church setting also served another purpose .
“ we want to use public space and reach people who would normally not visit an exhibit on this issue , ” mathieu said .
past venues have included city halls , vocational schools and museums .
leaving a deeper mark political support for battling sexual abuse is not lacking .
one of the exhibit 's patrons , renate augstein from the federal ministry for women and youth , said the government is very active through campaigns and education measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike pich 's untitled work illustrates how sexual abuse shatters childhood " there is a lot of material on this topic , so that is not the weak point , " she said .
" but i 've often experienced that paper is gladly accepted , but rarely read , " said augstein .
" for the most part , it ca n't leave a deeper mark . "
art , on the other hand , can do this .
" this is why an artistic debate on sexual violence is so important , " she said .
statistics and facts alone can not present a complete picture of what sexual abuse entails .
the artists and organizers hope that through the artwork , people will see the effects of sexual abuse more clearly and do more to reduce its occurrence . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focused on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

while german states seek power to regulate their relatively conservative shop opening hours , most other eu countries have already adopted liberal laws . german states passed a motion in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , on friday to give themselves power to regulate retail opening hours .
most of the country 's 16 states want to do away with all barriers to weekday trading hours .
if the motion passes the lower house of parliament , germany could soon join the ranks of eu countries who long ago adopted a more liberal stance on shopping hours .
only austria and italy take after germany in their restrictive regulations on opening times .
strict regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in a department store in bremen details the opening hours .
in austria , stores are allowed to open from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays .
on saturdays shops must close by 6 p.m. at the latest .
however , tourist areas may extend opening hours from 66 to a maximum of 72 hour per week .
as in germany , regional exceptions aside , stores are prohibited from opening on sundays and public holidays .
in italy , stores close at 10 p.m. on weekdays and at 9 p.m. on saturdays .
italian law also prohibits sunday shopping , except in regions that rely heavily on tourism .
sunday remains sacrosanct greece , denmark , the netherlands and spain have also decided against shopping on sundays and public holidays .
but when it comes to weekday regulations , these countries are far more liberal than germany .
greek shop owners enjoy unlimited opening hours from monday to saturday .
only on saturdays do shops in denmark have to close by 5 p.m. while in the netherlands , stores can open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. six days a week .
shopping til you drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : browsing for music is a favorite sunday pastime in some eu countries store hours are generally unlimited in france , where shop owners have the freedom to decide over opening hours .
customers can also shop on sundays and on public holidays .
however , there are certain restrictions in place for the protection of staff members .
belgium abides by similar regulations .
the british and the irish , however , can shop till they drop .
only on sundays are opening hours limited in favor of smaller retailers .
in poland , there are no restrictions on opening hours .
swedish and portuguese shop owners also enjoy more liberal opening hours , although they are required to close their shops after midnight on saturdays . martin boosen -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer .

" addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution . " italy rejects german bid italy on thursday meanwhile spoke out strongly against germany 's hopes for a permanent seat on the council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " some member states have advocated the addition of new permanent seats - for themselves , " italian foreign minister franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a speech to the un general assembly without mentioning germany by name . " we do not believe the council 's difficulties can be resolved through new permanent , irrevocable appointments and national mandates , " he said shortly after fischer had made his case . " italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .
" we are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue such a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats . " but according to news reports , a majority of eu member states supports the german call for a permanent seat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sets sights on permanent un seat as the 59th united nations general assembly considers structural reforms , germany has made no secret of its interest in joining the enlarged security council as a permanent member .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church needs to expose the violence against girls and women for this reason , the church had a responsibility to closely examine this issue .
“ there are theological roots to violence against women and girls , which we have to work out and expose in order to overcome this violence , ” schlarp said .
the church setting also served another purpose .
“ we want to use public space and reach people who would normally not visit an exhibit on this issue , ” mathieu said .
past venues have included city halls , vocational schools and museums .
leaving a deeper mark political support for battling sexual abuse is not lacking .
one of the exhibit 's patrons , renate augstein from the federal ministry for women and youth , said the government is very active through campaigns and education measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike pich 's untitled work illustrates how sexual abuse shatters childhood " there is a lot of material on this topic , so that is not the weak point , " she said .
" but i 've often experienced that paper is gladly accepted , but rarely read , " said augstein .
" for the most part , it ca n't leave a deeper mark . "
art , on the other hand , can do this .
" this is why an artistic debate on sexual violence is so important , " she said .
statistics and facts alone can not present a complete picture of what sexual abuse entails .
the artists and organizers hope that through the artwork , people will see the effects of sexual abuse more clearly and do more to reduce its occurrence . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focused on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .
but the seed of doubt is budding . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiations with turkey .

" addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution . " italy rejects german bid italy on thursday meanwhile spoke out strongly against germany 's hopes for a permanent seat on the council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " some member states have advocated the addition of new permanent seats - for themselves , " italian foreign minister franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a speech to the un general assembly without mentioning germany by name . " we do not believe the council 's difficulties can be resolved through new permanent , irrevocable appointments and national mandates , " he said shortly after fischer had made his case . " italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .
" we are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue such a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats . " but according to news reports , a majority of eu member states supports the german call for a permanent seat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sets sights on permanent un seat as the 59th united nations general assembly considers structural reforms , germany has made no secret of its interest in joining the enlarged security council as a permanent member .

" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .

" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .

the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .

as part of a major reform plan , there has been talk of expanding the council to 24 members , and upping the number of permanent seats , which allow veto privileges . " the united kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the security council to 24 members , " said straw , with germany , japan , brazil and india holding the new permanent seats . in arguing for the enlargement on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . germany should focus on europe , not world not all agree .
italy said that while the number of non-permanent seats on the council should increase , the five wwii victors should be the only ones allowed a permanent position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the country is overextending its diplomatic responsibility . " it 's not in germany 's interest to take part in every important decision over war and peace and then have to be responsible for the consequences , " he wrote in the mass daily bild . instead , wrote schmidt , the country should do all it can to focus on building a stronger and more cohesive european union , facing a major political challenge in the coming years in integrating 10 additional members into its membership lists . the united states has so far reacted to germany 's ambitions with silence .
us secretary of state colin powell said washington would wait until the reform commission brought together by secretary-general kofi annan issued its report , expected in december . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers " committed contribution " in a speech at the un general assembly on thursday , german foreign minister fischer pushed for a permanent seat on the security council , saying germany was " ready to take on the responsibility .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc romania gets ambitious over eu entry the free movement of services and regional policy chapters were closed thursday .
in addition , half of the environment chapter has been closed , which leaves the competition and justice and home affairs files to be closed by the end of october , as well as the other half of the environment chapter .
romania wants to conclude all talks during the term of the current prodi commission .
if that happens , the eu summit in december should mark the end of the political talks with the country , prior to the accession .
a common romanian accession treaty could then be signed together with bulgaria in early spring 2005 and accession should take place in 2007 .
however , if romania does not achieve this goal , bulgaria , which closed talks with the eu last june , is likely to sign the accession treaty alone .
speaking to the european press last week in bucharest , foreign minister mircea geoana said : " i want romania to be the new spain of the eu , " meaning a country once coping with reforms which has now become a successful eu member state .
geoana added that the exact calendar of the negotiations or the signature of the accession treaty preoccupies him less than the urge to prepare the country for a good accession .
" the real motivation for the country is to know how well prepared we are when we join , " he stated .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .

he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .

but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 transplant laws under microscope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science , not wealth , should decide who receives transplant surgery facing a growing list of patients in desperate need of an organ transplant , germany 's ethics council met to discuss ways of loosening the country 's strict transplant laws .
the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .
but the seed of doubt is budding . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiations with turkey .

23 , 2004 -rrb- waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .
but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen .

" the united kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the security council to 24 members , " said straw , with germany , japan , brazil and india holding the new permanent seats . in arguing for the enlargement on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . germany should focus on europe , not world not all agree .
italy said that while the number of non-permanent seats on the council should increase , the five wwii victors should be the only ones allowed a permanent position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the country is overextending its diplomatic responsibility .

a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .
but the seed of doubt is budding . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiations with turkey .

while german states seek power to regulate their relatively conservative shop opening hours , most other eu countries have already adopted liberal laws . german states passed a motion in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , on friday to give themselves power to regulate retail opening hours .

as part of a major reform plan , there has been talk of expanding the council to 24 members , and upping the number of permanent seats , which allow veto privileges . " the united kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the security council to 24 members , " said straw , with germany , japan , brazil and india holding the new permanent seats . in arguing for the enlargement on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . germany should focus on europe , not world not all agree .
italy said that while the number of non-permanent seats on the council should increase , the five wwii victors should be the only ones allowed a permanent position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the country is overextending its diplomatic responsibility . " it 's not in germany 's interest to take part in every important decision over war and peace and then have to be responsible for the consequences , " he wrote in the mass daily bild . instead , wrote schmidt , the country should do all it can to focus on building a stronger and more cohesive european union , facing a major political challenge in the coming years in integrating 10 additional members into its membership lists . the united states has so far reacted to germany 's ambitions with silence .
us secretary of state colin powell said washington would wait until the reform commission brought together by secretary-general kofi annan issued its report , expected in december . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers " committed contribution " in a speech at the un general assembly on thursday , german foreign minister fischer pushed for a permanent seat on the security council , saying germany was " ready to take on the responsibility .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .
but the seed of doubt is budding . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiations with turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church needs to expose the violence against girls and women for this reason , the church had a responsibility to closely examine this issue .
“ there are theological roots to violence against women and girls , which we have to work out and expose in order to overcome this violence , ” schlarp said .
the church setting also served another purpose .
“ we want to use public space and reach people who would normally not visit an exhibit on this issue , ” mathieu said .
past venues have included city halls , vocational schools and museums .
leaving a deeper mark political support for battling sexual abuse is not lacking .
one of the exhibit 's patrons , renate augstein from the federal ministry for women and youth , said the government is very active through campaigns and education measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike pich 's untitled work illustrates how sexual abuse shatters childhood " there is a lot of material on this topic , so that is not the weak point , " she said .
" but i 've often experienced that paper is gladly accepted , but rarely read , " said augstein .
" for the most part , it ca n't leave a deeper mark . "
art , on the other hand , can do this .
" this is why an artistic debate on sexual violence is so important , " she said .
statistics and facts alone can not present a complete picture of what sexual abuse entails .
the artists and organizers hope that through the artwork , people will see the effects of sexual abuse more clearly and do more to reduce its occurrence . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focused on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .

he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2004 opinion : a budding seed of doubt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey : the new star on the european horizon ?
nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .
but the seed of doubt is budding . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiations with turkey .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2004 -rrb- waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .
but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen .
-lrb- sept .

dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .

serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church needs to expose the violence against girls and women for this reason , the church had a responsibility to closely examine this issue .
“ there are theological roots to violence against women and girls , which we have to work out and expose in order to overcome this violence , ” schlarp said .
the church setting also served another purpose .
“ we want to use public space and reach people who would normally not visit an exhibit on this issue , ” mathieu said .
past venues have included city halls , vocational schools and museums .
leaving a deeper mark political support for battling sexual abuse is not lacking .
one of the exhibit 's patrons , renate augstein from the federal ministry for women and youth , said the government is very active through campaigns and education measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike pich 's untitled work illustrates how sexual abuse shatters childhood " there is a lot of material on this topic , so that is not the weak point , " she said .
" but i 've often experienced that paper is gladly accepted , but rarely read , " said augstein .
" for the most part , it ca n't leave a deeper mark . "
art , on the other hand , can do this .
" this is why an artistic debate on sexual violence is so important , " she said .
statistics and facts alone can not present a complete picture of what sexual abuse entails .
the artists and organizers hope that through the artwork , people will see the effects of sexual abuse more clearly and do more to reduce its occurrence . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focused on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

" addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .

those chosen then posed according to their fields of study : a psychology student was photographed sitting on a -lrb- freudian -rrb- sofa , a historical preservation major cleaned an old building block with a brush . the group even found a local company to sponsor the calendar , which is being sold for € 15 -lrb- $ 18.50 -rrb- apiece . " that 's a very good price , especially if you consider that the caldendar has 15 months , " limberger said , adding that each page had a woman on one side and a man on the other . " that way there wo n't be any fighting in co-ed student apartments because people can alternate the pictures every couple of days , " she said . beneficiaries take offense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamberg university students of historical preservation posing for the controversial calendar .
if the entire edition is sold , limberger and the others will collect € 15,000 , and it 's likely to happen as there has already been enormous interest from buyers , limberger said . but the university said it will refuse any donations coming from the project . " we have enough people here that find this offensive , " monica fröhlich , the university 's spokeswoman , told dw-world . she added that university officials felt they could not accept money that came from a project that commercialized the naked human body .
fröhlich said university officials did n't want to be connected with the project in case any of the models experienced problems as a result of having posed nude . limberger did n't want to comment on the university 's decision , but said that her group had already thought about different ways to use the money . " we 're planning to offer workshops on time management , soft skills and other subjects that help prepare students for the work place , " she said .
while subsidized , the workshops wo n't be completely free of charge . " we want to make sure that people really want to participate , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees for german students ?

while german states seek power to regulate their relatively conservative shop opening hours , most other eu countries have already adopted liberal laws . german states passed a motion in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , on friday to give themselves power to regulate retail opening hours .
most of the country 's 16 states want to do away with all barriers to weekday trading hours .
if the motion passes the lower house of parliament , germany could soon join the ranks of eu countries who long ago adopted a more liberal stance on shopping hours .
only austria and italy take after germany in their restrictive regulations on opening times .
strict regulations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in a department store in bremen details the opening hours .
in austria , stores are allowed to open from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays .
on saturdays shops must close by 6 p.m. at the latest .
however , tourist areas may extend opening hours from 66 to a maximum of 72 hour per week .
as in germany , regional exceptions aside , stores are prohibited from opening on sundays and public holidays .
in italy , stores close at 10 p.m. on weekdays and at 9 p.m. on saturdays .
italian law also prohibits sunday shopping , except in regions that rely heavily on tourism .
sunday remains sacrosanct greece , denmark , the netherlands and spain have also decided against shopping on sundays and public holidays .
but when it comes to weekday regulations , these countries are far more liberal than germany .
greek shop owners enjoy unlimited opening hours from monday to saturday .
only on saturdays do shops in denmark have to close by 5 p.m. while in the netherlands , stores can open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. six days a week .
shopping til you drop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : browsing for music is a favorite sunday pastime in some eu countries store hours are generally unlimited in france , where shop owners have the freedom to decide over opening hours .
customers can also shop on sundays and on public holidays .
however , there are certain restrictions in place for the protection of staff members .
belgium abides by similar regulations .
the british and the irish , however , can shop till they drop .
only on sundays are opening hours limited in favor of smaller retailers .
in poland , there are no restrictions on opening hours .
swedish and portuguese shop owners also enjoy more liberal opening hours , although they are required to close their shops after midnight on saturdays . martin boosen -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : restrictive german store hours obsolete german editorialists commented on a failed attempt to overturn the law restricting shopping hours to 8 p.m. in germany as well as the sentencing of three young men for ritually abusing a peer .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

the man , identified only as helmut r. , who has since been released , is suspected of brokering a deal in january 2003 for the supply of equipment used for handling spent fuel rods and separating plutonium .
" these are required parts of a military nuclear program , " prosecutors said in a statement .
they said that the man 's efforts to supply iran with the equipment led them to believe he was working as a spy against germany 's interests .
the 53-year-old man from friedrichshafen told the associated press news agency he had n't done anything illegal .
he said he had informed german officials in advance of the intended sale , but they did n't approve it .
in may , a german businessman was jailed for four years for attempting to ship aluminum tubes to north korea for possible use in its nuclear weapons program . more briefs 24.09.2004 -pipe- upper house rejects daycare bill 23.09.2004 -pipe- fake beer coupon scandal rocks oktoberfest 23.09.2004 -pipe- palace of the republic to stay open to public 23.09.2004 -pipe- flick protesters get hands-on 22.09.2004 -pipe- library fire destroyed 50,000 books 22.09.2004 -pipe- report : germans in kosovo ill-prepared 22.09.2004 -pipe- thousands evacuated after wwii bomb find 22.09.2004 -pipe- germany mulls extending afghan mission radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .

german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "

" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 cologne hosts anti-spam congress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam-busters if your e-mail address is on the internet , then chances are you 're getting spam offering penis extensions , porn and potency pills .
what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .

as part of a major reform plan , there has been talk of expanding the council to 24 members , and upping the number of permanent seats , which allow veto privileges . " the united kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the security council to 24 members , " said straw , with germany , japan , brazil and india holding the new permanent seats . in arguing for the enlargement on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . germany should focus on europe , not world not all agree .
italy said that while the number of non-permanent seats on the council should increase , the five wwii victors should be the only ones allowed a permanent position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the country is overextending its diplomatic responsibility . " it 's not in germany 's interest to take part in every important decision over war and peace and then have to be responsible for the consequences , " he wrote in the mass daily bild . instead , wrote schmidt , the country should do all it can to focus on building a stronger and more cohesive european union , facing a major political challenge in the coming years in integrating 10 additional members into its membership lists . the united states has so far reacted to germany 's ambitions with silence .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .

joining in protests against proposed university funding cuts was one option , but the bamberg students came up with a different way to raise extra cash for education . " instead of going out on the streets and throwing stones , we thought we 'd do this in a nice , beautiful way , " birgit limberger , one of the students who helped produce the calender , told dw-world . limberger and her colleagues advertised the project on a student web site and selected 28 students for photo shoots . personality counts " they did n't have to be supermodels , they just had to have a good body , " she said , adding that the major selection criteria included personality , charisma and a current university enrolment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two students from the psychology faculty of bamberg university strike a freudian pose .
those chosen then posed according to their fields of study : a psychology student was photographed sitting on a -lrb- freudian -rrb- sofa , a historical preservation major cleaned an old building block with a brush . the group even found a local company to sponsor the calendar , which is being sold for € 15 -lrb- $ 18.50 -rrb- apiece . " that 's a very good price , especially if you consider that the caldendar has 15 months , " limberger said , adding that each page had a woman on one side and a man on the other .

if the entire edition is sold , limberger and the others will collect € 15,000 , and it 's likely to happen as there has already been enormous interest from buyers , limberger said . but the university said it will refuse any donations coming from the project . " we have enough people here that find this offensive , " monica fröhlich , the university 's spokeswoman , told dw-world . she added that university officials felt they could not accept money that came from a project that commercialized the naked human body .
fröhlich said university officials did n't want to be connected with the project in case any of the models experienced problems as a result of having posed nude . limberger did n't want to comment on the university 's decision , but said that her group had already thought about different ways to use the money . " we 're planning to offer workshops on time management , soft skills and other subjects that help prepare students for the work place , " she said .
while subsidized , the workshops wo n't be completely free of charge . " we want to make sure that people really want to participate , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees for german students ?

but university officials were not amused and have turned down any donations from the project . well aware of the financial problems universities are facing at the moment , students at bamberg university in northern bavaria decided to do their part in drawing attention to the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protested against proposed university fees .
joining in protests against proposed university funding cuts was one option , but the bamberg students came up with a different way to raise extra cash for education . " instead of going out on the streets and throwing stones , we thought we 'd do this in a nice , beautiful way , " birgit limberger , one of the students who helped produce the calender , told dw-world . limberger and her colleagues advertised the project on a student web site and selected 28 students for photo shoots . personality counts " they did n't have to be supermodels , they just had to have a good body , " she said , adding that the major selection criteria included personality , charisma and a current university enrolment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two students from the psychology faculty of bamberg university strike a freudian pose .
those chosen then posed according to their fields of study : a psychology student was photographed sitting on a -lrb- freudian -rrb- sofa , a historical preservation major cleaned an old building block with a brush . the group even found a local company to sponsor the calendar , which is being sold for € 15 -lrb- $ 18.50 -rrb- apiece . " that 's a very good price , especially if you consider that the caldendar has 15 months , " limberger said , adding that each page had a woman on one side and a man on the other . " that way there wo n't be any fighting in co-ed student apartments because people can alternate the pictures every couple of days , " she said . beneficiaries take offense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamberg university students of historical preservation posing for the controversial calendar .
if the entire edition is sold , limberger and the others will collect € 15,000 , and it 's likely to happen as there has already been enormous interest from buyers , limberger said . but the university said it will refuse any donations coming from the project . " we have enough people here that find this offensive , " monica fröhlich , the university 's spokeswoman , told dw-world . she added that university officials felt they could not accept money that came from a project that commercialized the naked human body .
fröhlich said university officials did n't want to be connected with the project in case any of the models experienced problems as a result of having posed nude . limberger did n't want to comment on the university 's decision , but said that her group had already thought about different ways to use the money . " we 're planning to offer workshops on time management , soft skills and other subjects that help prepare students for the work place , " she said .
while subsidized , the workshops wo n't be completely free of charge . " we want to make sure that people really want to participate , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees for german students ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 germany offers " committed contribution " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said the security council had to reflect the global reality in a speech at the un general assembly on thursday , german foreign minister fischer pushed for a permanent seat on the security council , saying germany was " ready to take on the responsibility . " addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution . " italy rejects german bid italy on thursday meanwhile spoke out strongly against germany 's hopes for a permanent seat on the council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " some member states have advocated the addition of new permanent seats - for themselves , " italian foreign minister franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a speech to the un general assembly without mentioning germany by name . " we do not believe the council 's difficulties can be resolved through new permanent , irrevocable appointments and national mandates , " he said shortly after fischer had made his case . " italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .
" we are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue such a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats . " but according to news reports , a majority of eu member states supports the german call for a permanent seat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sets sights on permanent un seat as the 59th united nations general assembly considers structural reforms , germany has made no secret of its interest in joining the enlarged security council as a permanent member .

" addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution . " italy rejects german bid italy on thursday meanwhile spoke out strongly against germany 's hopes for a permanent seat on the council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " some member states have advocated the addition of new permanent seats - for themselves , " italian foreign minister franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a speech to the un general assembly without mentioning germany by name . " we do not believe the council 's difficulties can be resolved through new permanent , irrevocable appointments and national mandates , " he said shortly after fischer had made his case . " italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .
" we are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue such a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats . " but according to news reports , a majority of eu member states supports the german call for a permanent seat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sets sights on permanent un seat as the 59th united nations general assembly considers structural reforms , germany has made no secret of its interest in joining the enlarged security council as a permanent member .

but university officials were not amused and have turned down any donations from the project . well aware of the financial problems universities are facing at the moment , students at bamberg university in northern bavaria decided to do their part in drawing attention to the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protested against proposed university fees .
joining in protests against proposed university funding cuts was one option , but the bamberg students came up with a different way to raise extra cash for education . " instead of going out on the streets and throwing stones , we thought we 'd do this in a nice , beautiful way , " birgit limberger , one of the students who helped produce the calender , told dw-world . limberger and her colleagues advertised the project on a student web site and selected 28 students for photo shoots . personality counts " they did n't have to be supermodels , they just had to have a good body , " she said , adding that the major selection criteria included personality , charisma and a current university enrolment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two students from the psychology faculty of bamberg university strike a freudian pose .
those chosen then posed according to their fields of study : a psychology student was photographed sitting on a -lrb- freudian -rrb- sofa , a historical preservation major cleaned an old building block with a brush . the group even found a local company to sponsor the calendar , which is being sold for € 15 -lrb- $ 18.50 -rrb- apiece . " that 's a very good price , especially if you consider that the caldendar has 15 months , " limberger said , adding that each page had a woman on one side and a man on the other . " that way there wo n't be any fighting in co-ed student apartments because people can alternate the pictures every couple of days , " she said . beneficiaries take offense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamberg university students of historical preservation posing for the controversial calendar .
if the entire edition is sold , limberger and the others will collect € 15,000 , and it 's likely to happen as there has already been enormous interest from buyers , limberger said . but the university said it will refuse any donations coming from the project . " we have enough people here that find this offensive , " monica fröhlich , the university 's spokeswoman , told dw-world . she added that university officials felt they could not accept money that came from a project that commercialized the naked human body .
fröhlich said university officials did n't want to be connected with the project in case any of the models experienced problems as a result of having posed nude . limberger did n't want to comment on the university 's decision , but said that her group had already thought about different ways to use the money . " we 're planning to offer workshops on time management , soft skills and other subjects that help prepare students for the work place , " she said .
while subsidized , the workshops wo n't be completely free of charge . " we want to make sure that people really want to participate , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees for german students ?

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .

serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .

the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .

" addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution . " italy rejects german bid italy on thursday meanwhile spoke out strongly against germany 's hopes for a permanent seat on the council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " some member states have advocated the addition of new permanent seats - for themselves , " italian foreign minister franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a speech to the un general assembly without mentioning germany by name . " we do not believe the council 's difficulties can be resolved through new permanent , irrevocable appointments and national mandates , " he said shortly after fischer had made his case . " italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .
" we are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue such a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats . " but according to news reports , a majority of eu member states supports the german call for a permanent seat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sets sights on permanent un seat as the 59th united nations general assembly considers structural reforms , germany has made no secret of its interest in joining the enlarged security council as a permanent member .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2004 the chancellor 's long road back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't been the most popular guy in germany chancellor gerhard schröder has come up to the halftime of his second term as the country 's leader .
the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

as part of a major reform plan , there has been talk of expanding the council to 24 members , and upping the number of permanent seats , which allow veto privileges . " the united kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the security council to 24 members , " said straw , with germany , japan , brazil and india holding the new permanent seats . in arguing for the enlargement on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . germany should focus on europe , not world not all agree .
italy said that while the number of non-permanent seats on the council should increase , the five wwii victors should be the only ones allowed a permanent position . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed , saying the country is overextending its diplomatic responsibility . " it 's not in germany 's interest to take part in every important decision over war and peace and then have to be responsible for the consequences , " he wrote in the mass daily bild . instead , wrote schmidt , the country should do all it can to focus on building a stronger and more cohesive european union , facing a major political challenge in the coming years in integrating 10 additional members into its membership lists . the united states has so far reacted to germany 's ambitions with silence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 germany offers " committed contribution " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said the security council had to reflect the global reality in a speech at the un general assembly on thursday , german foreign minister fischer pushed for a permanent seat on the security council , saying germany was " ready to take on the responsibility . " addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution .

" if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution . " italy rejects german bid italy on thursday meanwhile spoke out strongly against germany 's hopes for a permanent seat on the council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " some member states have advocated the addition of new permanent seats - for themselves , " italian foreign minister franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a speech to the un general assembly without mentioning germany by name . " we do not believe the council 's difficulties can be resolved through new permanent , irrevocable appointments and national mandates , " he said shortly after fischer had made his case . " italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .
" we are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue such a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats . " but according to news reports , a majority of eu member states supports the german call for a permanent seat . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sets sights on permanent un seat as the 59th united nations general assembly considers structural reforms , germany has made no secret of its interest in joining the enlarged security council as a permanent member .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

" the united kingdom has long supported the case for expanding the security council to 24 members , " said straw , with germany , japan , brazil and india holding the new permanent seats . in arguing for the enlargement on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . germany should focus on europe , not world not all agree .

" it 's not in germany 's interest to take part in every important decision over war and peace and then have to be responsible for the consequences , " he wrote in the mass daily bild . instead , wrote schmidt , the country should do all it can to focus on building a stronger and more cohesive european union , facing a major political challenge in the coming years in integrating 10 additional members into its membership lists . the united states has so far reacted to germany 's ambitions with silence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 germany offers " committed contribution " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer said the security council had to reflect the global reality in a speech at the un general assembly on thursday , german foreign minister fischer pushed for a permanent seat on the security council , saying germany was " ready to take on the responsibility . " addressing representatives of the 191 un member states at the united nations general assembly in new york on thursday , german foreign minister joschka fischer underlined the need to reform the security council . " if we really want the decision of the security council to be accepted as legitimate and effectively implemented , we have to reform the council , " fischer said . reform of the security council , which currently has 15 members , five of them permanent -lrb- us , britain , france , russia and china -rrb- , has been debated for years .
un secretary-general kofi annan has set up an expert commission to propose changes . the german foreign minister also named india , brazil and japan as the three other nations that like germany are trying to get permanent seats on the security council . " just like them , germany is ready to take on the responsibility associated with a permanent seat in the security council , " fischer said . adapting to " new global reality " fischer justified the demand by saying that a council with more members would enjoy greater acceptance internationally as a basis for greater authority . he added that an enlarged council would lead all nations to better identify with the council and would bolster the motivation of the new members to make a long-term contribution to realizing un goals . " it 's high time to adapt the security council to the new global reality , " fischer said .
" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2004 opinion : a budding seed of doubt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey : the new star on the european horizon ?
nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 cologne hosts anti-spam congress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam-busters if your e-mail address is on the internet , then chances are you 're getting spam offering penis extensions , porn and potency pills .
what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .

schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2004 opinion : a budding seed of doubt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey : the new star on the european horizon ?
nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .
he even questioned the european capabilities of the entire turkish society , which had not sufficiently internalized the division of church and state , he said . the seed of doubt but wanting to catch up on a fundamental discussion just a few weeks before the crucial resolution is virtually impossible .
the decision to accept turkey into the eu at some point was already made back in 1999 . now , it 's just a matter of negotiating conditions and time frames . five years ago , the european heads of state shirked a fundamental debate on turkey , europe 's borders , religion and culture , said luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who was there at the time . the outer peace between the eu and turkey has been re-established after the crisis meeting in brussels .
but the seed of doubt is budding . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiations with turkey .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2004 -rrb- waiting for eu many members of the turkish-german community are n't exactly sure what turkey 's membership in the eu would mean for them personally .
but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen .
-lrb- sept .

" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .

we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .

" italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .

" it is also especially important that the african continent be represented among the new permanent members . " fischer further said that an expansion " must adequately reflect sea changes such as decolonization , the end of the cold war and globalization .
the composition of the council must ultimately mirror the current geopolitical reality . " a rethink on the working of the un fischer also said he was in favor of reforming the individual organizations subordinate to the un and pleaded for a rethink on the working of the general assembly . " the general assembly has to be more than an annual forum where we just go through the motions , " fischer said .
" what we need to do firstly is focus our topics more carefully .
we have to discuss the truly crucial issues . " fischer also warned that the un had to brace it for more , not less , conflicts in the world in the future and the demands on the organization were bound to grow . " against this backdrop , the question arises whether the structures of given to the united nations on its foundation almost 60 years ago are still suited to this mandate , whether its work enjoys the international acceptance it needs , " fischer said .
" in particular the disputes concerning the iraq crisis highlighted this problem again . " " we , the member states , have to muster the political insight , the will and the creativity to adapt the organization to the global reality , " fischer said .
" germany is ready to make a committed contribution . " italy rejects german bid italy on thursday meanwhile spoke out strongly against germany 's hopes for a permanent seat on the council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " some member states have advocated the addition of new permanent seats - for themselves , " italian foreign minister franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a speech to the un general assembly without mentioning germany by name . " we do not believe the council 's difficulties can be resolved through new permanent , irrevocable appointments and national mandates , " he said shortly after fischer had made his case . " italy is in favour of a security council reform inspired by the principles of greater inclusiveness , effectiveness , democratic participation and geographic representation , starting with developing countries , " frattini said .
" we are firmly convinced that the best way to pursue such a reform is to establish new non-permanent seats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church needs to expose the violence against girls and women for this reason , the church had a responsibility to closely examine this issue .
“ there are theological roots to violence against women and girls , which we have to work out and expose in order to overcome this violence , ” schlarp said .
the church setting also served another purpose .
“ we want to use public space and reach people who would normally not visit an exhibit on this issue , ” mathieu said .
past venues have included city halls , vocational schools and museums .
leaving a deeper mark political support for battling sexual abuse is not lacking .
one of the exhibit 's patrons , renate augstein from the federal ministry for women and youth , said the government is very active through campaigns and education measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike pich 's untitled work illustrates how sexual abuse shatters childhood " there is a lot of material on this topic , so that is not the weak point , " she said .
" but i 've often experienced that paper is gladly accepted , but rarely read , " said augstein .
" for the most part , it ca n't leave a deeper mark . "
art , on the other hand , can do this .
" this is why an artistic debate on sexual violence is so important , " she said .
statistics and facts alone can not present a complete picture of what sexual abuse entails .
the artists and organizers hope that through the artwork , people will see the effects of sexual abuse more clearly and do more to reduce its occurrence . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focused on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .

" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church needs to expose the violence against girls and women for this reason , the church had a responsibility to closely examine this issue .
“ there are theological roots to violence against women and girls , which we have to work out and expose in order to overcome this violence , ” schlarp said .
the church setting also served another purpose .
“ we want to use public space and reach people who would normally not visit an exhibit on this issue , ” mathieu said .
past venues have included city halls , vocational schools and museums .
leaving a deeper mark political support for battling sexual abuse is not lacking .
one of the exhibit 's patrons , renate augstein from the federal ministry for women and youth , said the government is very active through campaigns and education measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike pich 's untitled work illustrates how sexual abuse shatters childhood " there is a lot of material on this topic , so that is not the weak point , " she said .
" but i 've often experienced that paper is gladly accepted , but rarely read , " said augstein .
" for the most part , it ca n't leave a deeper mark . "
art , on the other hand , can do this .
" this is why an artistic debate on sexual violence is so important , " she said .
statistics and facts alone can not present a complete picture of what sexual abuse entails .
the artists and organizers hope that through the artwork , people will see the effects of sexual abuse more clearly and do more to reduce its occurrence . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focused on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 cologne hosts anti-spam congress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam-busters if your e-mail address is on the internet , then chances are you 're getting spam offering penis extensions , porn and potency pills .
what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .
a european union ban comes into effect on oct .

dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .

but university officials were not amused and have turned down any donations from the project . well aware of the financial problems universities are facing at the moment , students at bamberg university in northern bavaria decided to do their part in drawing attention to the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in frankfurt protested against proposed university fees .
joining in protests against proposed university funding cuts was one option , but the bamberg students came up with a different way to raise extra cash for education . " instead of going out on the streets and throwing stones , we thought we 'd do this in a nice , beautiful way , " birgit limberger , one of the students who helped produce the calender , told dw-world . limberger and her colleagues advertised the project on a student web site and selected 28 students for photo shoots . personality counts " they did n't have to be supermodels , they just had to have a good body , " she said , adding that the major selection criteria included personality , charisma and a current university enrolment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two students from the psychology faculty of bamberg university strike a freudian pose .
those chosen then posed according to their fields of study : a psychology student was photographed sitting on a -lrb- freudian -rrb- sofa , a historical preservation major cleaned an old building block with a brush . the group even found a local company to sponsor the calendar , which is being sold for € 15 -lrb- $ 18.50 -rrb- apiece . " that 's a very good price , especially if you consider that the caldendar has 15 months , " limberger said , adding that each page had a woman on one side and a man on the other . " that way there wo n't be any fighting in co-ed student apartments because people can alternate the pictures every couple of days , " she said . beneficiaries take offense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bamberg university students of historical preservation posing for the controversial calendar .
if the entire edition is sold , limberger and the others will collect € 15,000 , and it 's likely to happen as there has already been enormous interest from buyers , limberger said . but the university said it will refuse any donations coming from the project . " we have enough people here that find this offensive , " monica fröhlich , the university 's spokeswoman , told dw-world . she added that university officials felt they could not accept money that came from a project that commercialized the naked human body .
fröhlich said university officials did n't want to be connected with the project in case any of the models experienced problems as a result of having posed nude . limberger did n't want to comment on the university 's decision , but said that her group had already thought about different ways to use the money . " we 're planning to offer workshops on time management , soft skills and other subjects that help prepare students for the work place , " she said .
while subsidized , the workshops wo n't be completely free of charge . " we want to make sure that people really want to participate , " she said . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees for german students ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 transplant laws under microscope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science , not wealth , should decide who receives transplant surgery facing a growing list of patients in desperate need of an organ transplant , germany 's ethics council met to discuss ways of loosening the country 's strict transplant laws .
the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "

the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .
candidates will most likely drop 5-6 percentage points compared to the last elections .
the difference wo n't be made up by schröder 's spd , but the green party , which will be looking to break the 10 percent barrier , according to current polls .
schröder will nevertheless be looking for any signal that his party could turn its fortunes around in time for next spring 's electios . uwe seeler -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.09.2004 where words aren ’ t enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every case of sexual abuse destroys a child 's soul words often do n't suffice to express the horror of sexual violence .
a german art exhibit wants to make this problem more accessible , and strike a chord where language can ’ t get through . a pink rocking horse totters - an idyllic symbol of childhood .
a pink picket fence blocks the path , each board has the words noch immer or “ still ” painted on it .
but something is not quite right .
the rocking is far too fast and mechanical .
small card-size calendars line the wall for visitors to pick up .
where there 's usually advertising for a bank or a company on the back of the cards are the words : “ still , the five-year-old girl chokes on her father ’ s cock . ”
the art works are part of an exhibition on sexual violence against girls and women by the german artists renate bühn , maria mathieu and heike pich , currently on display in cologne .
“ with our exhibit , we wanted to make this topic very clearly visible , ” pich told dw-world .
the artists had worked with sexually abused women and girls for several years .
“ it eventually became clear to us that the spoken word has boundaries , ” pich said .
“ since all three of us were also artists , we thought this would be a form to reach people beyond words .
it is a means to affect people in a different way than just knowing the figures . ”
giving women courage the figures are disturbing .
according to the federal criminal police office bka in wiesbaden , there were 15,430 reported cases of sexual abuse against children in germany in 2003 .
but child protection organizations estimate that the number of unknown cases reaches 200,000 to 300,000 per year in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 2000 = 100 = 15 = 3 = 10 = 2 " by renate bühn .
out of 2,000 perpetrators , only two end up in jail the traveling exhibition has been underway since 2001 and is on its tenth leg here in cologne .
the artists said they want to confront the public with the topic of sexual abuse in the hope that more will be done to deal with this issue .
“ but we also want to give victims of sexual abuse courage , ” bühn said .
and that they do .
frauke mahr from the girls ' lobby group mädchenhaus köln is one of the exhibit 's co-organizers .
she said visitors are very struck by the display .
“ women who themselves experienced sexual violence , no matter when , said the way this exhibit deals with the topic made them feel especially understood and appropriately portrayed , " mahr said .
" i have the feeling that this is something liberating for these women . ”
a theological responsibility cologne 's protestant trinitatis church is hosting the exhibit “ was sehen sie , frau lot ? ” or “ what do you see , mrs. lot ? ”
the title is a reference to the biblical figure of lot , who had settled in sodom and received a warning of its destruction .
as he fled with his family , his wife , disobeying god ’ s orders , looked back at the city and was turned into a pillar of salt .
lot and his two virgin daughters went to live in a cave in the mountains .
the daughters proceed to give him wine and have incestuous relations with him , each one bearing his child .
" i had heard this story in my childhood and knew that something was n't right about it , " mathieu said .
according to the artists , the disempowerment of the mother precedes the sexual abuse of the daughters .
pastor christina schlarp from cologne ’ s federation of protestant churches said there are many theologians who do not believe the story as it 's portrayed in the bible .
" the father more likely raped his daughters and this has been glossed over and obscured , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church needs to expose the violence against girls and women for this reason , the church had a responsibility to closely examine this issue .
“ there are theological roots to violence against women and girls , which we have to work out and expose in order to overcome this violence , ” schlarp said .
the church setting also served another purpose .
“ we want to use public space and reach people who would normally not visit an exhibit on this issue , ” mathieu said .
past venues have included city halls , vocational schools and museums .
leaving a deeper mark political support for battling sexual abuse is not lacking .
one of the exhibit 's patrons , renate augstein from the federal ministry for women and youth , said the government is very active through campaigns and education measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike pich 's untitled work illustrates how sexual abuse shatters childhood " there is a lot of material on this topic , so that is not the weak point , " she said .
" but i 've often experienced that paper is gladly accepted , but rarely read , " said augstein .
" for the most part , it ca n't leave a deeper mark . "
art , on the other hand , can do this .
" this is why an artistic debate on sexual violence is so important , " she said .
statistics and facts alone can not present a complete picture of what sexual abuse entails .
the artists and organizers hope that through the artwork , people will see the effects of sexual abuse more clearly and do more to reduce its occurrence . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focused on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 cologne hosts anti-spam congress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam-busters if your e-mail address is on the internet , then chances are you 're getting spam offering penis extensions , porn and potency pills .
what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "

nothing more stands in the way of turkey 's bid to join the eu .
both sides have cleared up their differences .
but are the irritations between brussels and ankara really dispelled ?
dw-radio 's bernd riegert doubts it . the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appears to be adaptive .
he recognized his tactical error in provoking the european union with a legal ban on adultery shortly before the commission was to decide on membership negotiations . erdogan promised brussels to design turkey 's legal reforms so they are consistent with the eu .
he also said the penal code will be pushed through by oct .
6 , when eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen will publish a report on turkey 's reform progress . on the basis of this , eu leaders will decide in december whether to start eu membership negotiations with ankara . so was all the excitement just a storm in a tea cup ? erdogan as an islamic submarine verheugen and erdogan were so vocal in expressing their mutual friendship that it almost seemed suspicious .
on the surface , the rift between the two sides appeared mended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , left , and eu expansion commissioner günter verheugen : new best friends ?
but the episode left its mark .
serious doubts are circling in brussels about the course of erdogan , who has turned from radical to moderate , as well as the ultra conservative members of his justice and development party akp . the european parliament 's conservative faction even suspects that erdogan will hold back controversial laws until eu membership negotiations actually begin next year . only then , when there is no turning back for the eu , will the prime minister show his true face and put the brakes on societal reforms : erdogan as an islamic submarine , so to speak . but proponents of turkey 's membership reject this theory .
there 's no turning back for turkey either , they said .
reforms have just started .
should erdogan change his course during negotiations , he would seriously endanger eu entry . the european rules the commission 's new conservative president jose barroso was considerably more critical of turkey 's development than verheugen . barroso told the french newspaper le monde that turkey at present did not fulfill all the conditions for beginning membership negotiations .
turkey had to get used to european rules and not vice-versa , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey would like to see its flag permanently flying in brussels .
skepticism is growing .
maybe it is also europe 's fear of its own courage .
barroso said , rightly so , that turkey 's admission into the eu would be a revolutionary turning point .
and eu internal market commissioner frits bolkestein warned that turkey could implode the old union . critical remarks also came from french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin of late .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.09.2004 transplant laws under microscope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : science , not wealth , should decide who receives transplant surgery facing a growing list of patients in desperate need of an organ transplant , germany 's ethics council met to discuss ways of loosening the country 's strict transplant laws .
the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2004 the chancellor 's long road back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't been the most popular guy in germany chancellor gerhard schröder has come up to the halftime of his second term as the country 's leader .
the road so far has been extremely rocky - is a turnaround in sight ? after their worst result in decades in elections in the former spd stronghold of saarland earlier this month , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats received better news in elections in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony last weekend .
his spd lost considerably less in the two tests of voter opinion than his domestic rivals from the conservative cdu , something schröder believes will turn around his political fortunes .
" i see that the trend has been reversed and i also see that the conservatives are failing in their attempts to reap political profit from our difficulties with the implementation of the reforms , " schröder said in an interview with german public broadcaster ard .
" there are some exciting times but also a tough two years ahead of us until general elections in 2006 . “ globalization forced reforms schröder defended his agenda 2010 reforms in the interview which include deep cuts in social welfare benefits and a substantial overhaul of the health care and pensions systems .
he said that tough economic competition in globalized markets and the costs of an aging german population had forced the government to take measures that are bound to be perceived as painful and unjust by some people .
schröder stopped short of repeating remarks he made last weekend criticizing parts of the population who were seeking maximum benefit from the state with giving anything in return .
the chancellor also countered criticism , especially from german industry , that his reform drive had now come to a halt with half of the job left undone .
" what is ahead of us is the implementation of the most fundamental social welfare reform of all times and our task in the future is to ensure that the reforms are running smoothly , “ schröder said .
industry wants to continue momentum industry leaders urged schröder to continue his drive to lower labor costs that make the country the most expensive im europe for foreign investors .
" we are still lacking a coherent concept that includes further structural changes , " said dieter hundt , who heads the confederation of german employer 's association .
" german businesses are still languishing under a high burden of taxes and contributions to the state and social systems . “ the country 's opposition greeted the halfway point in schröder 's second tenure with continued criticism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angel merkel " his record is nothing to be proud of , " said cdu leader angela merkel , who is setting her sights on the chancellor 's office in 2006 . " in the past two years 1,000 jobs have been lost every day .
his promises of more than 2 million new jobs to be created through his reforms have been utterly false .
in addition the nation is indebted like never before . “ municipal elections this sunday a barometer whether the rest of the populace shares merkel 's concerns can , at least in part , be measured on sunday , when municipal elections are held in the spd-governed state of north rhine-westphalia .
five years ago , the conservatives broke the spd 's iron grip on germany 's most populous state .
the cdu hopes success in this sunday 's municipal elections across the state will promise more of the same when the governship is up for grabs in may 2005 .
pollsters say that although the cdu will dominate , they wo n't do so as convincingly as forecast a few months ago .

the chancellor cautioned against drastic steps . according to legislation passed seven years ago , organ transplants are only allowed if donors have expressed their consent via a donor card or if approved by the deceased person 's closest relatives .
the law makes germany the only country in the european union where purchasing organs from living donors is illegal at a time when the number of willing donors is steadily declining .
" the principle of solidarity in german health care can only be maintained if a central clearing house system ensures the distribution of organs , " chancellor gerhard schröder told the council .
" we must never allow organ transplantation to depend on individual income . "
the chancellor made his remarks friday during a meeting of the german ethics council - a panel of german scientists and experts who advise the government on issues like stem cell research and human cloning .
the council is currently working on new guidelines for organ transplantation .
some scientists find germany 's total ban on any trade in human organs to be counterproductive .
the list of patients waiting for vital organs is getting longer and longer while willingness to donate them is dropping among the population .
few german donors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of germans are willing to give up their organs after they die only about 6 million germans , or 8 percent of the population , are currently registered as potential donors , 10 percent less than last year , said eckhard nagel , a transplant surgeon at a hospital in berlin .
" about one and a half years ago i personally saw no reason to waste a thought on the issue because for me the human body couldn ’ t be for sale , " he said .
" but in the wake of a stronger commercialization of life , we are forced to come up with an agreement on ethical principles guiding monetary aspects in organ transplantation . "
german laws shouldn ’ t be relaxed to such an extent that they promote a lively trade in organs from third world donors , as is the case in other european countries .
the the first step should be to tap into germans ' overwhelming readiness to donate organs , ethics panel member wolfgang van den daele said .
" we should try to make people understand that it ’ s a fair deal they are getting , " he said .
" we should tell people they can expect an organ transplant in return for expressing their willingness to donate one . "
for the time being though the experts have been suggesting more practical steps .
one proposes lifting the ban on the transplantation of organs without consent from patients who suffer a stroke and who have n't explicitly ruled out a transplant .
experts believe such a step would increase the availability of organs without fostering the transplant tourism that is prevalent in many countries around the world . uwe hessler -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe struggling to find organ donors advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries .

what to do to stem the unwanted flood of junk e-mail ?
hold a conference , of course . when the internet was launched in the early 1990 's , businesses praised the innovation that would " revolutionize the business world . "
with e-mail , contracts could be wrapped up in seconds , at the press of a button .
borders and oceans no longer imposed barriers on communication .
but spam has become the new barrier to e-mail traffic .
the unwanted advertisements inundate e-mail accounts , to the extreme annoyance of those who have to waste precious time at the office deleting them .
to help bring the spam plague to an end , business leaders and politicians met this week in cologne for the second anti-spam congress organized by sven karge from the german association for the internet economy .
half of all e-mails are spam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spam gets its name from the canned american luncheon meat " the problem is that with little or no money , you can effortlessly send commercials to people 's e-mail accounts .
of course , dubious advertisers take advantage of this .
the total amount of junk mail in a mailbox has amounted to 50 percent , " said karge .
karge said that there 's a very real danger that firms will have to resort to using the fax machine if spammers persist in destroying e-mail service .
his organization is trying to raise awareness of the problem in other eu countries so that there 'll be a more unified effort against spammers .
such a concentrated , cross-border effort is desperately needed , as 90 percent of spam mailed to german accounts originates abroad .
germany and other eu countries have laws banning advertisers from pestering e-mail users with junk mails , but the laws are hard to enforce .
" it is very difficult to identify spammers , as they usually like to keep their identity in the dark .
laws can not replace effective self protection , " said stefan antweppen from germany 's ministry of economy and labor .
" i like to compare spam with my house , " antweppen added .
" you can not leave all doors and windows open in your house and go away for three weeks on vacation , and later complain to the government that somebody broke into your house . "
he advises individuals to use software , such as spam filters and virus scanners to protect themselves against spam .
" technically we are on an very advanced level .
depending on which filters you use , e-mails can be evaluated and than classified as spam .
eighty percent of all mails recognized as spam are indeed spam , " said michael scheffler , sales manager at clearswift , a company that specializes in e-mail and internet security .
mobile phones to be targeted as of yet , there is no method that is 100 percent effective against unsolicited e-mail .
nor is there protection against accidentally deleting non-spam mail falsely recognized as spam mail .
governments and companies are only beginning to come to terms with e-mail spam , said scheffler .
and he warned that the next plague - spam in the form of text messages on mobile phones - is on the horizon . alina fichter -lrb- wo -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepares laws to battle spam germany is set to follow the recent decision by the united states to implement legislation to prosecute anyone found guilty of distributing junk e-mails , known as spam . -lrb- march 3 , 2004 -rrb- putting the lid on spam spam has become a worldwide scourge that costs businesses and individuals nerves as well as billions of euros each year .

the archaeological dig at badbury rings near wimborne in dorset has uncovered evidence that the site was inhabited at least 5,000 years ago .
the excavations , which were prompted by concerns that tree roots on the summit were damaging the site , have found the remains of a neolithic settlement .
the national trust dig on the hill fort ends on friday .
martin papworth , national trust archaeologist for wessex , said : " to date , it is the only hill fort of this size not to be excavated in the area .
the dig has uncovered neolithic flints at the site " we are hoping that this first excavation of badbury ring will help us untangle the chronology of this important piece of dorset 's history . "
the evidence found so far dates the first occupation of badbury rings , which are part of the national trust 's kingston lacy estate , between 3500 and 1500 bc .

they are being urged to follow a five-point safety checklist and ensure appliances have been professionally installed and maintained .
by law , landlords should have gas appliances checked annually .

mr kennedy , buoyed by recent opinion polls and by-elections , said the uk was now in a new three party era .
at the next election voters would have a choice between two essentially conservative parties , or the real alternative of the lib dems , he said .
labour and the tories argue the lib dems still lack credibility .
bbc political editor andrew marr said mr kennedy 's speech was personal and well-thought through , with the strongest passage his description of the " sullen and increasingly angry " public mood about iraq .
the lib dem leader began his speech in bournemouth on a sombre note , saying the torture felt by ken bigley , the man held hostage in iraq , and his family must be " incomprehensible " .
he said they were at the forefront of his thoughts and prayers and said the conference displayed the " luxury of democracy " .
if the prime minister still refuses , the people can make a judgement charles kennedy at-a-glance : lib dem conference he then turned to domestic politics , arguing that the lib dems were now setting the " political weather " on issues like scrapping university tuition fees and replacing council tax .
mr kennedy said the lib dems were bringing a " breath of fresh air " to british politics : " that 's why we 're on the move . "
he acknowledged recent electoral successes meant people were now asking whether the party was up to the challenge and if they could be sure about what they stood for .
much of his speech was devoted to addressing those questions , saying the party 's core values of freedom , fairness and trust " matched the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st britain " .
asylum stance mr kennedy highlighted lib dem plans to offer free personal care for the elderly , improve school standards , increase education in prisons and help crime victims .
the lib dems have to be prepared to " stand alone " against knee-jerk responses to cultural issues and not " pander to the lowest denominator " on asylum and immigration but make the systems fairer and faster .
but he also turned his fire on the other parties , saying the tories had failed to connect with people and " hark back to a britain that is no more " .
iraq is a galvanising factor , says kennedy he branded them as the " third party " in huge swathes of the country .
" in so much of the country , a vote for the conservatives is a wasted vote , " said mr kennedy in a deliberate reversal of previous attacks on his own party .
he told the conference that with the tories on the way to extinction , the next task is to continue eroding the labour vote while focusing fire on the conservatives to finish them off .
" the british people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the liberal democrats ...
" and we , increasingly , are winning the choice . "
iraq effect mr kennedy also launched another fierce attack on tony blair 's decision to go to war in iraq .
he said it was time the prime minister answered the crunch question of whether he promised to follow america into the conflict " come what may " .
he predicted the iraq issue would galvanise people to " make their views known through the ballot box " .
" never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence , " he said .
" never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the united nations . "
' bravado ' mr kennedy stopped short of the rallying cry issued by his campaigns chief lord razzall who told the conference the lib dems would be the next non-labour government .
but labour general election co-ordinator alan milburn said the lib dems had still not passed the credibility test .
it 's not just their sums that do n't add up - their policies do n't add up , " said mr milburn .
" they masquerade as a party of liberal leftism - but this week has begun to lift the veil on policies that would damage hard-working families and hit the poorest hardest . "
conservative chairman liam fox dismissed as " utter nonsense " lib dem attempts to portray themselves as political heavyweights .
" charles kennedy 's foolish bravado ignores the fact that under paddy ashdown in 1996 , the lib dems controlled 55 councils - this figure has now dropped to 30 ...
" it seems that on election statistics they are just as out of touch with reality as they are on policy proposals . "

mr kennedy , buoyed by recent opinion polls and by-elections , said the uk was now in a new three party era .
at the next election voters would have a choice between two essentially conservative parties , or the real alternative of the lib dems , he said .
labour and the tories argue the lib dems still lack credibility .
bbc political editor andrew marr said mr kennedy 's speech was personal and well-thought through , with the strongest passage his description of the " sullen and increasingly angry " public mood about iraq .
the lib dem leader began his speech in bournemouth on a sombre note , saying the torture felt by ken bigley , the man held hostage in iraq , and his family must be " incomprehensible " .
he said they were at the forefront of his thoughts and prayers and said the conference displayed the " luxury of democracy " .
if the prime minister still refuses , the people can make a judgement charles kennedy at-a-glance : lib dem conference he then turned to domestic politics , arguing that the lib dems were now setting the " political weather " on issues like scrapping university tuition fees and replacing council tax .
mr kennedy said the lib dems were bringing a " breath of fresh air " to british politics : " that 's why we 're on the move . "
he acknowledged recent electoral successes meant people were now asking whether the party was up to the challenge and if they could be sure about what they stood for .
much of his speech was devoted to addressing those questions , saying the party 's core values of freedom , fairness and trust " matched the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st britain " .
asylum stance mr kennedy highlighted lib dem plans to offer free personal care for the elderly , improve school standards , increase education in prisons and help crime victims .
the lib dems have to be prepared to " stand alone " against knee-jerk responses to cultural issues and not " pander to the lowest denominator " on asylum and immigration but make the systems fairer and faster .
but he also turned his fire on the other parties , saying the tories had failed to connect with people and " hark back to a britain that is no more " .
iraq is a galvanising factor , says kennedy he branded them as the " third party " in huge swathes of the country .
" in so much of the country , a vote for the conservatives is a wasted vote , " said mr kennedy in a deliberate reversal of previous attacks on his own party .
he told the conference that with the tories on the way to extinction , the next task is to continue eroding the labour vote while focusing fire on the conservatives to finish them off .
" the british people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the liberal democrats ...
" and we , increasingly , are winning the choice . "
iraq effect mr kennedy also launched another fierce attack on tony blair 's decision to go to war in iraq .
he said it was time the prime minister answered the crunch question of whether he promised to follow america into the conflict " come what may " .
he predicted the iraq issue would galvanise people to " make their views known through the ballot box " .
" never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence , " he said .
" never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the united nations . "
' bravado ' mr kennedy stopped short of the rallying cry issued by his campaigns chief lord razzall who told the conference the lib dems would be the next non-labour government .
but labour general election co-ordinator alan milburn said the lib dems had still not passed the credibility test .
it 's not just their sums that do n't add up - their policies do n't add up , " said mr milburn .
" they masquerade as a party of liberal leftism - but this week has begun to lift the veil on policies that would damage hard-working families and hit the poorest hardest . "
conservative chairman liam fox dismissed as " utter nonsense " lib dem attempts to portray themselves as political heavyweights .
" charles kennedy 's foolish bravado ignores the fact that under paddy ashdown in 1996 , the lib dems controlled 55 councils - this figure has now dropped to 30 ...

mr kennedy , buoyed by recent opinion polls and by-elections , said the uk was now in a new three party era .
at the next election voters would have a choice between two essentially conservative parties , or the real alternative of the lib dems , he said .
labour and the tories argue the lib dems still lack credibility .
bbc political editor andrew marr said mr kennedy 's speech was personal and well-thought through , with the strongest passage his description of the " sullen and increasingly angry " public mood about iraq .
the lib dem leader began his speech in bournemouth on a sombre note , saying the torture felt by ken bigley , the man held hostage in iraq , and his family must be " incomprehensible " .
he said they were at the forefront of his thoughts and prayers and said the conference displayed the " luxury of democracy " .
if the prime minister still refuses , the people can make a judgement charles kennedy at-a-glance : lib dem conference he then turned to domestic politics , arguing that the lib dems were now setting the " political weather " on issues like scrapping university tuition fees and replacing council tax .
mr kennedy said the lib dems were bringing a " breath of fresh air " to british politics : " that 's why we 're on the move . "
he acknowledged recent electoral successes meant people were now asking whether the party was up to the challenge and if they could be sure about what they stood for .
much of his speech was devoted to addressing those questions , saying the party 's core values of freedom , fairness and trust " matched the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st britain " .
asylum stance mr kennedy highlighted lib dem plans to offer free personal care for the elderly , improve school standards , increase education in prisons and help crime victims .
the lib dems have to be prepared to " stand alone " against knee-jerk responses to cultural issues and not " pander to the lowest denominator " on asylum and immigration but make the systems fairer and faster .
but he also turned his fire on the other parties , saying the tories had failed to connect with people and " hark back to a britain that is no more " .
iraq is a galvanising factor , says kennedy he branded them as the " third party " in huge swathes of the country .
" in so much of the country , a vote for the conservatives is a wasted vote , " said mr kennedy in a deliberate reversal of previous attacks on his own party .
he told the conference that with the tories on the way to extinction , the next task is to continue eroding the labour vote while focusing fire on the conservatives to finish them off .
" the british people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the liberal democrats ...
" and we , increasingly , are winning the choice . "
iraq effect mr kennedy also launched another fierce attack on tony blair 's decision to go to war in iraq .
he said it was time the prime minister answered the crunch question of whether he promised to follow america into the conflict " come what may " .
he predicted the iraq issue would galvanise people to " make their views known through the ballot box " .
" never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence , " he said .
" never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the united nations . "
' bravado ' mr kennedy stopped short of the rallying cry issued by his campaigns chief lord razzall who told the conference the lib dems would be the next non-labour government .
but labour general election co-ordinator alan milburn said the lib dems had still not passed the credibility test .
it 's not just their sums that do n't add up - their policies do n't add up , " said mr milburn .
" they masquerade as a party of liberal leftism - but this week has begun to lift the veil on policies that would damage hard-working families and hit the poorest hardest . "
conservative chairman liam fox dismissed as " utter nonsense " lib dem attempts to portray themselves as political heavyweights .
" charles kennedy 's foolish bravado ignores the fact that under paddy ashdown in 1996 , the lib dems controlled 55 councils - this figure has now dropped to 30 ...

bbc news online looks at the significance of the news .
what has happened ?
thirty-two-year-old mrs touirat had ovarian tissue removed prior from her left ovary to chemotherapy treatment for hodgkin 's lymphoma in 1997 .
she stopped ovulating after her cancer treatment .
in april 2003 , once she was declared cancer-free , her ovarian tissue was transplanted back into her body , immediately underneath her right ovary .
in june last year , tests showed she had begun to ovulate again .
this year , she conceived naturally .
she has now given birth to a 3.72kg -lrb- just over 8lb -rrb- baby girl named tamara .
the team treating the woman , from belgium 's université catholique de louvain say in the lancet medical journal that all the evidence they have seen shows it was the transplanted ovarian tissue which ripened into the egg that was fertilised in the pregnancy .
they can say this because the egg follicle which ripened to produce that egg was seen growing on the tissue during the menstrual cycle during which mrs touirat became pregnant .
why is this birth significant ?
women who undergo chemotherapy can lose their fertility because of the powerful drugs used in their treatment .
many will not .
however , if radiotherapy treatment affects the ovaries , it immediately makes a woman infertile .
scientists have been looking at how they can restore fertility to affected women .
doctors began freezing cancer patients ' ovarian tissue , prior to treatment , in the late 1990s .
since then , teams in the us and europe have worked first to successfully transplant the tissue back into women .
both have shown normal ovarian function has been restored , and women have been having periods .
they were aiming to use embryos created using ivf to help women become pregnant .
but none of the women treated have become pregnant , making the belgian case highly significant .
how do ovary transplants work ?
eggs are formed in cavities in the ovaries called follicles .
as well as generating eggs , the ovaries pump out hormones that are vital for a woman to conceive .
doctors take tiny strips of ovarian tissue , one to two millimetres thick , from the most productive part of the ovary .
these are then cut into sections and frozen in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of almost minus 200ºc .
ovarian tissue can be transplanted to any part of the body and still function .
eggs are then removed and used in ivf treatment .
it is understood that in the belgian case , the tissue was placed at the end of the fallopian tube under the right ovary , allowing a natural pregnancy .
what does this mean for other women ?
it offers them great hope .
for many women treated for cancer , the news they could be left infertile by their treatment is as devastating as the news of the cancer itself .
while experts in the field say they want to know more about the belgian pregnancy , and to see pregnancies in other women , they say it is a major breakthrough .
could it help other women ?
yes .
although researchers in the field are concentrating on helping cancer patients , the technique could also be used by women who want to extend their reproductive life .
the menopause puts an end to women 's childbearing years .
but this technique means they could have the option of having some of their ovarian tissue removed and frozen , and then stored .
once they have been through the menopause , it could be replanted , offering them another chance of motherhood .
is there anything which could stop more women benefiting ?
some fertility experts have expressed fears over a new eu directive which sets standards for the sterility and storage of human tissues and cells .
they fear these regulations would be very difficult for ivf clinics to meet .

bbc news online looks at the significance of the news .
what has happened ?
thirty-two-year-old mrs touirat had ovarian tissue removed prior from her left ovary to chemotherapy treatment for hodgkin 's lymphoma in 1997 .
she stopped ovulating after her cancer treatment .
in april 2003 , once she was declared cancer-free , her ovarian tissue was transplanted back into her body , immediately underneath her right ovary .
in june last year , tests showed she had begun to ovulate again .
this year , she conceived naturally .
she has now given birth to a 3.72kg -lrb- just over 8lb -rrb- baby girl named tamara .
the team treating the woman , from belgium 's université catholique de louvain say in the lancet medical journal that all the evidence they have seen shows it was the transplanted ovarian tissue which ripened into the egg that was fertilised in the pregnancy .
they can say this because the egg follicle which ripened to produce that egg was seen growing on the tissue during the menstrual cycle during which mrs touirat became pregnant .
why is this birth significant ?
women who undergo chemotherapy can lose their fertility because of the powerful drugs used in their treatment .
many will not .
however , if radiotherapy treatment affects the ovaries , it immediately makes a woman infertile .
scientists have been looking at how they can restore fertility to affected women .
doctors began freezing cancer patients ' ovarian tissue , prior to treatment , in the late 1990s .
since then , teams in the us and europe have worked first to successfully transplant the tissue back into women .
both have shown normal ovarian function has been restored , and women have been having periods .
they were aiming to use embryos created using ivf to help women become pregnant .
but none of the women treated have become pregnant , making the belgian case highly significant .
how do ovary transplants work ?
eggs are formed in cavities in the ovaries called follicles .
as well as generating eggs , the ovaries pump out hormones that are vital for a woman to conceive .
doctors take tiny strips of ovarian tissue , one to two millimetres thick , from the most productive part of the ovary .
these are then cut into sections and frozen in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of almost minus 200ºc .
ovarian tissue can be transplanted to any part of the body and still function .
eggs are then removed and used in ivf treatment .
it is understood that in the belgian case , the tissue was placed at the end of the fallopian tube under the right ovary , allowing a natural pregnancy .
what does this mean for other women ?
it offers them great hope .
for many women treated for cancer , the news they could be left infertile by their treatment is as devastating as the news of the cancer itself .
while experts in the field say they want to know more about the belgian pregnancy , and to see pregnancies in other women , they say it is a major breakthrough .
could it help other women ?
yes .
although researchers in the field are concentrating on helping cancer patients , the technique could also be used by women who want to extend their reproductive life .
the menopause puts an end to women 's childbearing years .
but this technique means they could have the option of having some of their ovarian tissue removed and frozen , and then stored .
once they have been through the menopause , it could be replanted , offering them another chance of motherhood .

the firm said it needs to delist so it can secure a deal with creditors .
rebel shareholders have opposed its restructuring plans and nearly forced the company into administration .
british energy was once one of the uk 's largest listed companies but last year 's low power prices hit the nuclear energy company 's finances hard .
the firm 's shares fell further on friday down 25p in early morning trade to 15.00p after falling 16 % on thursday .
' dismayed ' the east kilbride-based nuclear generator said it wanted to delist from the uk stock exchange by 21 october and also wants to cancel its us stock market listing .
once it has delisted , and hindered the rebellion by two shareholders , it will have a meeting on 22 october .
what next for shareholders sep 24 : shareholders get official notice of british energy 's intention to delist oct 20 : shareholders must decide whether to sell or keep shares by this date oct 21 : trading in british energy shares is likely to end oct 22 : shareholders get a chance to air their grievances at extraordinary general meeting " we have taken the decision to seek delisting with great reluctance but it is necessary to safeguard the interests of british energy , " said chairman adrian montague .
mr montague warned that if shareholders block the rescue , creditors would seek immediate payment of the £ 1.3bn owed .
that could force the company into administration , leaving the shareholders with nothing , he said .
the rebel shareholders are still expected to push for a vote on the delisting at the meeting even though it will be largely irrelevant since british energy will have already quit the stock market by then .
one of the disgruntled shareholders , polygon investment partners , said : " we are dismayed at what we see as the complete disregard this move shows for the company 's shareholders .
" polygon reserves its rights against both the company , and personally against each of its directors in this matter . "
in a separate legal action british energy failed to prevent polygon from calling an extraordinary general meeting , egm , after it was thrown out of court in new york on thursday .
shareholder row british energy has become embroiled in an increasingly bitter battle with two leading shareholders over its restructuring plans .
under the terms of an agreement british energy struck last year , the firm 's creditors agreed to waive £ 1.3bn in debt in return for control of the company .
existing shareholders would however receive only 2.5 % of the shares of the restructured firm and they argue that the deal undervalues the company because power prices have risen since then .
polygon and brandes investment partners , which own 10 % of the generator 's shares between them , want better terms for shareholders and want to vote on british energy 's plan to delist .
voting rights ?
but british energy has said that if there was a vote on delisting and shareholders voted against it , it would scupper the creditors ' agreement .
if for any reason british energy is unable to implement the agreed restructuring it may be unable to meet its financial obligations british energy see british energy 's share price breaching the agreement could also threaten continued government financial support for the firm , british energy believes .
on wednesday , british energy received eu approval for its restructuring plan , which is being partly financed by an estimated £ 3.5bn of state aid .
ultimately , if the creditor agreement fails , the company could be forced into insolvency , hence british energy 's reluctance to allow shareholders to vote .
the irony for shareholders is that if the delisting was to take place in six months time , then british energy would not be able to ignore their demand for a vote .
under new regulations to be introduced by financial services authority before the end of the year , companies would have to seek shareholder approval before they withdraw from the stock market .
hard choices investors now face a choice of selling their shares before 21 october or retaining their holdings in what will become a private company .
once the firm leaves the stock market , it will become more difficult for investors to buy and sell their shares and the value of their investment is unlikely to change greatly .
although financial insitutions control 70 % of british energy 's shares , 215,000 private investors still have a stake in the company 's future .
most of these investors bought shares in the company when it was privatised in 1996 .
five years ago , british energy shares were worth more than £ 7 each , giving the company a market value of more than £ 1bn .

the firm 's shares fell further on friday down 25p in early morning trade to 15.00p after falling 16 % on thursday .
' dismayed ' the east kilbride-based nuclear generator said it wanted to delist from the uk stock exchange by 21 october and also wants to cancel its us stock market listing .
once it has delisted , and hindered the rebellion by two shareholders , it will have a meeting on 22 october .
what next for shareholders sep 24 : shareholders get official notice of british energy 's intention to delist oct 20 : shareholders must decide whether to sell or keep shares by this date oct 21 : trading in british energy shares is likely to end oct 22 : shareholders get a chance to air their grievances at extraordinary general meeting " we have taken the decision to seek delisting with great reluctance but it is necessary to safeguard the interests of british energy , " said chairman adrian montague .
mr montague warned that if shareholders block the rescue , creditors would seek immediate payment of the £ 1.3bn owed .
that could force the company into administration , leaving the shareholders with nothing , he said .
the rebel shareholders are still expected to push for a vote on the delisting at the meeting even though it will be largely irrelevant since british energy will have already quit the stock market by then .
one of the disgruntled shareholders , polygon investment partners , said : " we are dismayed at what we see as the complete disregard this move shows for the company 's shareholders .
" polygon reserves its rights against both the company , and personally against each of its directors in this matter . "
in a separate legal action british energy failed to prevent polygon from calling an extraordinary general meeting , egm , after it was thrown out of court in new york on thursday .
shareholder row british energy has become embroiled in an increasingly bitter battle with two leading shareholders over its restructuring plans .
under the terms of an agreement british energy struck last year , the firm 's creditors agreed to waive £ 1.3bn in debt in return for control of the company .
existing shareholders would however receive only 2.5 % of the shares of the restructured firm and they argue that the deal undervalues the company because power prices have risen since then .
polygon and brandes investment partners , which own 10 % of the generator 's shares between them , want better terms for shareholders and want to vote on british energy 's plan to delist .
voting rights ?
but british energy has said that if there was a vote on delisting and shareholders voted against it , it would scupper the creditors ' agreement .
if for any reason british energy is unable to implement the agreed restructuring it may be unable to meet its financial obligations british energy see british energy 's share price breaching the agreement could also threaten continued government financial support for the firm , british energy believes .
on wednesday , british energy received eu approval for its restructuring plan , which is being partly financed by an estimated £ 3.5bn of state aid .
ultimately , if the creditor agreement fails , the company could be forced into insolvency , hence british energy 's reluctance to allow shareholders to vote .
the irony for shareholders is that if the delisting was to take place in six months time , then british energy would not be able to ignore their demand for a vote .
under new regulations to be introduced by financial services authority before the end of the year , companies would have to seek shareholder approval before they withdraw from the stock market .
hard choices investors now face a choice of selling their shares before 21 october or retaining their holdings in what will become a private company .
once the firm leaves the stock market , it will become more difficult for investors to buy and sell their shares and the value of their investment is unlikely to change greatly .
although financial insitutions control 70 % of british energy 's shares , 215,000 private investors still have a stake in the company 's future .
most of these investors bought shares in the company when it was privatised in 1996 .
five years ago , british energy shares were worth more than £ 7 each , giving the company a market value of more than £ 1bn .

the commonwealth games council for scotland handed the city the scottish bid because it believed it offered the best possible chance of success .
the council unanimously backed the city at a meeting in stirling on thursday .
scotland and glasgow may go up against rivals in south africa , wales , singapore , canada and new zealand if the council decide to pursue a bid .
the council pointed out that the potential bid was still in its early stages and it would decide next year on whether to go for the games .
it also said its decision did not necessarily mean edinburgh would not be involved in any final scottish bid .
louise martin , chairwoman of the commonwealth games council for scotland , said : " it is always difficult to have to choose one over another but , based on the assessment , we were unanimous that working with glasgow as lead city would give us the best possible chance of success in the future , should we decide to make a formal bid . "
i do believe our bid is strong and has a realistic chance of succeeding in the face of what is likely to be some very stiff competition from other commonwealth cities " charlie gordon glasgow city council leader " however , it is important to stress this is really only the start of the process .
" considerable work now needs to be done to establish if scotland can put together a strong bid which we are confident will more than meet the requirements of the commonwealth games federation and which also compares favourably against bids from other countries . "
the council 's decision to award glasgow the honour followed a technical evaluation of both city 's bids .
glasgow 's edge the candidates ' proposed sporting venues and transport and accommodation arrangements were among the considerations taken into account .
glasgow 's proposal , with two sport venue clusters near a planned games village , was felt to offer a distinct advantage .
the city has received money from the scottish executive and sportscotland to develop a national indoor sports arena .
it is also creating a regional indoor facility at toryglen and upgrading scotstoun stadium .
glasgow city council leader councillor charlie gordon asked for all of scotland to unite behind the glasgow bid .
he said : " i am naturally very pleased that glasgow 's bid for the 2014 games has been given the green light by the commonwealth games council for scotland .
" i do believe our bid is strong and has a realistic chance of succeeding in the face of what is likely to be some very stiff competition from other commonwealth cities . "
feasibility study a bid assessment group made up of scottish sports chiefs will now be set up to launch a feasibility study into glasgow 's chances of hosting the event .
they will compare the merits of glasgow - which has never hosted the games - with its international rivals and come back with a decision in summer 2005 .
it is understood a bid alone would cost about £ 1m and staging the games would cost hundreds of millions of pounds .
first minister jack mcconnell welcomed the announcement and said : " glasgow 's investment in sport over recent years has put them on the international map for major events .
" i want scotland to host major events and the commonwealth games is one of the best .
" a commonwealth games in glasgow would be a fantastic occasion for our country and for sport . "
the 2006 games will be hosted by melbourne in australia while the 2010 games have been awarded to new delhi in india .

the commonwealth games council for scotland handed the city the scottish bid because it believed it offered the best possible chance of success .
the council unanimously backed the city at a meeting in stirling on thursday .
scotland and glasgow may go up against rivals in south africa , wales , singapore , canada and new zealand if the council decide to pursue a bid .
the council pointed out that the potential bid was still in its early stages and it would decide next year on whether to go for the games .
it also said its decision did not necessarily mean edinburgh would not be involved in any final scottish bid .
louise martin , chairwoman of the commonwealth games council for scotland , said : " it is always difficult to have to choose one over another but , based on the assessment , we were unanimous that working with glasgow as lead city would give us the best possible chance of success in the future , should we decide to make a formal bid .
i do believe our bid is strong and has a realistic chance of succeeding in the face of what is likely to be some very stiff competition from other commonwealth cities charlie gordon glasgow city council leader " however , it is important to stress this is really only the start of the process .
" considerable work now needs to be done to establish if scotland can put together a strong bid which we are confident will more than meet the requirements of the commonwealth games federation and which also compares favourably against bids from other countries . "
the council 's decision to award glasgow the honour followed a technical evaluation of both city 's bids .
glasgow 's edge the candidates ' proposed sporting venues and transport and accommodation arrangements were among the considerations taken into account .
glasgow 's proposal , with two sport venue clusters near a planned games village , was felt to offer a distinct advantage .
the city has received money from the scottish executive and sportscotland to develop a national indoor sports arena .
manchester staged the games two years ago it is also creating a regional indoor facility at toryglen and upgrading scotstoun stadium .
glasgow city council leader councillor charlie gordon asked for all of scotland to unite behind the glasgow bid .
he said : " i am naturally very pleased that glasgow 's bid for the 2014 games has been given the green light by the commonwealth games council for scotland .
" i do believe our bid is strong and has a realistic chance of succeeding in the face of what is likely to be some very stiff competition from other commonwealth cities . "
feasibility study a bid assessment group made up of scottish sports chiefs will now be set up to launch a feasibility study into glasgow 's chances of hosting the event .
they will compare the merits of glasgow - which has never hosted the games - with its international rivals and come back with a decision in summer 2005 .
it is understood a bid alone would cost about £ 1m and staging the games would cost hundreds of millions of pounds .
first minister jack mcconnell welcomed the announcement and said : " glasgow 's investment in sport over recent years has put them on the international map for major events .
" i want scotland to host major events and the commonwealth games is one of the best .
" a commonwealth games in glasgow would be a fantastic occasion for our country and for sport . "
the 2006 games will be hosted by melbourne in australia while the 2010 games have been awarded to new delhi in india .
