a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .
that changed in august when germany implemented the european union 's new common arrest warrant , which quickens and simplifies the process for handing over suspects between eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect detained in germany german authorities said friday they have detained a syrian-born german suspected of being a leading figure in osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network with the aim of extraditing him to spain .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .
that changed in august when germany implemented the european union 's new common arrest warrant , which quickens and simplifies the process for handing over suspects between eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect detained in germany german authorities said friday they have detained a syrian-born german suspected of being a leading figure in osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network with the aim of extraditing him to spain .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .
that changed in august when germany implemented the european union 's new common arrest warrant , which quickens and simplifies the process for handing over suspects between eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect detained in germany german authorities said friday they have detained a syrian-born german suspected of being a leading figure in osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network with the aim of extraditing him to spain .

germany is hosting a different sort of olympics - one where the disciplines include sauces and pastries and the " athletes " wear tall white hats .
all the more proof that cooking is becoming the new national pastime . unlike paris or new york , erfurt in eastern germany is not one of the world 's best-known gastronomic centers .
but from oct .
17 - 20 , erfurt is hosting the biggest assemblage of food professionals ever , as chefs from 38 nations bake , baste and braise their way to gold in the 2004 culinary olympics . " the concept was born here in germany 104 years ago , " reinhold metz , president of the association of german chefs told dw-world .
" first , it was known as the internationale kochkunst ausstellung , or ika .
but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .
germany is fast becoming a nation of food enthusiasts and hobby chefs , with an explosion of courses , tv shows , books and magazines all dedicated to the culinary arts . british invasion britt lippold , who owns kochlust , a shop offering cookbooks and cookery classes in berlin , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chef jamie oliver said the boom can largely be attributed to the popularity here of britain 's jamie oliver , otherwise known as the naked chef . " we 're a small store , but for a while , we were the store in germany that sold the most jamie oliver books , " lippold told dw-world . lippold shares oliver 's approach to cooking , which she describes as honest and down-to-earth .

poland , which also profits from eu subsidies , has become a favorite destination . " we want to stay , we want to stay ! " that 's what workers recently screamed at cuxhaven 's lysell company , which produces fish delicatessen .
warning strikes have been happening since the beginning of october , along with repeated negotiations between employee and management representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at a fish processing plant in tallinn the workers are protesting company plans to move the entire production , including 170 jobs , to tallinn , estonia 's capital .
leaders of germany 's food industry union ngg have already issued a complaint with the federal labor office about 150 job cuts . lysell workers got lucky in the end .
the state of lower saxony , where cuxhaven is located , vouched for a € 1.4 million -lrb- $ 1.76 million -rrb- credit for the company .
but employees will still have to give up some of their vacation and christmas bonuses and work longer in return for a three-year job guarantee . wage gap things do n't look much different in nearby bremerhaven - except that the happy end failed in this case .
delicatessen company nadler recently laid off 130 people and moved some of its production to poland .
nadler has long owned a plant in the polish town of poznan -lrb- posen -rrb- , where workers producing pickled herring only earn € 3.50 per hour . it 's a wage level germans ca n't compete with , said jürgen ohlzen , ngg 's general secretary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kasper , who works for bremerhaven 's fish auction house , holds up a red snapper " we could lower wages in germany by half and still would n't get anywhere near the polish level , " he said , adding that it 's a trend that concerns him . " this can lead to other companies saying , ' alright , now we can move to poland with a clean conscience as well . " ' many companies already have cooperation agreements or subsidiaries in poland , ohlzen added . " we ca n't compete with that , " he said . ten years ago , 4,500 people were still working in cuxhaven 's fish processing factories .
today , 1,500 workers are left . high eu subsidies after eu enlargement last may , shifting production to eastern europe has become even easier as poland and the baltic states are now members of the union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bremerhaven are sorting red snappers the bloc has set aside hundreds of millions of euros for the fishing industry in the 10 new member states - poland alone will receive € 200 million over the next three years to modernize its fishing sector .
just recently , 35 polish companies were certified to work according to eu hygiene standards , allowing them to produce for the common market . it 's these numbers that have not just ohlzen fearing that cuxhave n't workers wo n't have been the last ones to cry for help . jörn pietschke -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles struggle with eu reality after the initial euphoria of joining the eu in may , poles are grappling with the economic consequences : while farmers and used car sellers are upbeat , consumers and fishermen seem less enthusiastic about the changes .

germany is hosting a different sort of olympics - one where the disciplines include sauces and pastries and the " athletes " wear tall white hats .
all the more proof that cooking is becoming the new national pastime . unlike paris or new york , erfurt in eastern germany is not one of the world 's best-known gastronomic centers .

17 - 20 , erfurt is hosting the biggest assemblage of food professionals ever , as chefs from 38 nations bake , baste and braise their way to gold in the 2004 culinary olympics . " the concept was born here in germany 104 years ago , " reinhold metz , president of the association of german chefs told dw-world .
" first , it was known as the internationale kochkunst ausstellung , or ika .
but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .
germany is fast becoming a nation of food enthusiasts and hobby chefs , with an explosion of courses , tv shows , books and magazines all dedicated to the culinary arts . british invasion britt lippold , who owns kochlust , a shop offering cookbooks and cookery classes in berlin , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chef jamie oliver said the boom can largely be attributed to the popularity here of britain 's jamie oliver , otherwise known as the naked chef .

" i 'm not a traditionalist by any means , but i believe in old values in the positive sense , bringing people together , and bringing different cultures together through food , " she said . oliver 's success in germany has spawned homegrown copy-cats , such as star chef tim mälzer , who has a very oliver-esque show on german broadcaster , vox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maggi is encouraging young germans to stay in and cook even maggi , a popular brand of ready-made soups and sauces in germany , has jumped on the bandwagon , launching a new web site encouraging young german singles to forgo bars and discos in favour of a night in , cooking with friends . reinventing the classics the result could be a new lease on life for german cuisine , typically thought of as stodgy fare involving plenty of meat and potatoes .
lippold said her updated versions of classic german dishes are sought after by course participants .

poland , which also profits from eu subsidies , has become a favorite destination . " we want to stay , we want to stay ! " that 's what workers recently screamed at cuxhaven 's lysell company , which produces fish delicatessen .
warning strikes have been happening since the beginning of october , along with repeated negotiations between employee and management representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at a fish processing plant in tallinn the workers are protesting company plans to move the entire production , including 170 jobs , to tallinn , estonia 's capital .
leaders of germany 's food industry union ngg have already issued a complaint with the federal labor office about 150 job cuts . lysell workers got lucky in the end .
the state of lower saxony , where cuxhaven is located , vouched for a € 1.4 million -lrb- $ 1.76 million -rrb- credit for the company .
but employees will still have to give up some of their vacation and christmas bonuses and work longer in return for a three-year job guarantee . wage gap things do n't look much different in nearby bremerhaven - except that the happy end failed in this case .
delicatessen company nadler recently laid off 130 people and moved some of its production to poland .

" this can lead to other companies saying , ' alright , now we can move to poland with a clean conscience as well . " ' many companies already have cooperation agreements or subsidiaries in poland , ohlzen added . " we ca n't compete with that , " he said . ten years ago , 4,500 people were still working in cuxhaven 's fish processing factories .
today , 1,500 workers are left . high eu subsidies after eu enlargement last may , shifting production to eastern europe has become even easier as poland and the baltic states are now members of the union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers in bremerhaven are sorting red snappers the bloc has set aside hundreds of millions of euros for the fishing industry in the 10 new member states - poland alone will receive € 200 million over the next three years to modernize its fishing sector .
just recently , 35 polish companies were certified to work according to eu hygiene standards , allowing them to produce for the common market . it 's these numbers that have not just ohlzen fearing that cuxhave n't workers wo n't have been the last ones to cry for help . jörn pietschke -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles struggle with eu reality after the initial euphoria of joining the eu in may , poles are grappling with the economic consequences : while farmers and used car sellers are upbeat , consumers and fishermen seem less enthusiastic about the changes .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .

germany is hosting a different sort of olympics - one where the disciplines include sauces and pastries and the " athletes " wear tall white hats .
all the more proof that cooking is becoming the new national pastime . unlike paris or new york , erfurt in eastern germany is not one of the world 's best-known gastronomic centers .
but from oct .
17 - 20 , erfurt is hosting the biggest assemblage of food professionals ever , as chefs from 38 nations bake , baste and braise their way to gold in the 2004 culinary olympics . " the concept was born here in germany 104 years ago , " reinhold metz , president of the association of german chefs told dw-world .
" first , it was known as the internationale kochkunst ausstellung , or ika .
but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .
germany is fast becoming a nation of food enthusiasts and hobby chefs , with an explosion of courses , tv shows , books and magazines all dedicated to the culinary arts . british invasion britt lippold , who owns kochlust , a shop offering cookbooks and cookery classes in berlin , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chef jamie oliver said the boom can largely be attributed to the popularity here of britain 's jamie oliver , otherwise known as the naked chef . " we 're a small store , but for a while , we were the store in germany that sold the most jamie oliver books , " lippold told dw-world . lippold shares oliver 's approach to cooking , which she describes as honest and down-to-earth . " i 'm not a traditionalist by any means , but i believe in old values in the positive sense , bringing people together , and bringing different cultures together through food , " she said . oliver 's success in germany has spawned homegrown copy-cats , such as star chef tim mälzer , who has a very oliver-esque show on german broadcaster , vox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maggi is encouraging young germans to stay in and cook even maggi , a popular brand of ready-made soups and sauces in germany , has jumped on the bandwagon , launching a new web site encouraging young german singles to forgo bars and discos in favour of a night in , cooking with friends . reinventing the classics the result could be a new lease on life for german cuisine , typically thought of as stodgy fare involving plenty of meat and potatoes .
lippold said her updated versions of classic german dishes are sought after by course participants .
and metz , too , stressed the role the culinary olympics places in reinventing national specialties . " it 's very important to remember the old style of cooking , but also to find ways to prepare those old recipes in a modern way , " he said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frozen fondness not exactly known for their refined cuisine , a majority of germans turn to their freezers first even when wooing a potential partner on a first date , according to a new study .

germany is hosting a different sort of olympics - one where the disciplines include sauces and pastries and the " athletes " wear tall white hats .
all the more proof that cooking is becoming the new national pastime . unlike paris or new york , erfurt in eastern germany is not one of the world 's best-known gastronomic centers .
but from oct .
17 - 20 , erfurt is hosting the biggest assemblage of food professionals ever , as chefs from 38 nations bake , baste and braise their way to gold in the 2004 culinary olympics . " the concept was born here in germany 104 years ago , " reinhold metz , president of the association of german chefs told dw-world .
" first , it was known as the internationale kochkunst ausstellung , or ika .
but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .

germany is hosting a different sort of olympics - one where the disciplines include sauces and pastries and the " athletes " wear tall white hats .
all the more proof that cooking is becoming the new national pastime . unlike paris or new york , erfurt in eastern germany is not one of the world 's best-known gastronomic centers .
but from oct .
17 - 20 , erfurt is hosting the biggest assemblage of food professionals ever , as chefs from 38 nations bake , baste and braise their way to gold in the 2004 culinary olympics . " the concept was born here in germany 104 years ago , " reinhold metz , president of the association of german chefs told dw-world .
" first , it was known as the internationale kochkunst ausstellung , or ika .
but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .
germany is fast becoming a nation of food enthusiasts and hobby chefs , with an explosion of courses , tv shows , books and magazines all dedicated to the culinary arts . british invasion britt lippold , who owns kochlust , a shop offering cookbooks and cookery classes in berlin , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chef jamie oliver said the boom can largely be attributed to the popularity here of britain 's jamie oliver , otherwise known as the naked chef . " we 're a small store , but for a while , we were the store in germany that sold the most jamie oliver books , " lippold told dw-world . lippold shares oliver 's approach to cooking , which she describes as honest and down-to-earth . " i 'm not a traditionalist by any means , but i believe in old values in the positive sense , bringing people together , and bringing different cultures together through food , " she said . oliver 's success in germany has spawned homegrown copy-cats , such as star chef tim mälzer , who has a very oliver-esque show on german broadcaster , vox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maggi is encouraging young germans to stay in and cook even maggi , a popular brand of ready-made soups and sauces in germany , has jumped on the bandwagon , launching a new web site encouraging young german singles to forgo bars and discos in favour of a night in , cooking with friends . reinventing the classics the result could be a new lease on life for german cuisine , typically thought of as stodgy fare involving plenty of meat and potatoes .
lippold said her updated versions of classic german dishes are sought after by course participants .
and metz , too , stressed the role the culinary olympics places in reinventing national specialties . " it 's very important to remember the old style of cooking , but also to find ways to prepare those old recipes in a modern way , " he said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frozen fondness not exactly known for their refined cuisine , a majority of germans turn to their freezers first even when wooing a potential partner on a first date , according to a new study .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .
that changed in august when germany implemented the european union 's new common arrest warrant , which quickens and simplifies the process for handing over suspects between eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect detained in germany german authorities said friday they have detained a syrian-born german suspected of being a leading figure in osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network with the aim of extraditing him to spain .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .
that changed in august when germany implemented the european union 's new common arrest warrant , which quickens and simplifies the process for handing over suspects between eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect detained in germany german authorities said friday they have detained a syrian-born german suspected of being a leading figure in osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network with the aim of extraditing him to spain .

germany is hosting a different sort of olympics - one where the disciplines include sauces and pastries and the " athletes " wear tall white hats .
all the more proof that cooking is becoming the new national pastime . unlike paris or new york , erfurt in eastern germany is not one of the world 's best-known gastronomic centers .
but from oct .
17 - 20 , erfurt is hosting the biggest assemblage of food professionals ever , as chefs from 38 nations bake , baste and braise their way to gold in the 2004 culinary olympics . " the concept was born here in germany 104 years ago , " reinhold metz , president of the association of german chefs told dw-world .
" first , it was known as the internationale kochkunst ausstellung , or ika .
but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .
germany is fast becoming a nation of food enthusiasts and hobby chefs , with an explosion of courses , tv shows , books and magazines all dedicated to the culinary arts . british invasion britt lippold , who owns kochlust , a shop offering cookbooks and cookery classes in berlin , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chef jamie oliver said the boom can largely be attributed to the popularity here of britain 's jamie oliver , otherwise known as the naked chef . " we 're a small store , but for a while , we were the store in germany that sold the most jamie oliver books , " lippold told dw-world . lippold shares oliver 's approach to cooking , which she describes as honest and down-to-earth . " i 'm not a traditionalist by any means , but i believe in old values in the positive sense , bringing people together , and bringing different cultures together through food , " she said . oliver 's success in germany has spawned homegrown copy-cats , such as star chef tim mälzer , who has a very oliver-esque show on german broadcaster , vox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maggi is encouraging young germans to stay in and cook even maggi , a popular brand of ready-made soups and sauces in germany , has jumped on the bandwagon , launching a new web site encouraging young german singles to forgo bars and discos in favour of a night in , cooking with friends . reinventing the classics the result could be a new lease on life for german cuisine , typically thought of as stodgy fare involving plenty of meat and potatoes .
lippold said her updated versions of classic german dishes are sought after by course participants .
and metz , too , stressed the role the culinary olympics places in reinventing national specialties . " it 's very important to remember the old style of cooking , but also to find ways to prepare those old recipes in a modern way , " he said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frozen fondness not exactly known for their refined cuisine , a majority of germans turn to their freezers first even when wooing a potential partner on a first date , according to a new study .

but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .
germany is fast becoming a nation of food enthusiasts and hobby chefs , with an explosion of courses , tv shows , books and magazines all dedicated to the culinary arts . british invasion britt lippold , who owns kochlust , a shop offering cookbooks and cookery classes in berlin , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chef jamie oliver said the boom can largely be attributed to the popularity here of britain 's jamie oliver , otherwise known as the naked chef . " we 're a small store , but for a while , we were the store in germany that sold the most jamie oliver books , " lippold told dw-world . lippold shares oliver 's approach to cooking , which she describes as honest and down-to-earth . " i 'm not a traditionalist by any means , but i believe in old values in the positive sense , bringing people together , and bringing different cultures together through food , " she said . oliver 's success in germany has spawned homegrown copy-cats , such as star chef tim mälzer , who has a very oliver-esque show on german broadcaster , vox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maggi is encouraging young germans to stay in and cook even maggi , a popular brand of ready-made soups and sauces in germany , has jumped on the bandwagon , launching a new web site encouraging young german singles to forgo bars and discos in favour of a night in , cooking with friends . reinventing the classics the result could be a new lease on life for german cuisine , typically thought of as stodgy fare involving plenty of meat and potatoes .
lippold said her updated versions of classic german dishes are sought after by course participants .
and metz , too , stressed the role the culinary olympics places in reinventing national specialties . " it 's very important to remember the old style of cooking , but also to find ways to prepare those old recipes in a modern way , " he said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frozen fondness not exactly known for their refined cuisine , a majority of germans turn to their freezers first even when wooing a potential partner on a first date , according to a new study .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .
that changed in august when germany implemented the european union 's new common arrest warrant , which quickens and simplifies the process for handing over suspects between eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect detained in germany german authorities said friday they have detained a syrian-born german suspected of being a leading figure in osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network with the aim of extraditing him to spain .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .

germany is hosting a different sort of olympics - one where the disciplines include sauces and pastries and the " athletes " wear tall white hats .
all the more proof that cooking is becoming the new national pastime . unlike paris or new york , erfurt in eastern germany is not one of the world 's best-known gastronomic centers .
but from oct .
17 - 20 , erfurt is hosting the biggest assemblage of food professionals ever , as chefs from 38 nations bake , baste and braise their way to gold in the 2004 culinary olympics . " the concept was born here in germany 104 years ago , " reinhold metz , president of the association of german chefs told dw-world .
" first , it was known as the internationale kochkunst ausstellung , or ika .
but later on , when the americans started participating , the phrase culinary olympics began circulating .
we liked this , took it , and said we 'd turn it into an olympic event . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culinary olympics takes place every four years in germany .
in true olympic style , national teams of chefs compete in different disciplines , whipping up appetizers , main courses , and desserts in glass kitchens under the watchful eye of the judges .
there 's also a restaurant of nations , where the teams prepare national specialties , as well as separate events for junior chefs , pastry chefs and even military chefs - out to combat old notions of mystery mush unceremoniously ladled onto metal trays . participation is everything the teams are judged on speed , cleanliness , and of course , taste , said metz .
and he added that while the competition for the gold medals is intense , the olympic spirit is alive and well in erfurt . " more than winning medals , the event is about learning , learning , learning , " he said .
" the contestants can share their knowledge with each other , look at the show platters and buffets , take photographs .
for them , it 's a great opportunity . " " i 'm a veteran in the culinary arts , but a very important exercise for me was translating the menus from the national teams into german .
there were things i 'd never heard of before , and i had to ask for explanations , " metz added . this year , the culinary olympics could n't be more timely .
germany is fast becoming a nation of food enthusiasts and hobby chefs , with an explosion of courses , tv shows , books and magazines all dedicated to the culinary arts . british invasion britt lippold , who owns kochlust , a shop offering cookbooks and cookery classes in berlin , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chef jamie oliver said the boom can largely be attributed to the popularity here of britain 's jamie oliver , otherwise known as the naked chef . " we 're a small store , but for a while , we were the store in germany that sold the most jamie oliver books , " lippold told dw-world . lippold shares oliver 's approach to cooking , which she describes as honest and down-to-earth . " i 'm not a traditionalist by any means , but i believe in old values in the positive sense , bringing people together , and bringing different cultures together through food , " she said . oliver 's success in germany has spawned homegrown copy-cats , such as star chef tim mälzer , who has a very oliver-esque show on german broadcaster , vox . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maggi is encouraging young germans to stay in and cook even maggi , a popular brand of ready-made soups and sauces in germany , has jumped on the bandwagon , launching a new web site encouraging young german singles to forgo bars and discos in favour of a night in , cooking with friends . reinventing the classics the result could be a new lease on life for german cuisine , typically thought of as stodgy fare involving plenty of meat and potatoes .
lippold said her updated versions of classic german dishes are sought after by course participants .
and metz , too , stressed the role the culinary olympics places in reinventing national specialties . " it 's very important to remember the old style of cooking , but also to find ways to prepare those old recipes in a modern way , " he said . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frozen fondness not exactly known for their refined cuisine , a majority of germans turn to their freezers first even when wooing a potential partner on a first date , according to a new study .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2004 germany agrees on al qaeda suspect 's extradition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : darkazanli could be sent to spain for trial after germany 's decision mamoun darkazanli , the syrian-german accused of being a member of al qaeda 's 9/11 hamburg cell , could soon face extradition proceedings after german authorities cleared his case to go before a court hearing . the extradition to spain of an arab businessman long accused by the united states of financing al qaeda and investigated by german authorities for links to the september 11 " hamburg cell " has been cleared by german authorities . mamoun darkazanli , who holds both syrian and german citizenship , was arrested on friday in hamburg .
a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .
that changed in august when germany implemented the european union 's new common arrest warrant , which quickens and simplifies the process for handing over suspects between eu member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de al qaeda suspect detained in germany german authorities said friday they have detained a syrian-born german suspected of being a leading figure in osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network with the aim of extraditing him to spain .

a justice ministry spokesman said on sunday that the federal government saw no barrier to his extradition , although it needed first to be formally approved by a court . if darkazanli appears before a court and is then put on trial , the 46-year-old would be the third suspected associate of the hamburg cell to do so .
the group , led by egyptian mohamed atta , supplied three of the hijackers who led the suicide attacks on new york and washington in which nearly 3,000 people died . suspect remained free after 9/11 darkazanli 's import-export company was one of 27 groups or people whose us assets were ordered frozen by washington within two weeks of the attacks on suspicion of links to al qaeda leader osama bin laden . a month after the attacks , his name appeared on a united nations sanctions list of " individuals belonging to or associated with al qaeda " , obliging all countries to freeze his assets and deny him entry . amazingly , darkazanli remained free until he was detained on friday despite being one of five men under investigation by german prosecutors in connection with the 9/11 attacks . spanish indictment leads to detention friday 's arrest was carried out under a warrant issued by spain , where darkazanli was one of 35 people who were charged by judge baltasar garzon in september 2003 with belonging to al qaeda .
" al qaeda is expanding its tentacles around the world and among the key figures is mamoun darkazanli , " garzon said in his indictment . the huge document claims darkazanli had close personal contacts to imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , the alleged leader of al qaeda operations in spain . document lists meeting with terror suspects it lists dozens of telephone calls and meetings between darkazanli and other indicted suspects , and details four visits he made to spain from 1997 onwards .
the last took place in july 2001 , the same month that atta met other senior al qaeda figures in spain to finalize plans for the suicide attacks on the united states . the charge sheet says darkazanli carried out " logistics support and financing activity " for al qaeda , including the purchase of a cargo vessel for bin laden which he and two others bought in december 1993 . darkazanli acquired his german nationality by marriage , a factor which had held up his extradition until now .

he claims legislation is making it too difficult to exclude even pupils caught possessing knives .
the head told the bbc 's panorama programme that the use of knives was widespread in school and that he felt powerless to stop children bringing in weapons .
the secondary head , who works in a suburban school in south-east england , was the only teacher willing to be interviewed - and even then it was on the condition of anonymity - but panorama also spoke to several other heads off the record who told a similar story .
disastrous consequences it 's a definitely changing culture with the flick , switch blade right up to carving knives and meat cleavers anonymous head teacher he said : " people need to be honest about the reality that this knife culture does exist and head teachers do know that young people are carrying knives . "
the head claimed that knife culture within schools was rife in the 21st century and says he once caught a 14-year-old with a meat cleaver .
but he added that it was n't just older children who had used knives .
" it 's a secondary school where i am head but i have had to take knives from primary aged children , " he said .
" in the past the kind of knives would be little swiss army knives or pen knives , sometimes even just to have been used to sharpen pencils but more as a hobby knife .
lack of authority the head teacher claimed to have taken a machette from a 14-year-old " today , it 's a definitely changing culture with the flick , switch blade right up to carving knives and meat cleavers . "
he added that head teachers were scared of making public the fact that a child was excluded for carrying a knife , as it could have disastrous consequences for a school .
it could lead to loss of confidence by parents , the withdrawal of pupils and possibly the closure of the school and the end of a head teacher 's career .
he told the programme : " i would have no hesitation in pulling the full weight for exclusion .
but as a head teacher , you have n't got the authority sufficiently , you have to justify that decision .
" one has to explain the decision to the governing body and get it agreed that it 's upheld .
too far it 's gone too far frankly - to justify why we exclude young people when it 's absolutely apparent anonymous head teacher " the decision is not my own .
the governors can overturn it and so can the lea .
" and the parents will bring their representatives and they may well say - and this has happened - ' well the young person did n't use it , did n't intend using it , so they have n't done anything wrong ' .
all of that has to be taken into account .
" it 's gone too far frankly - to justify why we exclude young people when it 's absolutely apparent in some cases as to why it 's essential . "
there are guidelines relating to what head teachers can do in the event of a child being excluded .
under these , the head teacher does have the power to exclude pupils without the consent of the board of governors and the lea .
appeals the parents must be immediately informed in writing and told about their right to make representations to the governors .
any exclusion that would mean the pupil missing a public exam has to be reported to the governors and to the lea .
the governing body must consider all permanent exclusions and some fixed term exclusions .
the pupil also has a right to appeal against the exclusion to the local education authority .
it is now a criminal offence to carry a knife on school premises and the law states that the police should be called whenever someone is caught in possession of a knife in school .

the institute will be built at the site of the former gartcosh steel mill in lanarkshire .
the project , led by the scottish drugs enforcement agency -lrb- sdea -rrb- , aims to locate all the agencies fighting organised crime in one building .
sdea director graeme pearson said concentrating expertise on a single site would make combating organised crime more effective .
mr pearson said : " we 'll bring together all the experts from the different departments and organisations onto one site .
" they have similar targets , they gather together the intelligence they have on these targets and we 're able more effectively to answer the threat that serious and organised crime presents in scotland .
mr pearson said the move would send a message to crime bosses " additionally , in a national and international context , a campus says to europe that serious crime is not welcome here . "
it is understood that the drugs agency will be joined by a national forensic science unit , the immigration service , customs and excise and others .
building will take some two years , by which time an anti-organised crime agency for scotland will be operating .
a scottish executive spokeswoman said the campus could cost up to £ 40m .
" given the growing and evolving threat from serious and organised crime , we can not rest on our laurels , " she said .
" while discussions about the new centre of excellence are still at an early stage , we have set aside significant resources to enable planning to get under way . "
the former british steel works at gartcosh closed in 1986 .

david davis , the conservative mp for haltemprice and howden in east yorkshire , issued the warning after the maps went online this month .
mr davis said he had been contacted by one constituent whose home was shown as a risk even thought it has not been flooded for 60 years .
the mp has asked the environment secretary to act quickly .
postcode locations the maps were made available on the environment agency 's website less than two weeks ago .
they were intended to allow householders to check flood risks more accurately than before by using postcodes to identify property locations .
however , within days mr davis , who is also shadow home secretary , said he had been approached by constituents claiming that the maps incorrectly indicated that their homes were flood risks .
in one particular case , he said , a couple found that a potential buyer for their house was put off at the last moment after seeing that the property was marked as being in a danger area , despite not having flooded since at least the 1950s .
lacking precision " the environment agency claimed that the new flood maps would end the confusion surrounding flood risk , " said mr davis .
" clearly this is not the case .
if a property that has not flooded in living memory is marked as at risk of flooding , then the maps lack the required precision . "
" insurance premiums may rise and property prices may fall for many of my constituents as a result . "
the environment agency website does include a disclaimer stating that the maps are not wholly reliable in describing the risk to individual properties .
the environment agency was not available for comment .

assistant chief constable mick creedon said : " we want to try and rid the threat of knives and other weapons that can cause serious injury from the streets of our towns and cities .

gcses , a-levels and vocational qualifications should evolve over the next decade into a new diploma system , the tomlinson report recommends .
there would be fewer exams but , at advanced level , tougher questions would stretch the brightest .
the diploma would also cater for those wanting work-related learning and have an emphasis on basic skills .
exam burden the diploma would be at four overlapping levels : entry , foundation , intermediate and advanced .
new diploma - current equivalents advanced - as-level and a-level , level 3 nvq , btec nationals and others intermediate - gcses grades a * to c , intermediate gnvq , level 2 nvq and others foundation - gcses grades d to g , level 1 nvq and others entry level - entry level certificates one of the main aims has been to reduce the burden of exams currently faced by england 's teenagers - often described as the most tested in the world .
coursework , discredited as prone to cheating , would be drastically reduced .
