an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2004 foreign missions trouble soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan are under constant stress although germany has handed over the reins of the international security assistance force to canada , 1,700 german soldiers remain in afghanistan .
for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .

it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .
“ another interview , ” he asks , almost in disbelief .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2004 berlin goes berlinale lord of the films germany boosts profile of home-grown filmmakers abroad young film makers gather at talent campus culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.02.2004 the film farmer goes to market in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talbot keeps quiet about his personal berlinale favorites .
on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .
“ another interview , ” he asks , almost in disbelief .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.02.2004 asylum seekers in the netherlands face deportation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staring into an uncertain future .
a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2004 foreign missions trouble soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan are under constant stress although germany has handed over the reins of the international security assistance force to canada , 1,700 german soldiers remain in afghanistan .
for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .
the base re-alignment and closure program foresees a cut in 20 percent excess base capacity at a savings of $ 6.3 billion annually , according to the pentagon . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world interviews the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles f. wald .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .

in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.02.2004 foreign missions trouble soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan are under constant stress although germany has handed over the reins of the international security assistance force to canada , 1,700 german soldiers remain in afghanistan .
for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .

since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .
the base re-alignment and closure program foresees a cut in 20 percent excess base capacity at a savings of $ 6.3 billion annually , according to the pentagon . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world interviews the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles f. wald .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.02.2004 french parliament votes for headscarf ban in schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women with headscarves are a common sight in europe .
an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .

on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .

on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .
the base re-alignment and closure program foresees a cut in 20 percent excess base capacity at a savings of $ 6.3 billion annually , according to the pentagon . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world interviews the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles f. wald .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .
the base re-alignment and closure program foresees a cut in 20 percent excess base capacity at a savings of $ 6.3 billion annually , according to the pentagon . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world interviews the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles f. wald .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .

in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .

opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .

in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .
“ another interview , ” he asks , almost in disbelief .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .
the base re-alignment and closure program foresees a cut in 20 percent excess base capacity at a savings of $ 6.3 billion annually , according to the pentagon . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world interviews the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles f. wald .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

" what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .

but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .
the base re-alignment and closure program foresees a cut in 20 percent excess base capacity at a savings of $ 6.3 billion annually , according to the pentagon . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world interviews the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles f. wald .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .

secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.02.2004 french parliament votes for headscarf ban in schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women with headscarves are a common sight in europe .
an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .
in turkey , too , the controversy increasingly threatens to divide public opinion .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .

on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .
“ another interview , ” he asks , almost in disbelief .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .

in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.02.2004 asylum seekers in the netherlands face deportation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staring into an uncertain future .
a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .

struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .

on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .

a bill currently being debated by the dutch parliament could send more than 26,000 asylum seekers in the country packing .
the move reflects a growing trend in restrictive asylum policies across europe . the dutch parliament is debating a bill which would authorize the deportation of more than 26,000 asylum seekers who have exhausted all legal appeals - they will be sent home over the next three years . the bill - which is scheduled for a final vote next tuesday - is the latest effort to reduce the number of people seeking asylum in this once liberal bastion of multiculturalism and reflects a europe-wide trend towards stricter policies . on friday , the german parliament will debate a new immigration law , including asylum policy . thousands could be sent home the parliamentary debate follows weeks of lively and divisive public debate in the netherlands , where opinion polls show up to 60 percent of the dutch public is against the measure .
opposition groups have offered - as an alternative - granting general amnesty to asylum seekers currently residing in the netherlands . but the netherland 's immigration and integration minister , rita verdonk , declined the compromise , declaring that total amnesty would , " send the wrong signal " . but not all will be going home : 2,000 asylum seekers who have lived in the country for more than five years , have a clean police record and have applied for residency permits and another 200 who have claimed " hardship " status have been granted permission , according to the bill , to stay .
yet , that represents only a small portion of the thousands who applied for " hardship " status or have lived in the netherlands for more than five years . groups skeptical the plan will work minister verdonk still has some difficult questions to answer , like how she plans to proceed .
she has not been clear on the details .
meanwhile refugee and asylum organizations in the netherlands point to the fact that many refugees come from chaotic regions without functioning governments , which have proven none to willing to take people back . " this is not very realistic - it disregards the fact that return is simply impossible for some , " brian lit , a lawyer with the foundation for legal aid and asylum in the netherlands , told deutsche welle .
" this is a complicated issue and the minister has presented deportation as a very simple solution , which it is not , " he added . brigitta van den berg , a spokesperson for the dutch refugee council , concured .
" there are certain countries of origin which are not very cooperative in taking their nationals back , " she told deutsche welle .
she added that her organization was " extremely disappointed " by the minister 's decision to pursue this policy , as it was unfair to send back asylum seekers who have been in the netherlands for more than five years - many of whom have children who were born there .
the latter comprises about a third of those who would be sent home if the bill gets final approval . asylum seekers less welcome in the netherlands the plan is representative of the growing negative attitude towards foreigners in the netherlands , which has gradually reversed its once liberal asylum laws and replaced them with some of europe 's most restrictive ones . for example , larger numbers of those seeking asylum status are subjected to a 48-hour " accelerated procedure " upon first entering the country , 60 percent of whom are turned away , according to lit at the foundation for legal aid in asylum .
due to the tougher legislation , the number of asylum requests has decreased by 50 percent in the last year according to the dutch immigration ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch right wing politician pim fortuyn the dutch people 's resentment of foreigners was most effectively harnessed by controversial politician pim fortuyn -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was assassinated in 2002 .
in an unusual application of logic , fortuyn started the whole immigration debate two years ago , when he argued that it was immigrants ' intolerant attitudes , particularly those of muslim immigrants , that was undermining dutch liberal values . restrictions tighten throughout europe elsewhere in europe too , governments are embracing ever-more restrictive asylum policies , attempting to meet the needs of genuine asylum seekers , while stemming the tide of economic refugees and immigrants at a time when unemployment is high and social services overstretched . but some fear europeans are engaging in a " race to the bottom " , by implementing policies aimed at creating deterrents .
in short , encouraging " asylum shopping " , and hoping potential asylum seekers will feel they get a better deal elsewhere . but this " not in my backyard " mentality may not be in the best interests of asylum seekers , say human rights organizations .
" we have seen a profound degradation in terms of protecting the rights of asylum seekers in europe , " says julia hall , an expert on european asylum policies at human rights watch in new york city .
brigitta van den berg , of the dutch refugee council , agrees and feels that the creation of a europe-wide asylum policy , which is scheduled for completion in 2004 , may help address the issue . in germany , the parliament will debate the country 's first immigration law , including asylum policy , on friday . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de case of suffocated refugee reaches court after five years , three german border guards face a frankfurt court to answer questions on their involvement in the death of a sudanese refugee who died while being deported in 1999 .

on saturday , dan talbot and his six colleagues on the berlinale jury will present their picks for the film festival ’ s top awards .
dw-world spoke with the new york film distributor and movie theater owner . dan talbot came to the movies by way of collecting stamps .
as a young boy growing up in new york , he owned colorful editions from such far-away places as france , china and zanzibar .
“ i think that was the beginning , ” the 77-year-old says during a conversation with dw-world in the berlinale ’ s vip lounge .
“ it ignited my imagination about the outside world . ” talbot became a regular movie goer and re-enacted scenes on the street with his friends .
much later , he ended up running the new yorker theater .
he also founded new yorker films and became a leading importer of foreign productions , bringing the work of german director rainer werner fassbinder to an american audience , among others .
talbot now owns lincoln plaza cinemas , one of the city ’ s premier venues for foreign and independent movies . power in his hands for ten days , however , he has taken a break from his regular duties to join the jury at this year ’ s berlinale .
it ’ s a relatively novel role for talbot , who says he only sat on one other jury at a film festival before . “ i love it , but it ’ s a lot of work , ” talbot says , adding that he ’ s watching at least three films a day .
“ seeing a movie as a juror is very different from seeing it as a distributor .
as a distributor i make professional judgements .
here , i have the responsibility of giving out awards .
i don ’ t like to have power in my hands , but that ’ s what ’ s happening . ” has he walked out of a screening so far ?
“ i ’ m not going to answer that , ” talbot says and smiles .
despite his schedule as a jury member , talbot still tries to catch a few other movies on the side .
“ i feel like a farmer going to market , looking for good stuff , ” he says , wearing a “ film farmer ’ s ” all-black outfit with orange and purple festival badges as the only spots of color . bringing lenin to new york while searching for new stuff , talbot has already lined up another movie for his theater .
he ’ ll be showing german blockbuster “ good bye , lenin ! , ” a comedy about a young man who conceals the fall of the berlin wall from his ailing mother .
the movie failed to gain an oscar nomination for best foreign film this year , but talbot still believes that it will find its american audience .
“ it ’ s a very german story , but i think it transcends its germanness , ” he says .
“ it ’ s a human story .
so many people ’ s lives were affected by the wall . ” then time ’ s up .
after two press interviews , talbot gets ready to head back to the festival when he ’ s told that the next team of journalists is waiting with questions .
“ another interview , ” he asks , almost in disbelief .

american military specialists are in poland , bulgaria and romania this week scouting out potential sites for military installations . the teams will examine airfields , ports and training facilities and report on their potential for transformation into advance sites for the u.s. military , according to a newspaper report confirmed by a military spokesman to dw-world .
the installations will provide bare-bones accomodations and short-term training possiblities for u.s. troops in the coming years .
their locations in eastern europe are part of a long-term shift of military personnel away from cold war fronts like europe to new hotspots in the middle east and africa .
" there will be consolidations and re-organizations , " said a spokesman at the u.s. european military command in stuttgart .
" that will mean there are facilites that we no longer need . "
topping the list are bases in germany that the u.s. army has occupied ever since the end of wwii .
officials are careful not to say which bases might face closure and emphasize that any movement will take place gradually .
german defense minister peter struck told reporters at the nato security conference over the weekend that a decision would be made in 2004 .
towns worried about base closures news of the potential closures have caused jitters in german towns that have housed the bases for decades and have had millions of euros pumped into their local economies .
struck tried to soothe frayed nerves by saying that the u.s. government had agreed to keep germany informed of any moves they make .
military officials insist there wo n't be a wholesale shift east .
the military has invested a lot of money in many of their major bases in germany in recent years and soldiers ' families are at home in germany .
but the country 's strict environmental regulations have made it difficult for the u.s. military to find places to train , and the distance from future flash points in central asia and africa are considerable .
smaller , bare-bone sites " around 84 percent of our u.s. forces are mostly in germany and central europe and that is not necessarily where the security problem is anymore , " u.s. general charles wald , the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe told dw-world in an interview last year .
" the security problem is generating itself further to the east and further to the south . "
romania , bulgaria and poland have already expressed an interest in hosting the u.s. military .
the potential plan is to set up small " forward operating sites " or " forward operating locations " in those countries that could host anything from airstrips to training facilities .
the pentagon also wants the size of the military reduced and increase its mobility .
the base re-alignment and closure program foresees a cut in 20 percent excess base capacity at a savings of $ 6.3 billion annually , according to the pentagon . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world interviews the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles f. wald .

for some of them foreign deployments lead to pschological problems . for an increasing number of u.s. soldiers , their presence in iraq is turning into a trauma .
recently , pentagon doctor william winkenwerder acknowledged that over 400 soldiers have had to be pulled out of the country due to psychological problems .
the u.s. army is also concerned about the growing number of suicides .
since the official end of combat in may , at least 21 u.s. soldiers have taken their own lives . experts agree that foreign deployments present an enormous strain on soldiers .
eleven soldiers have committed suicide since germany 's army , the bundeswehr , started foreign deployments in 1990 , the defense ministry told dw-world .
while the numbers remain low , preventive measures have failed to halt the increase in soldiers whose mental health is adversely affected by missions abroad , the ministry contended . the duration , the growing number of foreign deployments and the " increase in traumatic experiences " all contribute to the soldiers ' difficulties , 1.0 to 1.5 percent of whom suffer from mental problems .
internationally , the average is between 2.0 and 2.5 percent . " the number of unknown cases is even greater , " said marcus garbers , head of care and welfare at the bundeswehr association , which represents the interests of soldiers .
statistics only reflect part of the reality , since soldiers often do n't dare talk about mental problems .
psychologists assert that some superiors think soldiers who do n't " hold their own " are unfit . symptoms arise months later bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers bear the coffin of a comrade at the military airport in cologne in june 2003 after a suicide bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan .
despite good preparation , life in a military camp unsettles some soldiers .
in afghanistan , for example , soldiers have practically no privacy , family and friends are far away and the danger of attacks is all present .
while traumatic experiences , such as the suicide bomb attack on a german army bus in kabul in june 2003 , are rare , they ca n't be ruled out . the attack , which killed four german soldiers and injured 29 , left both physical and psychological scars .
the victims and the people who came to their aid are still trying to come to terms with what they experienced . mental problems often arise months after foreign missions have concluded .
post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- appears as panic attacks , a racing pulse , dizziness and diarrhea , as well as aggression , a feeling of emptiness and frustration .
if untreated , ptsd can continue for decades .
fifteen years after the end of the vietnam war , 250,000 u.s. veterans still suffered from ptsd , according to the german reservist magazine loyal . family problems the bundeswehr association also says that foreign deployments wreak havoc on relationships .
divorces and separations have increased .
" more and more soldiers are calling who complain about family problems after foreign deployments , " garbers said . the bundeswehr institute for social sciences -lrb- sowi -rrb- confirmed that that was the case in a 2002 study that remains classified .
a survey of nato soldiers in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- showed that 15 percent of partnerships had broken up .
very young soldiers with loose partnerships are usually the worst affected , the defense ministry stressed .
but the authors of the sowi study wrote that there was " no reason to be alarmed . "
they assumed that the " quality of marriages suffers as a result of the deployment , without an actual separation taking place . " that 's why garbers has called for soldiers to be sent abroad for four rather than six months , which he said defense minister peter struck has also publicly declared his aim .
but the defense ministry remains reserved .
" a reorientation of the contingent duration is currently being examined , " it told dw-world . steffen leidel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hands over peacekeeping reins to canada german general götz gliemeroth handed over command of the nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan to canada on monday amid fresh security concerns following an emergence of suicide bomb attacks .

an overwhelming majority of french parliamentarians voted to ban conspicuous religious symbols in state-run schools tuesday .
the law , which is sure to be passed by the senate , will be effective next school year . conspicuous religious symbols have no place in state-run schools , according to french president jacques chirac .
after months of debate on whether muslim headscarves compromise france 's strict form of secularism , 494 parliamentarians in france 's lower house ascribed to chirac 's view when they voted tuesday in favor of a ban on muslim headscarves , jewish skull caps and large crucifixes from state schools . only 36 parliamentarians from the green and communist parties opposed the controversial legislation , which they said discriminated against muslims . " what is at issue here is the clear affirmation that public school is a place for learning and not for militant activity or proselytism , " parliamentary speaker jean-louis debré , a member of the governing ump , said . the bill will move on to the senate for debate in march and then return to the lower house of parliament for final approval , which is now only a formality .
it will take effect by september , the beginning of the new school year , when students at france 's schools and universities will only be allowed to wear discreet signs of their religions , such as small pendants and crosses . the law will initially be in place for one year , after which it will be reviewed . protests from ethnic minorities , teachers polls show that nearly 70 percent of the french public support the bill as apposed to only around 40 percent of the country 's 5 million muslims . muslims and evven sikhs - who fear they will be prohibited from wearing turbans - have staged numerous demonstrations in past weeks against the bill .
religious leaders have warned the bill will have negative fallouts . the french council of muslims published an open letter warning against creating a law that would discriminate against muslims . france 's head rabbi , joseph sitruk criticized that the ban would prevent successful religious integration . " this will not solve the problem , " lhaj thami breze , president of the large union of french islamic organisations -lrb- uoif -rrb- told reuters .
" who will decide what 's conspicuous and what 's not ? " he said the uoif would urge schoolgirls to opt for discreet head gear such as bandannas or caps and hoped these would be accepted at school .
" it 's unfortunate that the whole nation is so preoccupied with a simple piece of cloth , " he said .
three of the country 's four teachers unions have also cautioned that the law would stigmatize students , and some muslim leaders have said they would have to open private schools for girls who are expelled from state-run ones . separation between church and state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president jacques chirac -lrb- center -rrb- is framed by french grand rabbi joseph sitruk -lrb- left -rrb- and paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur after his speech at the elysee palace in paris on dec.17 in which chirac said he would ask parliament to pass a law banning islamic head scarves and other religious insignia in public schools .
in a speech on the subject in december , president chirac recalled the fundaments of french republicanism that require the state to remain neutral in religious questions .
secularism has a been a basic principle of french thought since 1905 , when church and state were officially separated . in recent years , headscarves have been a recurring , divisive issue in numerous european countries . last year , germany 's highest court ruled that school authorities in stuttgart had been wrong to bar a muslim woman from a teaching job because she insisted on wearing a headscarf in the classroom .
but the court also stated that , although germany 's constitution did n't forbid wearing headscarves in state-run schools , individual states were free to impose such bans . since the ruling , politicians in seven of germany 's 16 states have said they would draft bills , which , if passed , would prohibit teachers from wearing headscarves in state-run schools . dw staff with material from news agencies -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de headscarf debate divides the nation the discussion on the muslim headscarf is becoming increasingly tainted by ideology , and not only in germany and france .

reports being presented at a un-led intergovernmental conference on biodiversity are highlighting damaging fishing practices , over-fishing and the lack of protection for the high seas .
campaigners say three quarters of the world 's seas are over fished however , some western governments attending are expected to resist extending environmental laws and conservation areas to cover international waters .
the planet 's oceans are worth almost $ 80bn a year to the world economy in terms of fishing alone .
but according to environmental campaigners , only around 0.5 % of their area is protected - and that protection , they say , is under-funded .
reports out from groups including the wwf -lrb- world wildlife fund -rrb- and the natural resources defence council say that seabed trawling - where heavy chains , nets and steel plates are dragged along the sea floor - is devastating marine habitats .
yet they say very few fish are caught this way so stopping it would have little economic impact .
campaigners also reckon that three-quarters of the world 's seas are over fished yet they estimate $ 20bn a year are given to fishing fleets in subsidies .
they are calling for some of that money to be channelled instead into conservation .
the cost is not just being counted in terms of species lost .
given that almost half of the anti-cancer drugs currently under test are said to have marine origins , campaigners say we would be losing the medicines of the future .
however , environmentalists are expecting some resistance from governments who fear that moves at the conference to protect international waters could harm their fishing industries .

under the proposals , jail terms for criminal damage would go up from 10 to 14 years , and judges would take into account racial and religious factors when sentencing .
criminal justice minister john spellar said the measures were overdue .
" i am putting forward plans to increase maximum sentences for certain offences , giving judges greater powers in sentencing where aggravation is proven , " he said .
" this will give judges crucial powers to hand down sentences which fit the seriousness of the crime . "
the new plans would require judges to take into account any racial , religious or sexual orientation factors when sentencing .
i am putting forward plans to increase maximum sentences for certain offences , giving judges greater powers in sentencing where aggravation is proven john spellar criminal justice minister sentencing powers where violent attacks are connected to so-called hate crimes would also increase .
the consultation paper has been published amid a major new attempt by the police to end the campaign of intimidation and violence directed against vulnerable communities in the province .
attacks against ethnic minorities have risen by around 40 % in the last year , with many families being forced to leave their homes in south belfast .
last week , the loyalist paramilitary group the ulster volunteer force said it has " stood down " its leader in the village area after a spate of racist attacks in the area .
mr spellar said the new legislation would empower the courts to hand down stiffer sentences to offenders .
" i am putting forward plans to increase maximum sentences for certain offences , giving judges greater powers in sentencing where aggravation is proven , " he said .
" this will give judges crucial powers to hand down sentences which fit the seriousness of the crime . "
anti-racism training homophobes and bigots also face longer prison sentences under the draft criminal justice -lrb- ni -rrb- order .
patrick yu , head of the northern ireland council for ethnic minorities said the plans would be worthless unless those behind such attacks were caught " we do n't have confidence in the whole criminal justice system if no one is prosecuted .
" there are cases with strong evidence but the director of public prosecution drops them without any reason .
" what we need to do is put more of these people in jail . "
even though he welcomed the government initiative , mr yu insisted it was only part of a solution .

the consultation paper has been published amid a major new attempt by the police to end the campaign of intimidation and violence directed against vulnerable communities in the province .
attacks against ethnic minorities have risen by around 40 % in the last year , with many families being forced to leave their homes in south belfast .

patrick yu , head of the northern ireland council for ethnic minorities said the plans would be worthless unless those behind such attacks were caught " we do n't have confidence in the whole criminal justice system if no one is prosecuted .
" there are cases with strong evidence but the director of public prosecution drops them without any reason .
" what we need to do is put more of these people in jail . "
even though he welcomed the government initiative , mr yu insisted it was only part of a solution .
" we also need the police to secure good evidence , " he suggested .
" not all police officers are sympathetic to the needs of ethnic minorities , so there needs to be more anti-racism training . "

diana ross shot to fame as the leader of girl group the supremes in the 1960s .
signed to the soul label motown , the supremes were formed with mary wilson , barbara martin and florence ballard as the primettes in 1959 .
after martin 's departure , the supremes went on to become one of the biggest groups of the decade , scoring 12 number one hits .
in 1967 they changed their name to diana ross and the supremes - there was no guessing as to who had control in the group .
after 1969 's someday we 'll be together , ross left the group , embarking on a solo career .
the 1970s started in style with the release of the evergreen soul classic ai n't no mountain high enough , then with her starring role as billie holiday in the 1972 film lady sings the blues .
rumour ross -lrb- right -rrb- with cindy birdsong and mary wilson in 1970 the 1970s also saw her duetting with marvin gaye on an album , starring in more films such as mahogany and the musical the wiz , also starring a young michael jackson - who she was rumoured to have had an affair with .
she also created column inches thanks to her affair with gene simmons , the bass player from glam rock group kiss .
in 1981 she scored the biggest hit of her career , the lionel richie duet endless love , starting a decade which saw her chart with the slick muscles and chain reaction , produced by the bee gees .
ross married arne naess , a norwegian shipping magnate , in 1986 following rumours she was to wed motown founder berry gordy .
acrimony film star : ross in the late 1970s in 1994 she famously opened the football world cup in the us , fluffing a penalty in full view of the world 's television viewers .
her marriage to naess petered out in 1999 , and she made headlines after allegedly assaulting a female flight attendant at london 's heathrow airport after the attendant had tried to conduct a body search before she boarded her flight .
she returned to the us after being cautioned by police .
ross later described her experience as a " day of total humiliation " .
a year later a supremes tour with ross as the only original member - her relationship with the others having dissolved into acrimony - folded after disappointing ticket sales .
in 2002 , ross booked into a rehabilitation clinic in california to deal with long-running battles with drug and alcohol addiction .
in december 2002 she was arrested after a motorist reported a swerving vehicle on roads in tucson , arizona .
ross was later charged with drink-driving .
last year , she announced she was writing her memoirs , which would include details of her arrest , and the disastrous supremes " reunion " tour .
the book - upside down : wrong turns , right turns and the road ahead - is due out later this year .

there was an enormous level of expectation surrounding the performance of the tempest at covent garden - and not just because it was a rare world première of a new work at the opera house .
adès was hailed as a musical prodigy critics and audiences alike were eager to discover if the enormous hype and potential of the composer thomas adès is to be fully realised .
the 32-year-old is a composer of the highest standard - of that there is no disagreement among the critics .
" tom must know that with all the attention he has had , this is make or break , " composer robin holloway , a former teacher of adès , told the financial times .
to give an idea of the expectation it is worth recapping the fulsome praise lavished on the man in recent years .
he has been described as " the youngest living composer of world repute " , " potentially the first composer of the third millennium " and " the great bear in the british musical constellation " .
and all that in just one article .
over-praising over-praising british composers is common among critics - in the early 1990s the world 's music press queued up to laud adès as " the new mozart " - and many young composers have failed to meet expected promise .
born in highgate , north london in 1971 to an intellectual , middle-class family , he studied music at the guildhall school and king 's college , cambridge .
the royal opera is the venue for the tempest he first made an impact as a pianist , coming second in the piano class of the bbc 's young musician of the year competition in 1989 .
he started composing " seriously " - producing his first chamber symphony aged 18 - and pieces such as five eliot landscapes , living toys and these premises are alarmed were praised for their originality .
but it was his controversial chamber opera powder her face , written aged 24 , and the tone poem asyla , commissioned for the birmingham symphony and given its première under sir simon rattle , which brought him to a wider audience .
exhausting quavers asyla was even shortlisted for the mercury music prize .
the compliments duly followed , like 1,000 exhausting quavers on a score .
he was described as the most prodigious musical talent to appear in the uk since benjamin britten .
but since 1999 his output has been less explosively received as his role as artistic director of the aldeburgh festival began and as he started work on the royal opera house commission , which has been written in a relatively hurried two years .
his career rise had been meteoric , but some critics felt his work was a touch " flashy " - one critic described one of his pieces as " shallow sophistication " .
he has also had a strained relationship with the media and has done few interviews since he was " misrepresented " in an article .
by then he had been labelled by some as a little too eager to " sound off " about his own talents and the lack of talents in others .
even before its premiere , the tempest was expected to be both original and controversial .
original because adès ' music has never been anything less than startlingly fresh and controversial because adapting shakespeare is never a painless process .

there was an enormous level of expectation surrounding the performance of the tempest at covent garden on tuesday - and not just because it is a rare world première of a new work at the opera house .
critics and audiences alike were eager to discover if the enormous hype and potential of the composer thomas adès is to be fully realised .
the 32-year-old is a composer of the highest standard - of that there is no disagreement among the critics .
" tom must know that with all the attention he has had , this is make or break , " composer robin holloway , a former teacher of adès , told the financial times .
to give an idea of the expectation it is worth recapping the fulsome praise lavished on the man in recent years .
he has been described as " the youngest living composer of world repute " , " potentially the first composer of the third millennium " and " the great bear in the british musical constellation " .
and all that in just one article .
over-praising over-praising british composers is common among critics - in the early 1990s the world 's music press queued up to laud adès as " the new mozart " - and many young composers have failed to meet expected promise .
born in highgate , north london in 1971 to an intellectual , middle-class family , he studied music at the guildhall school and king 's college , cambridge .
he first made an impact as a pianist , coming second in the piano class of the bbc 's young musician of the year competition in 1989 .
he started composing " seriously " - producing his first chamber symphony aged 18 - and pieces such as five eliot landscapes , living toys and these premises are alarmed were praised for their originality .
but it was his controversial chamber opera powder her face , written aged 24 , and the tone poem asyla , commissioned for the birmingham symphony and given its première under sir simon rattle , which brought him to a wider audience .
exhausting quavers asyla was even shortlisted for the mercury music prize .
the compliments duly followed , like 1,000 exhausting quavers on a score .
he was described as the most prodigious musical talent to appear in the uk since benjamin britten .
but since 1999 his output has been less explosively received as his role as artistic director of the aldeburgh festival began and as he started work on the royal opera house commission , which has been written in a relatively hurried two years .
his career rise had been meteoric , but some critics felt his work was a touch " flashy " - one critic described one of his pieces as " shallow sophistication " .
he has also had a strained relationship with the media and has done few interviews since he was " misrepresented " in an article .
by then he had been labelled by some as a little too eager to " sound off " about his own talents and the lack of talents in others .
even before its premiere , the tempest was expected to be both original and controversial .
original because adès ' music has never been anything less than startlingly fresh and controversial because adapting shakespeare is never a painless process .
