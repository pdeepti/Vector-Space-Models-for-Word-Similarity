the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .

the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .
for the rest , employees would be offered early retirement or voluntary redundancies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .
the dissolution of the commission in its current form would " be completed by the year 2010 . "

indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .
" i 'm sure the appeals court will clear him fully , " pecorella told afp news agency . a waste of time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor ilda boccassini " it 's a verdict which is largely satisfactory , which brings to an end a 10-year case which has been shown to be substantially useless , " another member of berlusconi 's legal team , niccolo ghedini , said . " it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .
the trials were split so as not to interfere with berlusoni 's commitments as prime minister . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a case of cosi fan tutte in brussels ?

defending herself against critics , kroes said that " a couple of people suggested that i would hold back … that i wouldn ’ t take tough action against businesses that violate the competition rules because i was too close to business interests … and that i would be some kind of pussycat .
the decisions -lsb- taken today -rsb- are hard evidence to the contrary … i promised that i would blow the whistle when needed and today i have put that into practice . "
the commission blocked the proposed acquisition of portugal ’ s state-owned gas company gdp by its main electricity company edp and italian energy company eni , saying the merger would have " resulted in higher prices for portuguese consumers and industrial users .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .

the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .

after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .
roche is an award-winning viva star .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .
" i 'm sure the appeals court will clear him fully , " pecorella told afp news agency . a waste of time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor ilda boccassini " it 's a verdict which is largely satisfactory , which brings to an end a 10-year case which has been shown to be substantially useless , " another member of berlusconi 's legal team , niccolo ghedini , said . " it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .
the trials were split so as not to interfere with berlusoni 's commitments as prime minister . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a case of cosi fan tutte in brussels ?

current un secretary general kofi annan hopes to complete a reform of the council in 2005 . considering two models last week , a un commission suggested two possible new models for the council .

current un secretary general kofi annan hopes to complete a reform of the council in 2005 . considering two models last week , a un commission suggested two possible new models for the council .
one of these would expand the council by six new permanent and three temporary members , the second would add nine temporary members .
but until now , neither model had included a veto right for the new members . the current security council members are china , france , great britain , russia and the united states . speaking at an economic forum in tokyo , schröder once again stressed germany 's desire to get a seat on the new council , adding that any expansion must take into account developing nations and countries with emerging democracies . but while on the one hand " the global importance of important southern countries need to be taken into account , " the same is true for industrial nations , " which have done so much to help finance the work toward world piece and international security . " suggesting expansion germany has already struck an agreement with japan , brazil and india to mutually support one another in their attempts to gain a seat on the new council .
in tokyo , schröder now suggested to expand the group to include africa . " i hope we can also add two african countries to this initiative , " he said . also during the visit , schröder said he would welcome a japanese presence in the afghanistan province of kunduz , where the german army has a reconstruction team . germany would be " happy to have a successful cooperation outside of kabul , in kunduz province , within the scope of the reconstruction we are currently engaged in , " schröder said . japan is among the largest financial backers in afghanistan reconstruction projects . the northern afghan province of kunduz is the site of the first german reconstruction team .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .
" i 'm sure the appeals court will clear him fully , " pecorella told afp news agency . a waste of time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor ilda boccassini " it 's a verdict which is largely satisfactory , which brings to an end a 10-year case which has been shown to be substantially useless , " another member of berlusconi 's legal team , niccolo ghedini , said . " it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .
the trials were split so as not to interfere with berlusoni 's commitments as prime minister . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a case of cosi fan tutte in brussels ?

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.12.2004 germany embraces the ' other ' football großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin -lrb- left -rrb- and frankfurt have been the league 's most successful teams the nfl europe last month made germany the continental stronghold of the sport by adding a fifth team .
the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "
pressure to perform owners have been pleased with the way in which nfl europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. louis rams quaterback kurt warner , right , played a few seasons in the nfl europe before going on to win a super bowl with st. louis has developed players like super bowl quarterbacks brad johnson and kurt warner -lrb- photo -rrb- , and pro bowl players like la 'roi glover of the oakland raiders .
but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .
" i 'd like to see more teams from different countries , " he said .
" it 's kind of unfortunate you 'll have just german teams playing against one another rather than an english team , spanish team or italian team .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially .

the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .

kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.12.2004 germany embraces the ' other ' football großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin -lrb- left -rrb- and frankfurt have been the league 's most successful teams the nfl europe last month made germany the continental stronghold of the sport by adding a fifth team .
the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "
pressure to perform owners have been pleased with the way in which nfl europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. louis rams quaterback kurt warner , right , played a few seasons in the nfl europe before going on to win a super bowl with st. louis has developed players like super bowl quarterbacks brad johnson and kurt warner -lrb- photo -rrb- , and pro bowl players like la 'roi glover of the oakland raiders .
but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .

munich have a tough match with third place stuttgart ; schalke host lowly freiburg .
who 'll finish as " winter champs ? " the first half of the 2004/2005 bundesliga season has seen its share of surprises - some pleasant , some not .
wolfsburg led the league more than half of the time but have faded of late .
the promoted sides mainz , nuremberg and bielefeld all have played better than average soccer , doing what they have to do to retain their position in germany 's top division .
on the flip side , traditional clubs like dortmund , kaiserslautern and mönchengladbach are struggling to avoid relegation .
everyone measures themselves against bayern but when all is said and done , everyone turns their attention to bayern munich .
level on points with schalke 04 , felix magath 's side host third place stuttgart on saturday .
with a victory , munich will assure themselves of spending the winter break at the top of the standings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath has had a successful hand in munich .
magath plays down the importance of the ' winter championship , ' but admits that it is " psychologically important . "
in the online magazine kicker , goalkeeper oliver kahn added that " -lrb- it -rrb- is definitely an advantage if you are in first place at the winter break . "
stuttgart has a score to settle with their ex-coach magath .
the two clubs met a month ago in a german cup match which bayern handily won , 3-0 .
since their departure from that competition , stuttgart have won three of four bundesliga contests , including a 5-2 demolition of bochum last saturday .
schalke 04 have an easier task at hand .
last place freiburg -lrb- 10 points -rrb- comes to town , and the difference between the two clubs could hardly be greater at the moment .
schalke are brimming with confidence and the word " championship " is no longer taboo in gelsenkirchen .
under ralf rangnick , who took over for jupp heynckes on sept .
29 , schalke have won an impressive nine of ten bundesliga matches .
freiburg are floundering at the bottom of the standings .
they have lost four in a row , including a 6-0 shellacking at the hands of champions bremen at home last weekend .
in freiburg , the word " relegation " is no longer taboo , as if they have already accepted their fate .
berlin and hanover soaring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho -lrb- 9 goals , 9 assists -rrb- has single-handedly revived berlin .
that berlin are in the top half of the standings should not come as too great a surprise .
the team from the capital has always had talent .
hanover is another matter , though .
yet erik gerets ' club has shown little respect for the expectations of the experts and on 28 points currently hold down fourth place .
the two teams pride themselves on stingy defenses , both having only given up a league-leading 15 goals .
american steven cherundolo , one of hanover 's goal scorers in the team 's win over hamburg last weekend , says one lapse may make the difference in the match .
" i think a free kick or a corner kick , one defensive mistake could decide the game .
we need to keep their key player marcelinho under control .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "

but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .

this year was therefore the fifth year in a row that new car sales had stagnated or fallen in germany , vda said .

there were no presents for us , " gottschalk complained .
to meet sluggish demand , carmakers in germany have embarked on drastic belt-tightening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.12.2004 music television without music großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trash instead of culture goodbye visual music culture !
following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .

indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .
" regional conflicts and international terrorism can only be tackled by a multilateral approach .

speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics .

german consumer protection minister renate künast also said her countrymen were watching too much television and exercising to little , adding that only marathon runners actually required the amount of energy intake many germans consume . the report had some positive news , however : with 1.43 hours set aside for meals each day , germans spend 21 minutes more on eating than a decade ago .

indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .
" regional conflicts and international terrorism can only be tackled by a multilateral approach . " dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks un veto parity on a visit to tokyo , german chancellor gerhard schröder pushed talk over un security council restructuring to a new level by demanding a veto right for any new member .

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.12.2004 germany embraces the ' other ' football großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin -lrb- left -rrb- and frankfurt have been the league 's most successful teams the nfl europe last month made germany the continental stronghold of the sport by adding a fifth team .
the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "
pressure to perform owners have been pleased with the way in which nfl europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. louis rams quaterback kurt warner , right , played a few seasons in the nfl europe before going on to win a super bowl with st. louis has developed players like super bowl quarterbacks brad johnson and kurt warner -lrb- photo -rrb- , and pro bowl players like la 'roi glover of the oakland raiders .
but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .
" i 'd like to see more teams from different countries , " he said .
" it 's kind of unfortunate you 'll have just german teams playing against one another rather than an english team , spanish team or italian team .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future .

" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .

" a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .

but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .
" i 'd like to see more teams from different countries , " he said .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .

apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .

after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .
roche is an award-winning viva star .
but despite her ongoing contracts , she last week entered a strike .
she therefore pre-empted the end of her show " fast forward , " which viva plans to discontinue at the end of the year .
the music television project , which started on aug .
1 , 1981 with the legendary first mtv video of the buggles ' " video killed the radio star " should perhaps end with a single by the band the libertines : " i no longer hear the music . "
and although the song is actually about something totally different , it fits perfectly . marcus bösch -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva mtv owner viacom has announced it will buy a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market .
-lrb- june 28 , 2004 -rrb- german reality shows in need of reality check reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .
roche is an award-winning viva star .
but despite her ongoing contracts , she last week entered a strike .
she therefore pre-empted the end of her show " fast forward , " which viva plans to discontinue at the end of the year .
the music television project , which started on aug .
1 , 1981 with the legendary first mtv video of the buggles ' " video killed the radio star " should perhaps end with a single by the band the libertines : " i no longer hear the music . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.12.2004 suicide letters a german bestseller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide letters have become popular reading material in germany suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open . when pop culture takes on the issue of suicide , the results can be controversial .
just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?

germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .
the dissolution of the commission in its current form would " be completed by the year 2010 . "
over 180 kilometers of files are in the stasi archive and would end up in the federal archive in koblenz .
the culture ministry would then take over the educational and research functions that birthler 's commission now oversee and then pass them on to the ministry 's own stiftung aufarbeitung foundation or other modern history research institutions according to the strategy paper .
only one of many options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss in response to the possible dissolution of the commission , weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- said to the berliner zeitung it was only one concept of many that were being discussed in the ministry regarding the future of the commission when her office assumes control of it .
her deputy responsible for the strategy paper , knut nevermann , did not confer with her about the proposed the details , such as the possible dissolution date of 2010 .
regarding the transfer from the interior to the culture ministry , birthler said she had not been informed of it before the announcement last week .
" the culture minister assured me that there will be an open discussion about the long-term perspectives of those institutions that deal with the injustices of the sed state , " birthler told the newspaper after having spoken with weiss .
the stasi commissioner also wrote a letter to the parliament , reminding the lawmakers that they must make any decisions regarding the future of the files and the commission .
the now public internal discussions have come somewhat as a surprise .
only last week weiss had said in a press release that " the original contribution of the commission , to store , administer and make accessible the files of the ministry for state security would be supported in the future .

only one of many options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss in response to the possible dissolution of the commission , weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- said to the berliner zeitung it was only one concept of many that were being discussed in the ministry regarding the future of the commission when her office assumes control of it .
her deputy responsible for the strategy paper , knut nevermann , did not confer with her about the proposed the details , such as the possible dissolution date of 2010 .
regarding the transfer from the interior to the culture ministry , birthler said she had not been informed of it before the announcement last week .
" the culture minister assured me that there will be an open discussion about the long-term perspectives of those institutions that deal with the injustices of the sed state , " birthler told the newspaper after having spoken with weiss .
the stasi commissioner also wrote a letter to the parliament , reminding the lawmakers that they must make any decisions regarding the future of the files and the commission .
the now public internal discussions have come somewhat as a surprise .
only last week weiss had said in a press release that " the original contribution of the commission , to store , administer and make accessible the files of the ministry for state security would be supported in the future .

" a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .
for the rest , employees would be offered early retirement or voluntary redundancies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?
germany produces some 5.5 million cars every year , but the german car industry is most likely to remember 2004 for poor sales and industrial strikes .
can it be salvaged ?

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future .

kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .

" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .

current un secretary general kofi annan hopes to complete a reform of the council in 2005 . considering two models last week , a un commission suggested two possible new models for the council .
one of these would expand the council by six new permanent and three temporary members , the second would add nine temporary members .
but until now , neither model had included a veto right for the new members . the current security council members are china , france , great britain , russia and the united states . speaking at an economic forum in tokyo , schröder once again stressed germany 's desire to get a seat on the new council , adding that any expansion must take into account developing nations and countries with emerging democracies . but while on the one hand " the global importance of important southern countries need to be taken into account , " the same is true for industrial nations , " which have done so much to help finance the work toward world piece and international security . " suggesting expansion germany has already struck an agreement with japan , brazil and india to mutually support one another in their attempts to gain a seat on the new council .
in tokyo , schröder now suggested to expand the group to include africa . " i hope we can also add two african countries to this initiative , " he said . also during the visit , schröder said he would welcome a japanese presence in the afghanistan province of kunduz , where the german army has a reconstruction team . germany would be " happy to have a successful cooperation outside of kabul , in kunduz province , within the scope of the reconstruction we are currently engaged in , " schröder said . japan is among the largest financial backers in afghanistan reconstruction projects . the northern afghan province of kunduz is the site of the first german reconstruction team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.12.2004 resistance to schröder 's calls for un veto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the structure of the un security council could soon get a facelift chancellor gerhard schröder 's appeal to the united nations to grant the power of veto to any new permanent security council member could have done berlin 's bid more harm than good . the chancellor joined forces with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in calling on the council to reconsider current reform recommendations , under which any new permanent members would not receive the power of veto held by the existing five seat-holders , china , france , great britain , russia and the united states . but one un diplomat said that germany 's chances two months ago were better than they are now , and that berlin should play a little more carefully .
indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .
" regional conflicts and international terrorism can only be tackled by a multilateral approach .

indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .
" regional conflicts and international terrorism can only be tackled by a multilateral approach .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .
the dissolution of the commission in its current form would " be completed by the year 2010 . "
over 180 kilometers of files are in the stasi archive and would end up in the federal archive in koblenz .
the culture ministry would then take over the educational and research functions that birthler 's commission now oversee and then pass them on to the ministry 's own stiftung aufarbeitung foundation or other modern history research institutions according to the strategy paper .
only one of many options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss in response to the possible dissolution of the commission , weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- said to the berliner zeitung it was only one concept of many that were being discussed in the ministry regarding the future of the commission when her office assumes control of it .
her deputy responsible for the strategy paper , knut nevermann , did not confer with her about the proposed the details , such as the possible dissolution date of 2010 .
regarding the transfer from the interior to the culture ministry , birthler said she had not been informed of it before the announcement last week .
" the culture minister assured me that there will be an open discussion about the long-term perspectives of those institutions that deal with the injustices of the sed state , " birthler told the newspaper after having spoken with weiss .
the stasi commissioner also wrote a letter to the parliament , reminding the lawmakers that they must make any decisions regarding the future of the files and the commission .
the now public internal discussions have come somewhat as a surprise .
only last week weiss had said in a press release that " the original contribution of the commission , to store , administer and make accessible the files of the ministry for state security would be supported in the future .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .

i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .
roche is an award-winning viva star .
but despite her ongoing contracts , she last week entered a strike .
she therefore pre-empted the end of her show " fast forward , " which viva plans to discontinue at the end of the year .
the music television project , which started on aug .
1 , 1981 with the legendary first mtv video of the buggles ' " video killed the radio star " should perhaps end with a single by the band the libertines : " i no longer hear the music . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.12.2004 suicide letters a german bestseller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide letters have become popular reading material in germany suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open . when pop culture takes on the issue of suicide , the results can be controversial .
just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "

indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .
" regional conflicts and international terrorism can only be tackled by a multilateral approach .

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .
" i 'm sure the appeals court will clear him fully , " pecorella told afp news agency . a waste of time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor ilda boccassini " it 's a verdict which is largely satisfactory , which brings to an end a 10-year case which has been shown to be substantially useless , " another member of berlusconi 's legal team , niccolo ghedini , said . " it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .

" i 've had several talks with jörg haider and have the feeling that he 's interested in this cooperation , " he said .
" i 'm proposing to jörg haider that he be the top candidate of our movement .

the problem lies in the wording , which the culture minister would have pay tribute to the half million " gypsies " murdered by the nazis .
a suggestions which has been met with abject resistance . " our fate has always been a footnote to the extermination of the jews , but we were exposed to the same systematic will to destroy us , " council chairman romani rose told the reuters news agency . rose accused the german government of " systematic delaying tactics " , but a spokesman for culture minister christina weiss rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose at the site of the proposed memorial near the german parliament building , which can be seen in the background " the memorial has been financed and planned , and we want it , " the spokesman said , adding that the inscription should include all groups who suffered at the hands of the nazis , not only the roma and sinti . citing the president what the council is calling for is the use of a quote by former german president , roman herzog , in which the suffering of the roma and sinti is equated to that of the jews .
they want it made plain that their suffering was the result of the same racial hatred . but the culture minister spokesman expressed some concerns over the former president 's statement . " historians also see differences between the persecution of the jews and that of the sinti and roma , making it problematic to present them as equal , " he said . but romani rose said they council would not accept the proposed wording , which he said also proved the culture ministry 's lack of respect and ignorance about the sinti and roma holocaust victims . a survivor of the holocaust , 81-year-old reinhard florian , also said he was opposed to the word " gypsies . " " i do n't want to see this word on our monument , as soon as i hear it i think of the old times and of the ss , " he told the reuters news agency . six million jews were murdered in the holocaust , but other persecuted groups included homosexuals , conscientious objectors , communists and jehovah 's witnesses . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating europe 's maligned minority berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently opened the german capital 's first ever festival for sinti and roma culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.12.2004 resistance to schröder 's calls for un veto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the structure of the un security council could soon get a facelift chancellor gerhard schröder 's appeal to the united nations to grant the power of veto to any new permanent security council member could have done berlin 's bid more harm than good . the chancellor joined forces with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in calling on the council to reconsider current reform recommendations , under which any new permanent members would not receive the power of veto held by the existing five seat-holders , china , france , great britain , russia and the united states . but one un diplomat said that germany 's chances two months ago were better than they are now , and that berlin should play a little more carefully .
indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .

xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .

according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.

the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .

he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .

indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .
the dissolution of the commission in its current form would " be completed by the year 2010 . "
over 180 kilometers of files are in the stasi archive and would end up in the federal archive in koblenz .
the culture ministry would then take over the educational and research functions that birthler 's commission now oversee and then pass them on to the ministry 's own stiftung aufarbeitung foundation or other modern history research institutions according to the strategy paper .
only one of many options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss in response to the possible dissolution of the commission , weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- said to the berliner zeitung it was only one concept of many that were being discussed in the ministry regarding the future of the commission when her office assumes control of it .
her deputy responsible for the strategy paper , knut nevermann , did not confer with her about the proposed the details , such as the possible dissolution date of 2010 .
regarding the transfer from the interior to the culture ministry , birthler said she had not been informed of it before the announcement last week .
" the culture minister assured me that there will be an open discussion about the long-term perspectives of those institutions that deal with the injustices of the sed state , " birthler told the newspaper after having spoken with weiss .
the stasi commissioner also wrote a letter to the parliament , reminding the lawmakers that they must make any decisions regarding the future of the files and the commission .
the now public internal discussions have come somewhat as a surprise .
only last week weiss had said in a press release that " the original contribution of the commission , to store , administer and make accessible the files of the ministry for state security would be supported in the future .

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .
for the rest , employees would be offered early retirement or voluntary redundancies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .
for the rest , employees would be offered early retirement or voluntary redundancies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future .

" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "
pressure to perform owners have been pleased with the way in which nfl europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. louis rams quaterback kurt warner , right , played a few seasons in the nfl europe before going on to win a super bowl with st. louis has developed players like super bowl quarterbacks brad johnson and kurt warner -lrb- photo -rrb- , and pro bowl players like la 'roi glover of the oakland raiders .
but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .
for the rest , employees would be offered early retirement or voluntary redundancies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?
germany produces some 5.5 million cars every year , but the german car industry is most likely to remember 2004 for poor sales and industrial strikes .
can it be salvaged ?

as restructuring talks continue , opel 's works council and us parent company general motors are considering a possible merger of gm 's european subsidiaries .

munich have a tough match with third place stuttgart ; schalke host lowly freiburg .
who 'll finish as " winter champs ? " the first half of the 2004/2005 bundesliga season has seen its share of surprises - some pleasant , some not .
wolfsburg led the league more than half of the time but have faded of late .
the promoted sides mainz , nuremberg and bielefeld all have played better than average soccer , doing what they have to do to retain their position in germany 's top division .
on the flip side , traditional clubs like dortmund , kaiserslautern and mönchengladbach are struggling to avoid relegation .
everyone measures themselves against bayern but when all is said and done , everyone turns their attention to bayern munich .

with a victory , munich will assure themselves of spending the winter break at the top of the standings .

magath plays down the importance of the ' winter championship , ' but admits that it is " psychologically important . "
in the online magazine kicker , goalkeeper oliver kahn added that " -lrb- it -rrb- is definitely an advantage if you are in first place at the winter break . "
stuttgart has a score to settle with their ex-coach magath .
the two clubs met a month ago in a german cup match which bayern handily won , 3-0 .
since their departure from that competition , stuttgart have won three of four bundesliga contests , including a 5-2 demolition of bochum last saturday .
schalke 04 have an easier task at hand .
last place freiburg -lrb- 10 points -rrb- comes to town , and the difference between the two clubs could hardly be greater at the moment .
schalke are brimming with confidence and the word " championship " is no longer taboo in gelsenkirchen .

freiburg are floundering at the bottom of the standings .

dortmund have only made headlines off the field this year .
debts , management changes and quarrels with the coach .
on the field , coach bert van marwijk has failed to find a recipe to lead the club forwards .
a paltry one win in five games has sent dortmund to dangerously low depths - only three points from the drop zone .
the loss to local rival schalke on sunday only added fuel to the fire that is already burning hot at the ruhr valley club .
rostock coach jörg berger , called into save the team from relegation , summed it up for his side : " the most important thing is , is that we do n't lose too much ground going into the winter break .
we have to keep pace with the rest . "
bochum are another club currently in the relegation zone .
peter neururer 's club made it to the uefa cup last season but have failed to pick up where they left off as the successes have been far and few between .
hamburg want to wrap up the first half of the season with a win which would firmly place them in the middle of the pack .
defending champions bremen host kaiserslautern who are trying to turn things around .
bremen are not very generous to kaiserslautern , having only lost six games to the " red devils " at bremen .
this will be a test for lautern coach kurt jara 's side who have won their last two matches against weaker opponents -lrb- mainz and freiburg -rrb- .
bremen head thomas schaaf wants to see his team continue its strong play of late , capped most recently by a 2-0 win against fc valencia in a key champions league match on tuesday .
for mainz and nuremberg its the first-ever match-up in the top division .
mainz -lrb- 22 points -rrb- are a safe distance from relegation but are slowly dropping after a hot start .
mainz have yet to lose a home game this season , something nuremberg -lrb- 18 points -rrb- would surely like to change .

leverkusen have played excellently in european club competition but they are not yet hitting on all cylinders in the bundesliga .
gladbach striker oliver neuville knows this quite well .
the former leverkusen star says the opponent can be very unpredictable : " you ca n't be certain about leverkusen .
on a good day they can beat anyone , like the 3-0 win against real madrid .
then they go and lose three days late 2-0 in mainz . "
nevertheless , they have won the last two fixtures and gladbach is a very generous opponent for the team from the rhine .
not since 1989 have gladbach beaten leverkusen at home !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.12.2004 germany embraces the ' other ' football großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin -lrb- left -rrb- and frankfurt have been the league 's most successful teams the nfl europe last month made germany the continental stronghold of the sport by adding a fifth team .
the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "
pressure to perform owners have been pleased with the way in which nfl europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. louis rams quaterback kurt warner , right , played a few seasons in the nfl europe before going on to win a super bowl with st. louis has developed players like super bowl quarterbacks brad johnson and kurt warner -lrb- photo -rrb- , and pro bowl players like la 'roi glover of the oakland raiders .
but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .
" i 'd like to see more teams from different countries , " he said .
" it 's kind of unfortunate you 'll have just german teams playing against one another rather than an english team , spanish team or italian team .

current un secretary general kofi annan hopes to complete a reform of the council in 2005 . considering two models last week , a un commission suggested two possible new models for the council .
one of these would expand the council by six new permanent and three temporary members , the second would add nine temporary members .

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .
for the rest , employees would be offered early retirement or voluntary redundancies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .
for the rest , employees would be offered early retirement or voluntary redundancies . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .

" it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "
pressure to perform owners have been pleased with the way in which nfl europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. louis rams quaterback kurt warner , right , played a few seasons in the nfl europe before going on to win a super bowl with st. louis has developed players like super bowl quarterbacks brad johnson and kurt warner -lrb- photo -rrb- , and pro bowl players like la 'roi glover of the oakland raiders .
but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .
" i 'd like to see more teams from different countries , " he said .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future .

kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .
last month , the prestigious sports college in cologne , the training ground for german referees , coaches and sports managers , began offering football seminars in cooperation with the local centurions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german constantin ritzmann played in the nfl europe development programs before heading to the university of tennessee and then the buffalo bills the hope is that the measures will produce more players to follow in the footsteps of german players like constantin ritzmann -lrb- photo -rrb- , a defensive lineman currently playing with the buffalo bills in the nfl , or offensive lineman patrick venzke , who in 2001 became the first german to make an nfl team . " a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "
pressure to perform owners have been pleased with the way in which nfl europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. louis rams quaterback kurt warner , right , played a few seasons in the nfl europe before going on to win a super bowl with st. louis has developed players like super bowl quarterbacks brad johnson and kurt warner -lrb- photo -rrb- , and pro bowl players like la 'roi glover of the oakland raiders .
but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .
" i 'd like to see more teams from different countries , " he said .
" it 's kind of unfortunate you 'll have just german teams playing against one another rather than an english team , spanish team or italian team .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .

according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.

the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .

commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .
" i 'm sure the appeals court will clear him fully , " pecorella told afp news agency . a waste of time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor ilda boccassini " it 's a verdict which is largely satisfactory , which brings to an end a 10-year case which has been shown to be substantially useless , " another member of berlusconi 's legal team , niccolo ghedini , said . " it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .
the trials were split so as not to interfere with berlusoni 's commitments as prime minister . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a case of cosi fan tutte in brussels ?

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .

" it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "

the problem lies in the wording , which the culture minister would have pay tribute to the half million " gypsies " murdered by the nazis .
a suggestions which has been met with abject resistance . " our fate has always been a footnote to the extermination of the jews , but we were exposed to the same systematic will to destroy us , " council chairman romani rose told the reuters news agency . rose accused the german government of " systematic delaying tactics " , but a spokesman for culture minister christina weiss rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose at the site of the proposed memorial near the german parliament building , which can be seen in the background " the memorial has been financed and planned , and we want it , " the spokesman said , adding that the inscription should include all groups who suffered at the hands of the nazis , not only the roma and sinti . citing the president what the council is calling for is the use of a quote by former german president , roman herzog , in which the suffering of the roma and sinti is equated to that of the jews .
they want it made plain that their suffering was the result of the same racial hatred . but the culture minister spokesman expressed some concerns over the former president 's statement .

the problem lies in the wording , which the culture minister would have pay tribute to the half million " gypsies " murdered by the nazis .
a suggestions which has been met with abject resistance . " our fate has always been a footnote to the extermination of the jews , but we were exposed to the same systematic will to destroy us , " council chairman romani rose told the reuters news agency . rose accused the german government of " systematic delaying tactics " , but a spokesman for culture minister christina weiss rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose at the site of the proposed memorial near the german parliament building , which can be seen in the background " the memorial has been financed and planned , and we want it , " the spokesman said , adding that the inscription should include all groups who suffered at the hands of the nazis , not only the roma and sinti . citing the president what the council is calling for is the use of a quote by former german president , roman herzog , in which the suffering of the roma and sinti is equated to that of the jews .
they want it made plain that their suffering was the result of the same racial hatred . but the culture minister spokesman expressed some concerns over the former president 's statement . " historians also see differences between the persecution of the jews and that of the sinti and roma , making it problematic to present them as equal , " he said . but romani rose said they council would not accept the proposed wording , which he said also proved the culture ministry 's lack of respect and ignorance about the sinti and roma holocaust victims . a survivor of the holocaust , 81-year-old reinhard florian , also said he was opposed to the word " gypsies .

the problem lies in the wording , which the culture minister would have pay tribute to the half million " gypsies " murdered by the nazis .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .
the dissolution of the commission in its current form would " be completed by the year 2010 . "
over 180 kilometers of files are in the stasi archive and would end up in the federal archive in koblenz .
the culture ministry would then take over the educational and research functions that birthler 's commission now oversee and then pass them on to the ministry 's own stiftung aufarbeitung foundation or other modern history research institutions according to the strategy paper .
only one of many options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss in response to the possible dissolution of the commission , weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- said to the berliner zeitung it was only one concept of many that were being discussed in the ministry regarding the future of the commission when her office assumes control of it .
her deputy responsible for the strategy paper , knut nevermann , did not confer with her about the proposed the details , such as the possible dissolution date of 2010 .
regarding the transfer from the interior to the culture ministry , birthler said she had not been informed of it before the announcement last week .
" the culture minister assured me that there will be an open discussion about the long-term perspectives of those institutions that deal with the injustices of the sed state , " birthler told the newspaper after having spoken with weiss .
the stasi commissioner also wrote a letter to the parliament , reminding the lawmakers that they must make any decisions regarding the future of the files and the commission .
the now public internal discussions have come somewhat as a surprise .
only last week weiss had said in a press release that " the original contribution of the commission , to store , administer and make accessible the files of the ministry for state security would be supported in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.12.2004 resistance to schröder 's calls for un veto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the structure of the un security council could soon get a facelift chancellor gerhard schröder 's appeal to the united nations to grant the power of veto to any new permanent security council member could have done berlin 's bid more harm than good . the chancellor joined forces with japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in calling on the council to reconsider current reform recommendations , under which any new permanent members would not receive the power of veto held by the existing five seat-holders , china , france , great britain , russia and the united states . but one un diplomat said that germany 's chances two months ago were better than they are now , and that berlin should play a little more carefully .
indeed it would seem that this latest demand has antagonized potential supporters of schröder 's bid for a permanent security council seat . " we are against the veto for new members , but we recognize that in the current situation , it would be unrealistic to fight against the veto of the current permanent members , " peter maurer , the new swiss un ambassador told german public broadcaster ndr . a high-level panel appointed by un secretary general kofi annan has proposed two different models for reforming the council , one of which would clear the way for an additional six permanent members , but without the power of veto . banging the drum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin and tokyo have pledged to support one another germany and japan have long argued that as major economic powers and contributors to the united nations , they deserve permanent seats on the council , and ambassadors of germany 's great ambition have long been banging the drum in the international community .
germany , japan , india and brazil have already forged a four-way alliance , pledging their mutual backing for each others ' candidatures . speaking in tokyo on thursday at the end of a five-day asian tour , schröder assured germany 's support in japan 's bid for a permanent un security council seat . " a reformed security council needs to have new steady members and has to take into account the global importance of important states of the south , but this is also true for industrial countries which continue to secure world peace and international security in a major way , " schröder said . no decision yet but washington has stressed that no decision can be made about the way forward until the panel 's recommendations have been studied , and until there has been a full debate within the security council general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell " until there is a judgment made that the security council should be expanded , we are not going to make any more statements about who should be eligible , who should be the members of the expanded security council , " us secretary of state colin powell said in statement in brussels . he added that many nations who , based on their size , economic or military power or their standing in their particular region of the world , could rightfully lay claim to a permanent seat . in order for the reforms to go ahead , two-thirds of all united nations states and 15 members of the security council have to vote in favor .
speaking in tokyo , schröder voiced his certainty that none of the permanent members would use their veto to prevent the reforms , and cited the strengthening of the un as a key challenge in international politics . " this is the most important task we have ahead of us at the moment , " schröder said .
" regional conflicts and international terrorism can only be tackled by a multilateral approach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.12.2004 suicide letters a german bestseller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide letters have become popular reading material in germany suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open . when pop culture takes on the issue of suicide , the results can be controversial .
just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

the problem lies in the wording , which the culture minister would have pay tribute to the half million " gypsies " murdered by the nazis .
a suggestions which has been met with abject resistance . " our fate has always been a footnote to the extermination of the jews , but we were exposed to the same systematic will to destroy us , " council chairman romani rose told the reuters news agency . rose accused the german government of " systematic delaying tactics " , but a spokesman for culture minister christina weiss rejected the accusations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romani rose at the site of the proposed memorial near the german parliament building , which can be seen in the background " the memorial has been financed and planned , and we want it , " the spokesman said , adding that the inscription should include all groups who suffered at the hands of the nazis , not only the roma and sinti . citing the president what the council is calling for is the use of a quote by former german president , roman herzog , in which the suffering of the roma and sinti is equated to that of the jews .
they want it made plain that their suffering was the result of the same racial hatred . but the culture minister spokesman expressed some concerns over the former president 's statement . " historians also see differences between the persecution of the jews and that of the sinti and roma , making it problematic to present them as equal , " he said . but romani rose said they council would not accept the proposed wording , which he said also proved the culture ministry 's lack of respect and ignorance about the sinti and roma holocaust victims . a survivor of the holocaust , 81-year-old reinhard florian , also said he was opposed to the word " gypsies . " " i do n't want to see this word on our monument , as soon as i hear it i think of the old times and of the ss , " he told the reuters news agency . six million jews were murdered in the holocaust , but other persecuted groups included homosexuals , conscientious objectors , communists and jehovah 's witnesses . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating europe 's maligned minority berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently opened the german capital 's first ever festival for sinti and roma culture .

an italian court on friday dropped a key corruption charge against prime minister silvio berlusconi after a four-year trial for bribing judges . in a two-part judgment read out to a packed courtroom by the court chairman francesco castellano , berlusconi was cleared of corruption in blocking the sale of the sme food group to a rival in 1985 and given the statute of limitations on the charges of bribing judges , which date from 1991 . prosecutors had demanded the court impose the maximum eight-year jails sentence for bribing judges to block a 1985 sale of state-owned food company sme to his rival carlo de benedetti . berlusconi 's lawyer gaetano pecorella said he would appeal the statute of limitations ruling because it did not fully clear his client .
" i 'm sure the appeals court will clear him fully , " pecorella told afp news agency . a waste of time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor ilda boccassini " it 's a verdict which is largely satisfactory , which brings to an end a 10-year case which has been shown to be substantially useless , " another member of berlusconi 's legal team , niccolo ghedini , said . " it 's a verdict which gives justice to silvio berlusconi .
i hope it will help bring about a calmer and less confrontational climate between politics and the judiciary , " said deputy prime minister marco follini , a member of the christian democratic udc party in berlusconi 's center-right coalition . the statute of limitations was applied to the judge-bribing charges because the court decided to halve the period of the original statute of limitations from 15 years , in which event the 1991 date falls outside the ambit of the case . several of berlusconi 's co-accused , including his close confidant cesare previti and prominent judge renato squillante , received lengthy jail sentences in a separate trial last year , but have appealed .
the trials were split so as not to interfere with berlusoni 's commitments as prime minister . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a case of cosi fan tutte in brussels ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.12.2004 suicide letters a german bestseller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide letters have become popular reading material in germany suicide is still a taboo subject in germany , but a new anthology of suicide letters is helping to bring the subject out into the open . when pop culture takes on the issue of suicide , the results can be controversial .
just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

just in time for the holidays , a medical historian has compiled an anthology of suicide letters entitled " ich mochte jetzt schliessen " -lrb- let me finish -rrb- , which has fast become a bestseller .
in a country that did n't have a national suicide prevention program until two years ago , the book and other recent cultural offerings , including a musical depicting the life of hannelore kohl , the wife of the former german chancellor , who killed herself in 2001 , are helping to bring the issue out into the open .
but experts warn the subject - if not tackled correctly - risks being exacerbated .
breaking taboos ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannelore kohl took her own life in 2001 .
germany 's national suicide rate is officially estimated at 11,000 per year , which places the number of people who die by their own hand well above the estimated 7,000 who are killed in car accidents .
but the good news is that - on the whole - suicide rates in germany have steadily declined over the past few decades , significantly dropping in the 1980s and continuing the downward trend in the 1990s .
yet , the subject has remained largely taboo .
a catholic church ruling denying those who commit suicide burial in a church graveyard remained on the books until 1983 .
and a national suicide prevention program was not launched until 2002 , merely two years ago .
in compiling the book , historian udo grashoff , the editor , said he did not want to sensationalize suicide but make it a matter of public debate and - to some extent - prompt understanding .
" suicide is neither honorable nor scandalous , rather a normal expression breakdown which occurs in every society a thousand times a year , " he recently told der spiegel newsmagazine .
" the letters show that motives and circumstances are very multidimensional , " he added .
" and i think people are today prepared to examine the individual cases more closely , rather than categorically pass judgement . "
culture and suicide experts agree that culture , both of the highbrow and pop-culture variety , can indeed spread awareness , and help the general public recognize the warning signs and offer the right kind of support .
but , on the flip side , media coverage of suicide , books and films can have quite the opposite effect , offering an instructive lesson or justification , george fiedler , deputy director of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative , told dw-world .
thus , part of the national suicide prevention initiative 's mandate is to change the way the media and popular culture address the issue .
it aims to curb negative coverage that might prompt imitators , while helping to break taboos by filling the press with a balanced view of positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .
" on the other hand , when you do n't talk about suicide at all , then you only help re-enforce society 's taboo , " fiedler said . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing death over dependence germany is facing a new problem in its struggle with a graying population : afraid they will lose their independence , some aging germans decide to commit suicide rather than move into an elderly home .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .
the dissolution of the commission in its current form would " be completed by the year 2010 . "
over 180 kilometers of files are in the stasi archive and would end up in the federal archive in koblenz .
the culture ministry would then take over the educational and research functions that birthler 's commission now oversee and then pass them on to the ministry 's own stiftung aufarbeitung foundation or other modern history research institutions according to the strategy paper .
only one of many options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss in response to the possible dissolution of the commission , weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- said to the berliner zeitung it was only one concept of many that were being discussed in the ministry regarding the future of the commission when her office assumes control of it .
her deputy responsible for the strategy paper , knut nevermann , did not confer with her about the proposed the details , such as the possible dissolution date of 2010 .
regarding the transfer from the interior to the culture ministry , birthler said she had not been informed of it before the announcement last week .
" the culture minister assured me that there will be an open discussion about the long-term perspectives of those institutions that deal with the injustices of the sed state , " birthler told the newspaper after having spoken with weiss .
the stasi commissioner also wrote a letter to the parliament , reminding the lawmakers that they must make any decisions regarding the future of the files and the commission .
the now public internal discussions have come somewhat as a surprise .
only last week weiss had said in a press release that " the original contribution of the commission , to store , administer and make accessible the files of the ministry for state security would be supported in the future .

current un secretary general kofi annan hopes to complete a reform of the council in 2005 . considering two models last week , a un commission suggested two possible new models for the council .
one of these would expand the council by six new permanent and three temporary members , the second would add nine temporary members .
but until now , neither model had included a veto right for the new members . the current security council members are china , france , great britain , russia and the united states . speaking at an economic forum in tokyo , schröder once again stressed germany 's desire to get a seat on the new council , adding that any expansion must take into account developing nations and countries with emerging democracies . but while on the one hand " the global importance of important southern countries need to be taken into account , " the same is true for industrial nations , " which have done so much to help finance the work toward world piece and international security . " suggesting expansion germany has already struck an agreement with japan , brazil and india to mutually support one another in their attempts to gain a seat on the new council .
in tokyo , schröder now suggested to expand the group to include africa . " i hope we can also add two african countries to this initiative , " he said . also during the visit , schröder said he would welcome a japanese presence in the afghanistan province of kunduz , where the german army has a reconstruction team . germany would be " happy to have a successful cooperation outside of kabul , in kunduz province , within the scope of the reconstruction we are currently engaged in , " schröder said . japan is among the largest financial backers in afghanistan reconstruction projects . the northern afghan province of kunduz is the site of the first german reconstruction team .

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .
the lion 's share of the job cuts would be implemented by transferring employees to special employment companies co-funded by the federal labor agency .

general motors will cut up to 10,000 positions at its loss-making german unit opel , the carmarker officially announced thursday .
the biggest loser is the main plant in rüsselsheim . while earlier reports said us auto giant general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- was going to cut 9,500 jobs , german news agency dpa said the company had later raised that number to 10,000 .
the move is part of a wider € 500 million -lrb- $ 660 million -rrb- cost-cutting drive .
most of the jobs would be cut at opel 's main plant in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , personnel chief norbert küpper told employees at a works meeting there on thursday .
some 3,600 jobs would be axed at bochum in western germany and 400 positions in kaiserslautern in the southwest , he added .
" among the bad solutions - and job cuts are always a bad solution - this was the best achievable , " said the head of opel 's works council in bochum , dietmar hahn .
the head of opel 's general works council klaus franz estimated that the restructuring would cost general motors around $ 1 billion -lrb- € 753 million -rrb- .
management and unions have been negotiating a drastic cost-saving and restructuring program for weeks .
on wednesday , franz had said that the job cuts would not entail any compulsory redundancies or plant closures .
" our joint aim is for the restructuring to be socially compatible and to create fair conditions for the allocation of production capacity in europe in the future , " franz had said .

the hope : that american football 's surprising success here will keep the league around longer . as hamburg 's soccer team , hsv , finishes up its season next spring , the northern city 's newest sports addition will just be warming itself up .
beginning in april , the hamburg sea devils will become the fifth german football team to play in the nfl europe , leaving the amsterdam admirals as the lone non-teuton in the six-team american football league .
the sea devils , the reincarnation of the now-defunct scottish claymores , join the cologne centurions , rhein fire , frankfurt galaxy and berlin thunder as the remnants of an ambitious plan by the us national football league to bring american-style football to the old world .
now , league officials are hoping that germans ' surprising love affair with the american sport will reverse the league 's financial woes and allow them breathing room to wage a europe-wide launch in the future . " i think if we were starting this league today ... the model we would have used is the model we have evolved into now , concentrating more in one geographical area , " said david tossell , a league spokesman .
" we were probably guilty of spreading ourselves too thin around europe , initially . " starts and stops when the world league of american football launched in 1991 as a spring league designed to develop players for the national football league , it boasted teams on three different continents , including european teams in barcelona , frankfurt and london .
though attendance in the european stadiums averaged between 20,000 and 40,000 fans , teams in the us and canada did n't do as well and the league suspended operations in 1993 .
the league 's re-launch as the nfl europe in 1995 was bankrolled entirely by owners of nfl teams who were interested not only in the league 's player development possibilities , but also the additional marketing opportunities it offered .
barcelona , frankfurt and london kept their teams , and germany 's rhine region , amsterdam and scotland were added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frankfurt galaxy topped 36,000 in attendance in 1999 and has stayed as successful since then " they knew germany was a good market , but they did n't know that it would do that good , " said patrick kessler , who covered the nfl europe for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and is a columnist for the german-language football trade publication huddle . us affection boosts football as attendance sunk in barcelona and london , the number of fans increased in frankfurt and the rhine , hovering around 30,000 a game since 1999 .
kessler attributes the success to the professional management of the german nfl teams , at least one of which has won the championship since 1998 , and the country 's postwar affection for the united states . " germans have a willingness to accept americana , and american culture , " said kessler .
" and football is a big part of that . "
in 1999 , the league moved the london monarchs to berlin .
four years later , barcelona became the cologne centurions .
tossell attributed the closures to the lack of good stadiums and competition offered by other sports in london and barcelona . but german teams were also successful because of the way in which they reached out to different audiences .
teams like the frankfurt galaxy offer " power parties " three to four hours before each game with games and events designed to attract the entire family .
the parking lot parties spill then spill into the stadium . " what they offer appeals to different types of people , ages and everything , " said kessler . developing dirk nowitzki now the nfl europe is planning on solidifying its base here .
the league has begun cooperating with the existing german football league , which has been a starting point for young german talent .

" a big part -lrb- of our future -rrb- is getting players to a level where they can go and compete in the nfl , " said tossell .
" you only have to look at a guy like yao ming and the effect he 's had in china on the nba business .
we do n't have that yet . "

but their patience seems to be wearing thin . many owners are starting to wonder whether supporting a minor league for american football is still worthwhile .
at the annual nfl owners ' meeting in the fall of 2003 , a plan to keep the nfl europe around passed by only one vote . " they need to be successful pretty quickly , " said kessler . officials think hamburg is the final piece in the puzzle .
in concentrating the league in germany , nfl europe has more of a chance of striking national media sponsorships and television deals , said tossell .
after some success here , the league can think about making a second run at both old and new markets .
it 's something that ca n't happen soon enough , said kessler .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .
roche is an award-winning viva star .
but despite her ongoing contracts , she last week entered a strike .
she therefore pre-empted the end of her show " fast forward , " which viva plans to discontinue at the end of the year .

following viacom 's takeover of german music channel viva , viewers face more trash , comics and fee-based hotlines . rapper alvin nathaniel joiner alias xzibit and his west coast crew have a show on mtv .
okay , you say to yourself , a musician and a music television station - that makes sense .
the show , called " pimp my ride , " helps any auto mechanic 's wildest dreams come true .
it 's all about cars and fixing them up - to perfection .
xzibit takes cars fit for the junkyard and equips them alternatively with a dozen televisions , a water-pik or maybe a handful of video game panels .
but this has nothing to do with music .
it does n't matter , though .
music television as we knew it is long gone .
music -lrb- non -rrb- stop next year , things will get worse .
the us media group viacom is taking over germany 's other national music tv station , viva , and things look bleak for music video lovers in the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viva 's headquarters could soon close its doors for good .
the € 310 million -lrb- $ 410 million -rrb- deal gives viacom , which already owns mtv , a monopoly in this sector in germany .
apparently , viacom plans to seriously slim down the programming .
according to the program schedule for 2005 , music will practically be cut out of the mtv program between 1:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
instead of shows supported by editorial teams , there will be even more pre-produced english language trash formats , even more bargain cartoons and clips with fee-based hotlines .
music will be degraded to background noise .
bildunterschrift : mtv has taken the music out of music television the slogan " music nonstop , " which led mtv for years , has done its duty .
music as a cultural good and music television as its medium are apparently no longer in demand in times of daily quotas , market share and advertising sales .
after all , it 's got to be profitable .
the worst scenario now , viva 's 290 employees face a more than uncertain future .
personnel cuts and a move to berlin , where mtv germany is based , are possible options for viacom in the course of optimizing profits .
" we are hearing various reports on whether viva will go to berlin in part or completely , " reinhard boeck , press spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- government , told dw-world .
he said the nrw state secretary for media , miriam meckel , had been to the united states prior to viacom 's takeover .
" she made our interest clear to keep viva here , " said boeck .
viva itself would not confirm the rumors of mass layoffs .
official information is not expected until january or february , when viacom plans to sign a control agreement with viva .
commercially not successful " music is the core of mtv , " said catherine mühlemann .
but in her next sentence , the head of mtv germany quickly added that fashion and lifestyle products are almost just as important .
and of course , it 's about entertainment , as well .
mühlemann and the programming department find formats like reality tv show " big brother " better suited for the entertainment understanding of their target audience .
" the viacoms of this world do n't understand why you should have a cultural show or something that is seemingly commercially unsuccessful , " said charlotte roche in an interview with the newspaper frankfurter allgemeinen sonntagszeitung .
roche is an award-winning viva star .
but despite her ongoing contracts , she last week entered a strike .
she therefore pre-empted the end of her show " fast forward , " which viva plans to discontinue at the end of the year .
the music television project , which started on aug .
1 , 1981 with the legendary first mtv video of the buggles ' " video killed the radio star " should perhaps end with a single by the band the libertines : " i no longer hear the music . "
and although the song is actually about something totally different , it fits perfectly . marcus bösch -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de viacom snaps up german mtv rival viva mtv owner viacom has announced it will buy a majority stake in german rival viva media .
critics fear the buyout could crush competition in the music video market .
-lrb- june 28 , 2004 -rrb- german reality shows in need of reality check reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants .

the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions . the german commission that is responsible for files that survived the shredders of the east german secret police , or stasi , will reportedly be disbanded .
the move would correspond with the already announced change of control of the commission from the ministry of the interior to the state ministry for culture and media according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
the paper reported that it received a copy of an internal strategy paper from the culture ministry in which the duties of the federal commission , currently headed by marianne birthler , would be handed over to other institutions .
the birthler commission " will be integrated into the federal archive and the educational and research duties of the commission for stasi records will be handed over to stiftung aufarbeitung foundation and / or other institutes , " the strategy paper stated .
the dissolution of the commission in its current form would " be completed by the year 2010 . "
over 180 kilometers of files are in the stasi archive and would end up in the federal archive in koblenz .
the culture ministry would then take over the educational and research functions that birthler 's commission now oversee and then pass them on to the ministry 's own stiftung aufarbeitung foundation or other modern history research institutions according to the strategy paper .
only one of many options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss in response to the possible dissolution of the commission , weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- said to the berliner zeitung it was only one concept of many that were being discussed in the ministry regarding the future of the commission when her office assumes control of it .
her deputy responsible for the strategy paper , knut nevermann , did not confer with her about the proposed the details , such as the possible dissolution date of 2010 .
regarding the transfer from the interior to the culture ministry , birthler said she had not been informed of it before the announcement last week .
" the culture minister assured me that there will be an open discussion about the long-term perspectives of those institutions that deal with the injustices of the sed state , " birthler told the newspaper after having spoken with weiss .
the stasi commissioner also wrote a letter to the parliament , reminding the lawmakers that they must make any decisions regarding the future of the files and the commission .
the now public internal discussions have come somewhat as a surprise .
only last week weiss had said in a press release that " the original contribution of the commission , to store , administer and make accessible the files of the ministry for state security would be supported in the future .

the problem lies in the wording , which the culture minister would have pay tribute to the half million " gypsies " murdered by the nazis .

they want it made plain that their suffering was the result of the same racial hatred . but the culture minister spokesman expressed some concerns over the former president 's statement . " historians also see differences between the persecution of the jews and that of the sinti and roma , making it problematic to present them as equal , " he said . but romani rose said they council would not accept the proposed wording , which he said also proved the culture ministry 's lack of respect and ignorance about the sinti and roma holocaust victims . a survivor of the holocaust , 81-year-old reinhard florian , also said he was opposed to the word " gypsies . " " i do n't want to see this word on our monument , as soon as i hear it i think of the old times and of the ss , " he told the reuters news agency . six million jews were murdered in the holocaust , but other persecuted groups included homosexuals , conscientious objectors , communists and jehovah 's witnesses . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : celebrating europe 's maligned minority berlin mayor klaus wowereit recently opened the german capital 's first ever festival for sinti and roma culture .

but as one girl 's story shows , it does not have to be that way .
permanently excluded from two schools , olivia is now hoping to get a place at a top university .
but without the support of a leading pupil referral unit , the 17-year-old 's story could have been very different .
" i was rude and cheeky .
i did n't have any respect for teachers , " she said .
" it was verbal abuse , i bullied students and i bullied teachers .
" once a group of us were playing truant and we rang the school , making abusive calls - mine was the worst really .
" i did n't like the authority there and i tried to corrupt that authoritarian atmosphere .
" gcses , a-levels , university seemed so far away , i did n't think of the consequences - i was in with the cool crowd . "
after a year at her local grammar school in buckinghamshire and several short-term exclusions , olivia was permanently excluded .
my gcses are n't the best ever , but i hope i can show them i 've been on a steep learning curve olivia she was sent to another grammar school in the county , only to be expelled from there as well two years later .
she was sent to wycombe grange pupil referral unit -lrb- pru -rrb- , which proved the beginning of olivia 's transformation .
" it shook me up .
i was in a terrible situation , not knowing where i was going to sit my gcses . "
staff at the pru helped her work through various issues and , noting her academic ability , organised a range of lessons so she could complete her gcse exams .
now she is successfully integrated into a local sixth form and got two as and a d in her as-levels this summer .
she is currently applying to some of the uk 's leading universities , such as durham and university college london , to read english .
" my gcses are n't the best ever , but i hope i can show them i 've been on a steep learning curve since then .
" fingers crossed - i hope i can thrive in that environment . "
a ' turn-around ' olivia may not be the most typical example of a pupil permanently excluded from school - not now - but without targeted intervention from her local education authority and pru , she knows she could have been treading a very different path .
the provision for pupils like olivia in buckinghamshire is highlighted as an example of best practice by ofsted inspectors , but the watchdog remains concerned that too many vulnerable young people across england are " being lost to the system , becoming disaffected and underachieving " .
robert now has a positive outlook sixteen-year-old robert , who attends the abbey centre pru in aylesbury after being permanently excluded from his school , agrees that the special help on offer has helped him to " turn around " .
" i would have probably just been out of school and not had nothing .
i 'd have just been at home doing nothing , " he said .
now he is studying for four gcses , an ict course at the local college and a mechanics course .
he is positive about the future and looks forward to learning a trade through the modern apprenticeship system .
" they do n't look down on you like a kid here , they talk to you like you 're the same age as them . "
' yob ' image the popular image of prus might be of yobs sitting around with their feet on the desks and their hoods pulled up defensively around their faces .
it 's no good having a fire service where you call them out when the fire is blazing pru head george lloyd but the reality is often very different .
with specialist support on offer , many pupils settle down well and find they can manage their behaviour more positively than in the formal school environment .
and with local colleges and charitable groups offering a range of courses , prus are often surprisingly quiet .
" prus in buckinghamshire are not ' sin-bins ' , they are part of the behaviour support system , " said george lloyd , head of the wycombe grange pru attended by olivia .
much of the work of the prus in buckinghamshire focuses on prevention - keeping within schools children who are at risk of exclusion .
teams work closely with schools , offering part-time placements for pupils with behavioural difficulties and training teachers in behaviour management .
" our outreach work is very important , because by the time they get here it 's too late really , " says mark norwood , who works on the outreach team at the abbey centre , attended by robert .
' damaged ' as george lloyd puts it : " it 's no good having a fire service where you call them out when the fire is blazing - the best pru is an empty pru . "
removing children to a special unit also spares their classmates and he dismisses critics who say this special provision is just privileging disruptive pupils .
" how much damage is that kid doing to the other 29 kids in the class ?
there 's no point leaving them in an environment they 'll play merry hell in . "
mr lloyd stressed that many of the pupils who end up in prus are very " damaged " and need specialist help .
" if you do n't invest in them now , they will continue to drain society in a way you have n't seen yet , " he said .
" a lot of these kids ca n't help themselves - they might be involved in drugs because their parents are or involved in criminality because their parents are .
" i think it 's immoral if we let them down . "

i was in a terrible situation , not knowing where i was going to sit my gcses . "
staff at the pru helped her work through various issues and , noting her academic ability , organised a range of lessons so she could complete her gcse exams .
now she is successfully integrated into a local sixth form and got two as and a d in her as-levels this summer .
she is currently applying to some of the uk 's leading universities , such as durham and university college london , to read english .
" my gcses are n't the best ever , but i hope i can show them i 've been on a steep learning curve since then .
" fingers crossed - i hope i can thrive in that environment . "
a ' turn-around ' olivia may not be the most typical example of a pupil permanently excluded from school - not now - but without targeted intervention from her local education authority and pru , she knows she could have been treading a very different path .
the provision for pupils like olivia in buckinghamshire is highlighted as an example of best practice by ofsted inspectors , but the watchdog remains concerned that too many vulnerable young people across england are " being lost to the system , becoming disaffected and underachieving " .
robert now has a positive outlook sixteen-year-old robert , who attends the abbey centre pru in aylesbury after being permanently excluded from his school , agrees that the special help on offer has helped him to " turn around " .
" i would have probably just been out of school and not had nothing .
i 'd have just been at home doing nothing , " he said .
now he is studying for four gcses , an ict course at the local college and a mechanics course .
he is positive about the future and looks forward to learning a trade through the modern apprenticeship system .
" they do n't look down on you like a kid here , they talk to you like you 're the same age as them . "
' yob ' image the popular image of prus might be of yobs sitting around with their feet on the desks and their hoods pulled up defensively around their faces .
it 's no good having a fire service where you call them out when the fire is blazing pru head george lloyd but the reality is often very different .
with specialist support on offer , many pupils settle down well and find they can manage their behaviour more positively than in the formal school environment .
and with local colleges and charitable groups offering a range of courses , prus are often surprisingly quiet .
" prus in buckinghamshire are not ' sin-bins ' , they are part of the behaviour support system , " said george lloyd , head of the wycombe grange pru attended by olivia .
much of the work of the prus in buckinghamshire focuses on prevention - keeping within schools children who are at risk of exclusion .
teams work closely with schools , offering part-time placements for pupils with behavioural difficulties and training teachers in behaviour management .
" our outreach work is very important , because by the time they get here it 's too late really , " says mark norwood , who works on the outreach team at the abbey centre , attended by robert .
' damaged ' as george lloyd puts it : " it 's no good having a fire service where you call them out when the fire is blazing - the best pru is an empty pru . "
removing children to a special unit also spares their classmates and he dismisses critics who say this special provision is just privileging disruptive pupils .
" how much damage is that kid doing to the other 29 kids in the class ?
there 's no point leaving them in an environment they 'll play merry hell in . "
mr lloyd stressed that many of the pupils who end up in prus are very " damaged " and need specialist help .
" if you do n't invest in them now , they will continue to drain society in a way you have n't seen yet , " he said .
" a lot of these kids ca n't help themselves - they might be involved in drugs because their parents are or involved in criminality because their parents are .
" i think it 's immoral if we let them down . "

funding of more than £ 5m from ministers will be used in the purge on trouble .
local authorities have been given beefed-up powers under the scottish cabinet 's flagship blitz on anti-social behaviour .
minister for parliamentary business margaret curran said : " my message to hard-working people in glasgow and across the country is a positive one .
" anti-social behaviour is a serious problem but it need not be tolerated . "
tough steps include investigators probing reports of trouble , as part of a community relations unit contactable via a hotline . "
anti-social behaviour has for too long been a scourge which blights some of our communities " councillor jim coleman glasgow city council the service , which works with the glasgow housing association , was previously available only to council tenants .
the drive against anti-social behaviour , led by the anti-social behaviour taskforce , also includes a new mediation service .
trouble-shooters aim to settle neighbourhood clashes before they blow up .
deputy council leader jim coleman said : " anti-social behaviour has for too long been a scourge which blights some of our communities .
" we are confident that the introduction of these new services and the strategic approach developed with our partners will offer some respite to those affected by this kind of abuse .
" we want to prevent problems from escalating through mediation and other preventative measures . "
he added : " however , persistent and significant anti-social behaviour must not be tolerated and we will work with our partners to address that . "
the new measures follow the decision in september to put more than 40 community patrol officers on the streets of glasgow .
the " eyes and ears " of the community have already reported 1,500 problems ranging from gangs and graffiti to fly tipping and faulty street lighting .

the ballymena-born actor said that the theatre on ridgeway street was in a " very dilapidated condition " .
lyric chairman david johnston has said that rebuilding the theatre , at a cost of £ 8m is the only answer .
mr neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of " healthy , wealthy irish americans " in one room and ask them to help with fundraising .
belisha beacon the oscar-nominated actor , whose films include schindler 's list , michael collins and star wars : the phantom menace , said : " the lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of northern ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart .
" it gave me a start professionally .
mary o 'malley , the founder of the theatre , gave me my future .
" in those days , in the mid-70s , when i was there , we were doing a play every four weeks .
" belfast was not a pretty town to be living in .
" there was serious trouble , as you know , but this theatre was like a belisha beacon of light and hope six nights a week , doing everything from shakespeare to yeats to o 'casey with a group of actors and actresses that affected me very deeply and still do . "
the lyric began 50 years ago but the doors opened at its present site on the stranmillis embankment overlooking the river lagan in 1968 .
what an orator .
he was from that old school of bible-thumping righteousness .
but it was so dramatic .
i found him very powerful .
liam neeson on ian paisley as well as liam neeson , it also launched the careers of adrian dunbar and stephen rea and playwrights such as martin lynch and gary mitchell .
speaking to bbc northern ireland before the event at new york 's soho house , mr neeson said that his spirit belonged to the glens of antrim .
and he said that there was one figure from his childhood that he would love to portray on the big screen - ian paisley .
he said that the dup leader and preacher was a " very dynamic , extraordinary figure " .
neeson used to listen to his sermons on a friday night in ballymena .
he said : " what an orator .
he was from that old school of bible-thumping righteousness .

lord winston says the group 's " shocking mismanagement " of recent issues had led him to speak out .
the authority has been at the centre of a number of recent public rows such as sex selection and creating babies whose tissue matches a sick sibling .
but the hfea defended its role as a regulatory body .
abolish or replace the authority licenses fertility clinics and regulates embryo research .
but critics say times have changed since the body was formed in 1991 as technology has advanced . "
having a regulator has given the public confidence in the infertility sector and the system of regulation " suzi leather , hfea lord winston called for it to be abolished or replaced with a more flexible body .
in an interview for bbc radio 4 's today programme , lord winston also called for the law governing assisted reproduction to be re-written .
he said : " it is very strange that one form of treatment - ivf - is singled out for regulation .
and not even the whole of infertility treatment is covered . "
and he said there was no proof that the existence of the hfea allayed public concerns over the development and practise of pioneering fertility techniques .
lord winston said that he would like to see a more efficient body in the hfea 's place .
" something a great deal less bureaucratic , which does n't inhibit research , which has a better consultation process with the public and which has a much more adequate inspection process . "
he added : " it is time for parliament to revise what 's happening . "
lord winston said the proposed human tissue authority could take on the work of the hfea .
dame mary warnock , who chaired the inquiry which led to the 1990 human fertility and embryology act , said the hfea should continue to regulate clinics ' work , but should no longer be responsible for ethical decisions .
" i 'm not sure the same body is really right for carrying out both of those things . "
' therapeutic cloning ' but suzi leather , chairman of the hfea , defended its work and said the authority still had an important role to play .

" and having a regulator has given the public confidence in the infertility sector and the system of regulation . "
ms leather said it accepted parliament did need to examine infertility issues again , because the act on which the hfea 's work is based was 14 years old .
" science has moved on very fast and some of the treatments were not envisaged when parliament last looked at this . "
professor peter braude , chairman of the royal college of obstetrician and gynaecologists scientific advisory committee and a former member of the hfea backed the authority 's work .
" there is going to be change .
the hfea itself has called for change . "
he added : " i have utmost respect for lord winston , but i think some of his remarks are out of order .
i do n't think it helps public confidence . "
the commons science and technology select committee is currently looking at issues relating to reproductive technology , including how the area should be regulated .
designer babies in august , the authority granted permission for experts at newcastle university to carry out ' therapeutic cloning ' of human embryos for the first time .
researchers will use the technique as part of research to try to find new treatment for diabetes , parkinson 's and alzheimer 's disease .
last month , a legal challenge was launched in the high court by peng voong , of the lawyers ' christian fellowship , backed by the pro-life alliance , against the decision .
in july , the authority had relaxed rules on the creation of so-called designer babies to help sick siblings .

ulfa is one of the most powerful groups in the region and has been fighting indian security forces for more than two decades .
the group has recently indicated that it is willing to begin negotiations as long as they were unconditional .
correspondents say that ulfa would like the question of assamese sovereignty to be included in the agenda , which is something that is unacceptable to delhi .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- japan extends its military reach bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 10 december 2004 , 07:36 gmt japan extends its military reach by sarah buckley bbc news japan 's decision to extend its troops ' mandate in iraq will mean they stay in the country for at least another year .
but the move , seen as part of prime minister junichiro koizumi 's efforts to reshape japan 's foreign policy , could have consequences for many years to come .
the decision is controversial because most of the japanese people want the troops , who are only a humanitarian force , to leave .
they are worried that worsening security makes it more likely that the contingent will be pulled into conflict - risking not only lives , but the country 's jealously guarded pacifist constitution .
but likewise the government , and some elements of the public , recognise that japan needs to continue to commit troops for the sake of its us-japan alliance , which affords the country protection against the threat of neighbour north korea .
the decision to send troops to iraq has always divided the nation .
but while opinion polls have suggested the public has been roughly split over the issue in the last few months , more recent polls say about 60 % of people were against the troops staying on for longer .
a japanese government official said the public 's perceptions were influenced by the recent insurgency in falluja , even though security in samawa in the south , where the japanese troops are stationed , is much better , and they have suffered no casualties so far .
protection quandary dutch troops also stationed in the town are due to leave in march , however , and the worry is the japanese troops face a greater threat without them .
their rules of engagement are very restricted - they can only fire in self-defence , and , if possible , they should wait for their commander 's instruction first . "
the thinking is ' hold our nose , look the other way , and support -lrb- the us -rrb- in a very nominal way " jeff kingston , temple university neither do they go on patrols , and therefore could be surprised by an attack .
" japanese troops are not well prepared to actively defend themselves .
their mission is not to maintain security , " the official said .
the japanese government is currently in discussions with the uk about the british taking over the dutch role .
but security issues are not the only worry for the japanese public .
many are concerned that the iraq mission could spell the end for the pacifist article of the country 's constitution .
this forever renounces war , and strictly speaking , forbids japan from even keeping a military force .
it has already been re-interpreted to allow for a self-defence force which has been deployed in peacekeeping and nation rebuilding exercises around the world .
the real issue is that the troops are nevertheless forbidden from serving in combat zones , and many people argue that iraq - although technically no longer at war - is exactly that .
pacifism under threat ?
japan 's constitution renounces the use of force this has been stretched to allow self-defence troops 1992 law allowed troops to join un and relief work overseas 2003 law said troops could go to non-combat zones in iraq pm koizumi wants to give japan even greater powers " it is the first time that the sdf forces have been sent to a country still in conflict , " said jeff kingston , director of asian studies at temple university , japan .
but the japanese government 's aspirations for its military may not end there .
a draft proposal by the country 's ruling liberal democratic party , seen by the country 's media last month , made a number of proposals , including suggesting they engage in collective self-defence - shooting to protect their allies as well as themselves .
a final draft is expected in november 2005 .
the japanese government also announced , on friday , its plans for defence spending over the next five years .
the national defence programme outline calls , among other things , for a relaxation to japan 's arms ban , and for more flexible military capabilities and an active engagement in peace-keeping , suggesting that in future japanese forces will be deployed overseas more frequently .
while changes to the military are technically in contravention of article 9 - which forbids japan from maintaining any armed forces at all - a japanese government official said this would not mean that the article needed to be rewritten .
it is all a question of interpretation .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi does want to recommend changes to the constitution ultimately - and put them to a public referendum - but the official said this would not happen for several years .
the most high-profile sign of this change is the sdf 's presence in iraq .
yoshioka tatsuya , director of the japanese ngo peace boat , said the troops ' role was exactly that - symbolic , not substantive .
" we do n't know the exact reason why we need to send troops to iraq .
they are just like a far east poodle of mr bush , " he said .
" we are really very angry . "
strategic thinking mr kingston agreed that the troops were playing a minimal role and their real purpose was to demonstrate japan 's commitment to the us .
he said there were two main reasons for this : as a kind of " painful insurance policy " taken out to win us protection against north korea , and to bolster japan 's campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council .
" the thinking is ' hold our nose , look the other way , and support them in a very nominal way , " ' he said .
however nominal their role may be , it carries high political stakes .
" if a bunch of japanese troops start dying , i think you 'll have an evaporation of support for this , " said mr kingston .

but the move , seen as part of prime minister junichiro koizumi 's efforts to reshape japan 's foreign policy , could have consequences for many years to come .
the decision is controversial because most of the japanese people want the troops , who are only a humanitarian force , to leave .
japanese troops are helping to rebuild infrastructure they are worried that worsening security makes it more likely that the contingent will be pulled into conflict - risking not only lives , but the country 's jealously guarded pacifist constitution .
but likewise the government , and some elements of the public , recognise that japan needs to continue to commit troops for the sake of its us-japan alliance , which affords the country protection against the threat of neighbour north korea .
the decision to send troops to iraq has always divided the nation .
but while opinion polls have suggested the public has been roughly split over the issue in the last few months , more recent polls say about 60 % of people were against the troops staying on for longer .
a japanese government official said the public 's perceptions were influenced by the recent insurgency in falluja , even though security in samawa in the south , where the japanese troops are stationed , is much better , and they have suffered no casualties so far .
protection quandary dutch troops also stationed in the town are due to leave in march , however , and the worry is the japanese troops face a greater threat without them .
their rules of engagement are very restricted - they can only fire in self-defence , and , if possible , they should wait for their commander 's instruction first .
the thinking is ' hold our nose , look the other way , and support -lrb- the us -rrb- in a very nominal way jeff kingston , temple university neither do they go on patrols , and therefore could be surprised by an attack .
" japanese troops are not well prepared to actively defend themselves .
their mission is not to maintain security , " the official said .
the japanese government is currently in discussions with the uk about the british taking over the dutch role .
but security issues are not the only worry for the japanese public .
many are concerned that the iraq mission could spell the end for the pacifist article of the country 's constitution .
this forever renounces war , and strictly speaking , forbids japan from even keeping a military force .
it has already been re-interpreted to allow for a self-defence force which has been deployed in peacekeeping and nation rebuilding exercises around the world .
the real issue is that the troops are nevertheless forbidden from serving in combat zones , and many people argue that iraq - although technically no longer at war - is exactly that .
pacifism under threat ?
japan 's constitution renounces the use of force this has been stretched to allow self-defence troops 1992 law allowed troops to join un and relief work overseas 2003 law said troops could go to non-combat zones in iraq pm koizumi wants to give japan even greater powers " it is the first time that the sdf forces have been sent to a country still in conflict , " said jeff kingston , director of asian studies at temple university , japan .
but the japanese government 's aspirations for its military may not end there .
a draft proposal by the country 's ruling liberal democratic party , seen by the country 's media last month , made a number of proposals , including suggesting they engage in collective self-defence - shooting to protect their allies as well as themselves .
a final draft is expected in november 2005 .
the japanese government also announced , on friday , its plans for defence spending over the next five years .
defence chief yoshinori ono spent six hours in iraq to show it was safe the national defence programme outline calls , among other things , for a relaxation to japan 's arms ban , and for more flexible military capabilities and an active engagement in peace-keeping , suggesting that in future japanese forces will be deployed overseas more frequently .
while changes to the military are technically in contravention of article 9 - which forbids japan from maintaining any armed forces at all - a japanese government official said this would not mean that the article needed to be rewritten .
it is all a question of interpretation .
japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi does want to recommend changes to the constitution ultimately - and put them to a public referendum - but the official said this would not happen for several years .
the most high-profile sign of this change is the sdf 's presence in iraq .
yoshioka tatsuya , director of the japanese ngo peace boat , said the troops ' role was exactly that - symbolic , not substantive .
" we do n't know the exact reason why we need to send troops to iraq .
they are just like a far east poodle of mr bush , " he said .
" we are really very angry . "
strategic thinking mr kingston agreed that the troops were playing a minimal role and their real purpose was to demonstrate japan 's commitment to the us .
he said there were two main reasons for this : as a kind of " painful insurance policy " taken out to win us protection against north korea , and to bolster japan 's campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council .
" the thinking is ' hold our nose , look the other way , and support them in a very nominal way , " ' he said .
however nominal their role may be , it carries high political stakes .
" if a bunch of japanese troops start dying , i think you 'll have an evaporation of support for this , " said mr kingston .

the general medical council should do more to protect patients , according to a fifth inquiry into the serial killer gp harold shipman .
the inquiry has proposed changes to the system including how gps are monitored and disciplined , ensuring a doctor 's past history is disclosed to a potential employer and a better complaints system .
the gmc says it has improved practices in the five years since the conviction and is confident that " another shipman " could not happen .
do you have confidence in your gp ?
are gps properly vetted and managed by the gmc ?
will patient care be under threat if gps spend more time on form filling ?
send us your views using the form .
this debate has now been closed .
thanks for your comments . "
any group of people that hold the power of life and death needs to be regulated tightly " rob , london , uk any group of people that hold the power of life and death needs to be regulated tightly .
the argument that only doctors have the knowledge to judge other doctors actions just does n't wash : we put lay people with no legal knowledge on juries , do n't we ?
rob , london , uk so , a lot of people here regard us doctors as self-serving and only interested in our own ends , rather maligning our integrity .
so how would they grade the average doctors integrity and self-sacrifice in the interests of their fellow men in comparison to , say , politicians , journalists , or , dare i ask , lawyers or health service managers ?
jg , huddersfield uk the gmc would be more effective if it introduced a proper system of clinical appraisal for doctors rather than the current one which allows doctors to fail to disclose anything which might put them in a negative light .
the appraisal system lacks teeth .
anon , brighton it is no wonder most of the best quality professionals in health care , teaching , it etc are going abroad .
we will end up with semi professionals in major areas of society .
t newman , bournemouth uk they may be confident that " another shipman could not happen " , but do they trust their own mothers to anyone they do n't already know ?
gerry noble , salisbury , uk " the gmc has already carried out the most wide ranging reform of any of the regulatory bodies " paul thorpe , taunton uk this is yesterday 's news .
the gmc has already carried out the most wide ranging reform of any of the regulatory bodies .
i would love to see the regulatory bodies governing lawyers and mps given over to a majority of the public .
dame janet smith should put her own profession 's house in order before having the gall to criticise others .
paul thorpe , taunton uk why ca n't everyone stop whining about the nhs in general and shipman in particular .
we have one of the best health schemes in the world , yet all we do is moan .
sure , it 's not perfect ... but what other country can boast a ' perfect ' system ?
carl , john o 'groats in teaching , manufacturing , transport or just about any occupation you can think of , experience tells us that it is impossible to regulate to the point of infallibility .
the more regulation we add , the more time it consumes , the less attractive the job becomes , and the less proper work gets done .
leave people to get on with their jobs !

the general medical council should do more to protect patients , according to a fifth inquiry into the serial killer gp harold shipman .
the inquiry has proposed changes to the system including how gps are monitored and disciplined , ensuring a doctor 's past history is disclosed to a potential employer and a better complaints system .
the gmc says it has improved practices in the five years since the conviction and is confident that " another shipman " could not happen .
do you have confidence in your gp ?
are gps properly vetted and managed by the gmc ?
will patient care be under threat if gps spend more time on form filling ?

this debate has now been closed .
thanks for your comments .
any group of people that hold the power of life and death needs to be regulated tightly rob , london , uk any group of people that hold the power of life and death needs to be regulated tightly .
the argument that only doctors have the knowledge to judge other doctors actions just does n't wash : we put lay people with no legal knowledge on juries , do n't we ?
rob , london , uk so , a lot of people here regard us doctors as self-serving and only interested in our own ends , rather maligning our integrity .
so how would they grade the average doctors integrity and self-sacrifice in the interests of their fellow men in comparison to , say , politicians , journalists , or , dare i ask , lawyers or health service managers ?
jg , huddersfield uk the gmc would be more effective if it introduced a proper system of clinical appraisal for doctors rather than the current one which allows doctors to fail to disclose anything which might put them in a negative light .
the appraisal system lacks teeth .

the gmc has already carried out the most wide ranging reform of any of the regulatory bodies .

carl , john o 'groats in teaching , manufacturing , transport or just about any occupation you can think of , experience tells us that it is impossible to regulate to the point of infallibility .
