the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight .

" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

the ruling conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the ban , which has already been introduced in four of germany 's 16 federal states , was designed to protect pupils from the influence of islamic fundamentalism .
" the veil is widely abused by islamic fundamentalist groups as a political symbol , " said bavaria 's culture minister , monika hohlmeier .
the social democratic party and greens , who rule in a coalition on a national level , voted against the ban in the regional parliament and said it was questionable from a legal point of view .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.11.2004 a test of faith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men engaged in a dark test of will and of faith a priest is granted a nine-day furlough from the nazi camp dachau , but is forced to make a terrible choice .
the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .

the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .

from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .

doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .

and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .

cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .

parliamentary speaker rawhi fattuh , a 55-year-old married man with three children , who was sworn in as acting head of the palestinian authority in the hours following the official announcement of yasser arafat 's death , is a minor politician seen as too marginal to stamp his mark on a turbulent post-arafat era .
for a man who spent 30 years in exile with the leader , returning with him in triumph to gaza in 1994 , and a loyal lieutenant in the mainstream fatah party , fattuh has never emerged from the shadows as a key player in his own right .
" i swear to almighty god that i will be committed to the homeland and its sacred places and to respect the law and constitution , " he said during thursday 's swearing-in ceremony in parliament just hours after arafat died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat observers say there is a consensus that fattuh is far too marginal , lacking a real power base to be practical or successful .
pledging that elections would be held within a set two-month timeframe , he hailed arafat as the " father of palestinian nationalism - the first fighter and a great martyr . "
fattuh was born in 1949 in the depressed southern gaza strip town of rafah , which straddles the egyptian border .
he was elected mp to the palestinian legislative council in 1996 , serving as deputy speaker until 2004 .
faithful follower of arafat his one and only stab at a cabinet job came in the government of prime minister ahmed qureia , who has struggled to impose his authority over the past year .
he served briefly as agriculture minister in early 2004 .
but in march 2004 , he resigned to campaign as parliamentary speaker .
as a faithful arafat lieutenant in a house dominated by fatah , he easily won the election by a vote of 51-15 .
five mps spoiled their ballots .
at the time , palestinian officials said he was chosen as fatah 's man for the job because of his gaza birth , in a bid to ratchet up unity between the divided palestinian territories ahead of israel 's plan to evacuate the gaza strip next year .
according to the basic law , fattuh will serve as interim pa president only until elections are held within 60 days after the president 's death or incapacitation .
even so , his position will only be honorary .
arafat 's far more powerful number two in the palestine liberation organization , mahmud abbas , is already effectively in charge of the plo .
qureia is likely to stay on as premier until elections .
experts fear in-fighting but israel 's continued incursions and closures in the palestinian territories are likely to stall polls , analysts have predicted , meaning that a weak front man could only exacerbate the domestic infighting expected after arafat 's end .

for a man who spent 30 years in exile with the leader , returning with him in triumph to gaza in 1994 , and a loyal lieutenant in the mainstream fatah party , fattuh has never emerged from the shadows as a key player in his own right .
" i swear to almighty god that i will be committed to the homeland and its sacred places and to respect the law and constitution , " he said during thursday 's swearing-in ceremony in parliament just hours after arafat died .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat observers say there is a consensus that fattuh is far too marginal , lacking a real power base to be practical or successful .
pledging that elections would be held within a set two-month timeframe , he hailed arafat as the " father of palestinian nationalism - the first fighter and a great martyr . "
fattuh was born in 1949 in the depressed southern gaza strip town of rafah , which straddles the egyptian border .
he was elected mp to the palestinian legislative council in 1996 , serving as deputy speaker until 2004 .
faithful follower of arafat his one and only stab at a cabinet job came in the government of prime minister ahmed qureia , who has struggled to impose his authority over the past year .
he served briefly as agriculture minister in early 2004 .
but in march 2004 , he resigned to campaign as parliamentary speaker .
as a faithful arafat lieutenant in a house dominated by fatah , he easily won the election by a vote of 51-15 .
five mps spoiled their ballots .
at the time , palestinian officials said he was chosen as fatah 's man for the job because of his gaza birth , in a bid to ratchet up unity between the divided palestinian territories ahead of israel 's plan to evacuate the gaza strip next year .
according to the basic law , fattuh will serve as interim pa president only until elections are held within 60 days after the president 's death or incapacitation .
even so , his position will only be honorary .
arafat 's far more powerful number two in the palestine liberation organization , mahmud abbas , is already effectively in charge of the plo .
qureia is likely to stay on as premier until elections .
experts fear in-fighting but israel 's continued incursions and closures in the palestinian territories are likely to stall polls , analysts have predicted , meaning that a weak front man could only exacerbate the domestic infighting expected after arafat 's end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marwan barghouti , head of the palestinian fatah tanzim and al-aksa martyrs brigades , gestures as israeli police bring him into the district court , thursday 20 may 2004 in tel aviv for his judgement hearing .
the court convicted prominent palestinian uprising leader marwan barghouti of overseeing militant attacks that killed five people.he was also found guilty of attempted murder for his role in an attempted car bombing at a jerusalem mall and convicted of a terror organization .
another name in the frame is jailed west bank fatah leader marwan barghouti .
however , israeli foreign minister silvan shalom categorically ruled out any role for barghuti in the palestinian leadership following the death of arafat .
" barghouti was convicted to life in prison and he will stay in prison until the end of his days , given that he was implicated in numerous terrorist attacks that caused the deaths of numerous innocent israelis , " shalom told reporters .
barghouti - who was often tipped as a possible successor to arafat due to his enormous popularity - was handed five life prison terms for murder by an israeli court on june 6 . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palestinian leader yasser arafat dies aged 75 yassir arafat , the 75-year-old palestinian leader , was determined to be clinically dead in a french military hospital in the early hours of thursday morning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 a passion for prescriptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the common cold is an ailment germans give serious attention to as the last autumn leaves flutter to the ground dragging germany headlong into winter , patients across the country are preparing for their annual love affair with the doctors ' waiting room . call it a passion , an obsession or merely a healthy interest , there is no getting away from the fact that germans nurture a very loving relationship with their physical wellbeing .
and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .
" it is legitimate to go to the doctor , people would rather go there than to a psychologist or a priest , " dr. effertz said .
cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .
" there is now an obvious hurdle for people to go to the doctor , they observe their symptoms more closely and wait to see if they go away before seeking medical help , " dr. linnig told dw-world . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .
the only problem is the population 's unwillingness to take them .

but those who do so are taking on the risk of going bankrupt paying for medical treatment .

german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shuddered to a near-halt in the period from july to september , growing by a meager 0.1 percent , the federal statistics office destatis calculated .
growth was therefore not only much slower than 0.4 percent recorded in both of the preceding two quarters , but it was the slowest rate of growth of the german economy since the second quarter of 2003 , the final quarter of the last recession .
destatis attributed the sharp slowdown to falling exports .
domestic demand , previously seen as the achilles ' heel of the german economy , picked up strongly in the third quarter , destatis noted .
nevertheless , household spending , a key component of recovery , remained depressed .
for the whole of 2004 , the german government is currently forecasting full-year gdp growth of around 1.8 percent . more briefs 11.11.2004 -pipe- lufthansa , allianz , apax to float service stations 10.11.2004 -pipe- 760,000 german industrial jobs at risk 10.11.2004 -pipe- report : deutsche telekom to sell stake in russia 's mts 10.11.2004 -pipe- german exports booming 09.11.2004 -pipe- dhl to open european hub in leipzig 09.11.2004 -pipe- infineon post profit but lowers outlook 09.11.2004 -pipe- bertelsmann q3 profit surges 08.11.2004 -pipe- germans concerned about rising euro radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .

the european parliament meanwhile has launched its own anti-racism group . high on the conference 's agenda is the exchange of " best practices " with regard to the integration of ethnic minorities .
delegates of the two-day meeting , which ends thursday , are trying to come up with ways to make immigrants feel more welcome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita verdonk " we do not want to simply focus on a theoretical framework , but find an approach that really works , " rita verdonk -lrb- photo -rrb- , dutch integration minister , said at the opening .
" how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ? " parliamentary group meanwhile , the european parliament ’ s anti-racism and diversity intergroup has been set up to ensure a parliamentary voice for millions of ethnic minority eu citizens .
its president , a uk mep of asian background , claude moraes , said there was an urgent need for such a group . " within the european parliament as with most national parliaments , there are very , very few ethnic minority meps , " he said , adding that only about a dozen out of more than 700 parliamentarians belonged to ethnic minorities .
" that means that we need to get together along with likeminded meps , who believe that anti-racism , issues of integration , issues around islamophobia , anti-semitism , the plight of the roma , all of these issues require an all-party , multi-party voice . " bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament the group has the backing of over 120 meps and key ethnic minority meps are vice-presidents of the group , including the german meps , cem özdemir and feleknas uca .
claude moraes said they will be able to highlight issues that aren ’ t currently receiving a lot of attention . germany , greece slow to change " most european union countries , including germany , have had difficulty in implementing anti-discrimination legislation , " he said .
" germany and greece for example have yet to implement the race equality directive , which bars discrimination on racial grounds , against european citizens .
we will be very bold in our group in identifying those countries which have yet to live up to those standards . " the group says it will provide a robust ethnic minority voice in europe at a critical and sensitive time on issues of integration , multiculturalism and the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration populist parties across the eu .
claude moraes believes a fear of tackling racism needs to be overcome . " people feel very afraid of these issues , they are very sensitive issues in germany and elsewhere and because of this , it 's very difficult sometimes for politicians to get together to ensure that we have a proper take on these issues , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

" our president , our leader , the holder of the flag to the new future , brother yasser arafat , passed away at 4:30 this morning -lrb- 3:30 cet -rrb- , " tayeb abdelrahim , the head of the palestinian authority leader 's office , told reporters outside arafat 's muqataa headquarters .
" the palestinian leadership mourns with our people , with the arab nation , with the whole of humanity , -lrb- the loss of -rrb- the tutor , the leader , the son of palestine , its symbol , the builder of its modern nationalism and the hero of its battle for freedom and independence , " he said .
arafat had been critically ill in the percy military hospital outside paris since being airlifted to france on oct .
29 from the west bank headquarters where he had been kept under virtual house arrest by israel for almost three years .
he had been in a coma since the middle of last week and had been placed on a life support machine .
arafat , who was born in 1929 , was probably the world 's best known guerrilla leader who later won the nobel peace prize , but in the last years of his life he was dismissed as a " terrorist " by israel .
israel heralds death as " good news " israel described his death as good news for the middle east while us president george w. bush , who had boycotted arafat for the last four years , said his passing was " a significant moment in palestinian history . "
palestinian officials said arafat 's death would be marked by an unprecedented 40-day official mourning period .
a funeral will be held in cairo on friday before his body is flown back and buried in the muqata .
the palestinian flag was flying at half-mast at the muqata and local television broadcast verses from the koran , the muslim tradition on the death of leading figures .
parliament speaker rawhi fattuh is to serve as caretaker leader of the palestinian authority for 60 days , after which new elections must be held .
former prime minister mahmud abbas will automatically take over as permanent head of both arafat 's dominant fatah faction and the palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- upon arafat 's death , while current premier , ahmed qureia , will head up the national security council .
amid fears that arafat 's death could trigger an outbreak of unrest , the israeli army imposed a total security clampdown on the west bank .
thousands of people took to the streets of gaza city after the announcement of his death , unleashing volleys of gunfire into the air and setting fire to tyres , turning the air pitch black .
ramallah grieving deeply in ramallah , a growing crowd of mainly youths gathered outside the gates of arafat 's headquarters , which overnight had been plastered with posters of the only leader palestinians had ever known .
french president jacques chirac led the tributes to arafat , announcing he would go to the percy military hospital to " pay a final homage to president arafat . "
" i have learned with emotion of the death of president yassir arafat , first president of the palestinian authority , " chirac said in a statement .
" with him disappears a man of courage and conviction who for 40 years incarnated the palestinians ' fight for recognition of their national rights . "
among the first governments to pay tribute was indonesia , home to the world 's largest muslim population .
" it is with great sorrow and profound sadness that we learned of the demise of president yasser arafat , the leader of palestine and a hero to us all , " said foreign ministry spokesman marty natalegawa .
however israel , which has long accused arafat of being the main obstacle to peace in the middle east , did not try to mask its delight at his death .
death of ' terror ' leader welcomed " the sun is shining in the middle east and around the world , as arafat was not only the leader of terrorism against israel , but also the founding father of the terrorism that is running rampant around the world right now , including that of al-qaeda , " justice minister tommy lapid said .
" all this terrorism is the fruit of arafat 's work , and it 's good that the world is rid of him . "
israeli president moshe katsav struck a more diplomatic line , expressing hope that a post-arafat " palestinian leadership will take a new path with a view to putting an end to terrorism and violence , which would allow a resumption of negotiations . "
bush , who has previously dismissed arafat as a failure , said he hoped his death would lead to an upturn in palestinian fortunes .
" for the palestinian people , we hope that the future will bring peace and the fulfillment of their aspirations for an independent , democratic palestine that is at peace with its neighbors , " bush said in a statement .
" during the period of transition that is ahead , we urge all in the region and throughout the world to join in helping make progress toward these goals and toward the ultimate goal of peace . "
martyrs to avenge " assassination " al-aqsa martyrs brigades , an armed offshoot of arafat 's fatah movement , urged its fighters to attack israel to avenge the " zionist assassination " .
" zionist israel and the government of -lrb- israeli prime minister ariel -rrb- sharon are responsible for the assassination of our leader by putting him under siege , " it said in a statement .
leaders react to arafat 's death world leaders and figures were quick to offer their views on the death of arafat .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said , " an era has ended ...
everything must be done now to achieve an orderly transfer of power .
of utmost importance is a leadership , made legitimate through early elections , which remains committed to a fair peace settlement . "
britain 's prime minister tony blair urged the palestinains and israelis to work towards peace after the loss of arafat .
" president arafat came to symbolise the palestinian national movement .
he led his people to an historic acceptance of the need for a two-state solution .
that goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . "
a spokesperson for kofi annan , the un secretary general , said he offered his condolences and added : " the secretary general was deeply moved to learn of the death of president yasser arafat .
president arafat was one of those few leaders who could be instantly recognised by people in any walk of life all around the world .
for nearly four decades , he expressed and symbolized in his person the national aspirations of the palestinian people . "
the statement from the un continued : " president arafat will always be remembered for having , in 1988 , led the palestinians to accept the principle of peaceful coexistence between israel and a future palestinian state .
by signing the oslo accords in 1993 he took a giant step towards the realisation of this vision .
it is tragic that he did not live to see it fulfilled .
now that he has gone , both israelis and palestinians , and the friends of both peoples throughout the world , must make even greater efforts to bring about the peaceful realisation of the palestinian right of self-determination .

israel heralds death as " good news " israel described his death as good news for the middle east while us president george w. bush , who had boycotted arafat for the last four years , said his passing was " a significant moment in palestinian history . "

amid fears that arafat 's death could trigger an outbreak of unrest , the israeli army imposed a total security clampdown on the west bank .
thousands of people took to the streets of gaza city after the announcement of his death , unleashing volleys of gunfire into the air and setting fire to tyres , turning the air pitch black .

however israel , which has long accused arafat of being the main obstacle to peace in the middle east , did not try to mask its delight at his death .
death of ' terror ' leader welcomed " the sun is shining in the middle east and around the world , as arafat was not only the leader of terrorism against israel , but also the founding father of the terrorism that is running rampant around the world right now , including that of al-qaeda , " justice minister tommy lapid said .
" all this terrorism is the fruit of arafat 's work , and it 's good that the world is rid of him . "
israeli president moshe katsav struck a more diplomatic line , expressing hope that a post-arafat " palestinian leadership will take a new path with a view to putting an end to terrorism and violence , which would allow a resumption of negotiations . "
bush , who has previously dismissed arafat as a failure , said he hoped his death would lead to an upturn in palestinian fortunes .
" for the palestinian people , we hope that the future will bring peace and the fulfillment of their aspirations for an independent , democratic palestine that is at peace with its neighbors , " bush said in a statement .
" during the period of transition that is ahead , we urge all in the region and throughout the world to join in helping make progress toward these goals and toward the ultimate goal of peace . "

" our president , our leader , the holder of the flag to the new future , brother yasser arafat , passed away at 4:30 this morning -lrb- 3:30 cet -rrb- , " tayeb abdelrahim , the head of the palestinian authority leader 's office , told reporters outside arafat 's muqataa headquarters .
" the palestinian leadership mourns with our people , with the arab nation , with the whole of humanity , -lrb- the loss of -rrb- the tutor , the leader , the son of palestine , its symbol , the builder of its modern nationalism and the hero of its battle for freedom and independence , " he said .
arafat had been critically ill in the percy military hospital outside paris since being airlifted to france on oct .
29 from the west bank headquarters where he had been kept under virtual house arrest by israel for almost three years .
he had been in a coma since the middle of last week and had been placed on a life support machine .
arafat , who was born in 1929 , was probably the world 's best known guerrilla leader who later won the nobel peace prize , but in the last years of his life he was dismissed as a " terrorist " by israel .
israel heralds death as " good news " israel described his death as good news for the middle east while us president george w. bush , who had boycotted arafat for the last four years , said his passing was " a significant moment in palestinian history . "
palestinian officials said arafat 's death would be marked by an unprecedented 40-day official mourning period .
a funeral will be held in cairo on friday before his body is flown back and buried in the muqata .
the palestinian flag was flying at half-mast at the muqata and local television broadcast verses from the koran , the muslim tradition on the death of leading figures .
parliament speaker rawhi fattuh is to serve as caretaker leader of the palestinian authority for 60 days , after which new elections must be held .
former prime minister mahmud abbas will automatically take over as permanent head of both arafat 's dominant fatah faction and the palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- upon arafat 's death , while current premier , ahmed qureia , will head up the national security council .
amid fears that arafat 's death could trigger an outbreak of unrest , the israeli army imposed a total security clampdown on the west bank .
thousands of people took to the streets of gaza city after the announcement of his death , unleashing volleys of gunfire into the air and setting fire to tyres , turning the air pitch black .
ramallah grieving deeply in ramallah , a growing crowd of mainly youths gathered outside the gates of arafat 's headquarters , which overnight had been plastered with posters of the only leader palestinians had ever known .
french president jacques chirac led the tributes to arafat , announcing he would go to the percy military hospital to " pay a final homage to president arafat . "
" i have learned with emotion of the death of president yassir arafat , first president of the palestinian authority , " chirac said in a statement .
" with him disappears a man of courage and conviction who for 40 years incarnated the palestinians ' fight for recognition of their national rights . "
among the first governments to pay tribute was indonesia , home to the world 's largest muslim population .
" it is with great sorrow and profound sadness that we learned of the demise of president yasser arafat , the leader of palestine and a hero to us all , " said foreign ministry spokesman marty natalegawa .
however israel , which has long accused arafat of being the main obstacle to peace in the middle east , did not try to mask its delight at his death .
death of ' terror ' leader welcomed " the sun is shining in the middle east and around the world , as arafat was not only the leader of terrorism against israel , but also the founding father of the terrorism that is running rampant around the world right now , including that of al-qaeda , " justice minister tommy lapid said .
" all this terrorism is the fruit of arafat 's work , and it 's good that the world is rid of him . "
israeli president moshe katsav struck a more diplomatic line , expressing hope that a post-arafat " palestinian leadership will take a new path with a view to putting an end to terrorism and violence , which would allow a resumption of negotiations . "
bush , who has previously dismissed arafat as a failure , said he hoped his death would lead to an upturn in palestinian fortunes .
" for the palestinian people , we hope that the future will bring peace and the fulfillment of their aspirations for an independent , democratic palestine that is at peace with its neighbors , " bush said in a statement .
" during the period of transition that is ahead , we urge all in the region and throughout the world to join in helping make progress toward these goals and toward the ultimate goal of peace . "
martyrs to avenge " assassination " al-aqsa martyrs brigades , an armed offshoot of arafat 's fatah movement , urged its fighters to attack israel to avenge the " zionist assassination " .
" zionist israel and the government of -lrb- israeli prime minister ariel -rrb- sharon are responsible for the assassination of our leader by putting him under siege , " it said in a statement .
leaders react to arafat 's death world leaders and figures were quick to offer their views on the death of arafat .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said , " an era has ended ...
everything must be done now to achieve an orderly transfer of power .
of utmost importance is a leadership , made legitimate through early elections , which remains committed to a fair peace settlement . "
britain 's prime minister tony blair urged the palestinains and israelis to work towards peace after the loss of arafat .

" the palestinian leadership mourns with our people , with the arab nation , with the whole of humanity , -lrb- the loss of -rrb- the tutor , the leader , the son of palestine , its symbol , the builder of its modern nationalism and the hero of its battle for freedom and independence , " he said .
arafat had been critically ill in the percy military hospital outside paris since being airlifted to france on oct .
29 from the west bank headquarters where he had been kept under virtual house arrest by israel for almost three years .
he had been in a coma since the middle of last week and had been placed on a life support machine .
arafat , who was born in 1929 , was probably the world 's best known guerrilla leader who later won the nobel peace prize , but in the last years of his life he was dismissed as a " terrorist " by israel .
israel heralds death as " good news " israel described his death as good news for the middle east while us president george w. bush , who had boycotted arafat for the last four years , said his passing was " a significant moment in palestinian history . "
palestinian officials said arafat 's death would be marked by an unprecedented 40-day official mourning period .
a funeral will be held in cairo on friday before his body is flown back and buried in the muqata .
the palestinian flag was flying at half-mast at the muqata and local television broadcast verses from the koran , the muslim tradition on the death of leading figures .
parliament speaker rawhi fattuh is to serve as caretaker leader of the palestinian authority for 60 days , after which new elections must be held .
former prime minister mahmud abbas will automatically take over as permanent head of both arafat 's dominant fatah faction and the palestine liberation organisation -lrb- plo -rrb- upon arafat 's death , while current premier , ahmed qureia , will head up the national security council .
amid fears that arafat 's death could trigger an outbreak of unrest , the israeli army imposed a total security clampdown on the west bank .
thousands of people took to the streets of gaza city after the announcement of his death , unleashing volleys of gunfire into the air and setting fire to tyres , turning the air pitch black .
ramallah grieving deeply in ramallah , a growing crowd of mainly youths gathered outside the gates of arafat 's headquarters , which overnight had been plastered with posters of the only leader palestinians had ever known .
french president jacques chirac led the tributes to arafat , announcing he would go to the percy military hospital to " pay a final homage to president arafat . "
" i have learned with emotion of the death of president yassir arafat , first president of the palestinian authority , " chirac said in a statement .
" with him disappears a man of courage and conviction who for 40 years incarnated the palestinians ' fight for recognition of their national rights . "
among the first governments to pay tribute was indonesia , home to the world 's largest muslim population .
" it is with great sorrow and profound sadness that we learned of the demise of president yasser arafat , the leader of palestine and a hero to us all , " said foreign ministry spokesman marty natalegawa .
however israel , which has long accused arafat of being the main obstacle to peace in the middle east , did not try to mask its delight at his death .
death of ' terror ' leader welcomed " the sun is shining in the middle east and around the world , as arafat was not only the leader of terrorism against israel , but also the founding father of the terrorism that is running rampant around the world right now , including that of al-qaeda , " justice minister tommy lapid said .
" all this terrorism is the fruit of arafat 's work , and it 's good that the world is rid of him . "
israeli president moshe katsav struck a more diplomatic line , expressing hope that a post-arafat " palestinian leadership will take a new path with a view to putting an end to terrorism and violence , which would allow a resumption of negotiations . "
bush , who has previously dismissed arafat as a failure , said he hoped his death would lead to an upturn in palestinian fortunes .
" for the palestinian people , we hope that the future will bring peace and the fulfillment of their aspirations for an independent , democratic palestine that is at peace with its neighbors , " bush said in a statement .
" during the period of transition that is ahead , we urge all in the region and throughout the world to join in helping make progress toward these goals and toward the ultimate goal of peace . "
martyrs to avenge " assassination " al-aqsa martyrs brigades , an armed offshoot of arafat 's fatah movement , urged its fighters to attack israel to avenge the " zionist assassination " .
" zionist israel and the government of -lrb- israeli prime minister ariel -rrb- sharon are responsible for the assassination of our leader by putting him under siege , " it said in a statement .
leaders react to arafat 's death world leaders and figures were quick to offer their views on the death of arafat .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said , " an era has ended ...
everything must be done now to achieve an orderly transfer of power .
of utmost importance is a leadership , made legitimate through early elections , which remains committed to a fair peace settlement . "
britain 's prime minister tony blair urged the palestinains and israelis to work towards peace after the loss of arafat .
" president arafat came to symbolise the palestinian national movement .
he led his people to an historic acceptance of the need for a two-state solution .
that goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . "
a spokesperson for kofi annan , the un secretary general , said he offered his condolences and added : " the secretary general was deeply moved to learn of the death of president yasser arafat .
president arafat was one of those few leaders who could be instantly recognised by people in any walk of life all around the world .
for nearly four decades , he expressed and symbolized in his person the national aspirations of the palestinian people . "
the statement from the un continued : " president arafat will always be remembered for having , in 1988 , led the palestinians to accept the principle of peaceful coexistence between israel and a future palestinian state .
by signing the oslo accords in 1993 he took a giant step towards the realisation of this vision .
it is tragic that he did not live to see it fulfilled .
now that he has gone , both israelis and palestinians , and the friends of both peoples throughout the world , must make even greater efforts to bring about the peaceful realisation of the palestinian right of self-determination .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all .

on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all .

in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .

" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .

" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .

doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .
he remained the undisputed leader of the palestinian people , a symbolic figure who maintained an iron grip on power , thus ensuring that his is an act it will be difficult , if not impossible , to follow . peter phillip / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .
he remained the undisputed leader of the palestinian people , a symbolic figure who maintained an iron grip on power , thus ensuring that his is an act it will be difficult , if not impossible , to follow . peter phillip / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?
ailing palestinian leader yasser arafat has been flown to paris for medical treatment .
even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician .
-lrb- october 29 , 2004 -rrb- eu angered by call to expel arafat israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all .

in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.11.2004 a test of faith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men engaged in a dark test of will and of faith a priest is granted a nine-day furlough from the nazi camp dachau , but is forced to make a terrible choice .
the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .

the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .
the development minister called for additional support for education , poverty eradication and economic revitalization that she said are crucial in an effective strategy aimed at limiting the spread of the disease . sabine ripperger -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-aids groups face new challenges german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .
the development minister called for additional support for education , poverty eradication and economic revitalization that she said are crucial in an effective strategy aimed at limiting the spread of the disease . sabine ripperger -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-aids groups face new challenges german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms .

27 , 2004 -rrb- young germans face rising hiv rates after falling for several years , rates of hiv infection , particularly among young gay men , are rising again .
risky behavior is increasing as a new generation appears willing to close its eyes to the dangers of hiv / aids .

and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .

and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .
" it is legitimate to go to the doctor , people would rather go there than to a psychologist or a priest , " dr. effertz said .
cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .
" there is now an obvious hurdle for people to go to the doctor , they observe their symptoms more closely and wait to see if they go away before seeking medical help , " dr. linnig told dw-world . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .

" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .

" rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis .

about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .

subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .
while 60 percent of americans say that religion plays an important role in their lives , only 20 percent of germans feel the same . uli bentele , tagesschau.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .

" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 german radical christians look to us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am the lord , thy god , " reads the election campaign poster while fundamentalist christians played a vital role in the re-election of us president george w. bush , their german counterparts have so far failed to gain any political significance .
some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective . " it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .

some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective . " it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 a passion for prescriptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the common cold is an ailment germans give serious attention to as the last autumn leaves flutter to the ground dragging germany headlong into winter , patients across the country are preparing for their annual love affair with the doctors ' waiting room . call it a passion , an obsession or merely a healthy interest , there is no getting away from the fact that germans nurture a very loving relationship with their physical wellbeing .
and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .
" it is legitimate to go to the doctor , people would rather go there than to a psychologist or a priest , " dr. effertz said .
cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .
" there is now an obvious hurdle for people to go to the doctor , they observe their symptoms more closely and wait to see if they go away before seeking medical help , " dr. linnig told dw-world . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis .

" if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.11.2004 a test of faith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men engaged in a dark test of will and of faith a priest is granted a nine-day furlough from the nazi camp dachau , but is forced to make a terrible choice .
the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice . " the ninth day " -lrb- " der neunte tag , " germany , 2004 -rrb- director : volker schlöndorff .
screenplay : eberhard görner , andreas pflüger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 german radical christians look to us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am the lord , thy god , " reads the election campaign poster while fundamentalist christians played a vital role in the re-election of us president george w. bush , their german counterparts have so far failed to gain any political significance .
some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective . " it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .
while 60 percent of americans say that religion plays an important role in their lives , only 20 percent of germans feel the same . uli bentele , tagesschau.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .

" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .

farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .

amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .

some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective .

us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .

subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .
while 60 percent of americans say that religion plays an important role in their lives , only 20 percent of germans feel the same . uli bentele , tagesschau.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .
while 60 percent of americans say that religion plays an important role in their lives , only 20 percent of germans feel the same . uli bentele , tagesschau.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice . " the ninth day " -lrb- " der neunte tag , " germany , 2004 -rrb- director : volker schlöndorff .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible .

of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .

" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .

the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .

the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 a passion for prescriptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the common cold is an ailment germans give serious attention to as the last autumn leaves flutter to the ground dragging germany headlong into winter , patients across the country are preparing for their annual love affair with the doctors ' waiting room . call it a passion , an obsession or merely a healthy interest , there is no getting away from the fact that germans nurture a very loving relationship with their physical wellbeing .
and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .
" it is legitimate to go to the doctor , people would rather go there than to a psychologist or a priest , " dr. effertz said .
cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .
" there is now an obvious hurdle for people to go to the doctor , they observe their symptoms more closely and wait to see if they go away before seeking medical help , " dr. linnig told dw-world . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice . " the ninth day " -lrb- " der neunte tag , " germany , 2004 -rrb- director : volker schlöndorff .
screenplay : eberhard görner , andreas pflüger .
starring : ulrich matthes , august diehl , bibiana beglau , germain wagner , jean-paul raths .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .
" it is legitimate to go to the doctor , people would rather go there than to a psychologist or a priest , " dr. effertz said .
cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .
" there is now an obvious hurdle for people to go to the doctor , they observe their symptoms more closely and wait to see if they go away before seeking medical help , " dr. linnig told dw-world . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .
he remained the undisputed leader of the palestinian people , a symbolic figure who maintained an iron grip on power , thus ensuring that his is an act it will be difficult , if not impossible , to follow . peter phillip / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?

tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .
he remained the undisputed leader of the palestinian people , a symbolic figure who maintained an iron grip on power , thus ensuring that his is an act it will be difficult , if not impossible , to follow . peter phillip / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?
ailing palestinian leader yasser arafat has been flown to paris for medical treatment .
even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician .
-lrb- october 29 , 2004 -rrb- eu angered by call to expel arafat israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac .

without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .
while 60 percent of americans say that religion plays an important role in their lives , only 20 percent of germans feel the same . uli bentele , tagesschau.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .

currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all .

though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .

" after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .

" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana .

the european parliament meanwhile has launched its own anti-racism group . high on the conference 's agenda is the exchange of " best practices " with regard to the integration of ethnic minorities .
delegates of the two-day meeting , which ends thursday , are trying to come up with ways to make immigrants feel more welcome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita verdonk " we do not want to simply focus on a theoretical framework , but find an approach that really works , " rita verdonk -lrb- photo -rrb- , dutch integration minister , said at the opening .
" how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ? " parliamentary group meanwhile , the european parliament ’ s anti-racism and diversity intergroup has been set up to ensure a parliamentary voice for millions of ethnic minority eu citizens .
its president , a uk mep of asian background , claude moraes , said there was an urgent need for such a group . " within the european parliament as with most national parliaments , there are very , very few ethnic minority meps , " he said , adding that only about a dozen out of more than 700 parliamentarians belonged to ethnic minorities .
" that means that we need to get together along with likeminded meps , who believe that anti-racism , issues of integration , issues around islamophobia , anti-semitism , the plight of the roma , all of these issues require an all-party , multi-party voice . " bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament the group has the backing of over 120 meps and key ethnic minority meps are vice-presidents of the group , including the german meps , cem özdemir and feleknas uca .
claude moraes said they will be able to highlight issues that aren ’ t currently receiving a lot of attention . germany , greece slow to change " most european union countries , including germany , have had difficulty in implementing anti-discrimination legislation , " he said .
" germany and greece for example have yet to implement the race equality directive , which bars discrimination on racial grounds , against european citizens .
we will be very bold in our group in identifying those countries which have yet to live up to those standards . " the group says it will provide a robust ethnic minority voice in europe at a critical and sensitive time on issues of integration , multiculturalism and the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration populist parties across the eu .
claude moraes believes a fear of tackling racism needs to be overcome . " people feel very afraid of these issues , they are very sensitive issues in germany and elsewhere and because of this , it 's very difficult sometimes for politicians to get together to ensure that we have a proper take on these issues , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 german radical christians look to us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am the lord , thy god , " reads the election campaign poster while fundamentalist christians played a vital role in the re-election of us president george w. bush , their german counterparts have so far failed to gain any political significance .
some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective . " it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .

rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.11.2004 a test of faith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men engaged in a dark test of will and of faith a priest is granted a nine-day furlough from the nazi camp dachau , but is forced to make a terrible choice .
the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice . " the ninth day " -lrb- " der neunte tag , " germany , 2004 -rrb- director : volker schlöndorff .
screenplay : eberhard görner , andreas pflüger .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 german radical christians look to us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am the lord , thy god , " reads the election campaign poster while fundamentalist christians played a vital role in the re-election of us president george w. bush , their german counterparts have so far failed to gain any political significance .
some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective . " it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 a passion for prescriptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the common cold is an ailment germans give serious attention to as the last autumn leaves flutter to the ground dragging germany headlong into winter , patients across the country are preparing for their annual love affair with the doctors ' waiting room . call it a passion , an obsession or merely a healthy interest , there is no getting away from the fact that germans nurture a very loving relationship with their physical wellbeing .
and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .
" it is legitimate to go to the doctor , people would rather go there than to a psychologist or a priest , " dr. effertz said .
cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .
" there is now an obvious hurdle for people to go to the doctor , they observe their symptoms more closely and wait to see if they go away before seeking medical help , " dr. linnig told dw-world . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.11.2004 a test of faith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men engaged in a dark test of will and of faith a priest is granted a nine-day furlough from the nazi camp dachau , but is forced to make a terrible choice .
the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .
he remained the undisputed leader of the palestinian people , a symbolic figure who maintained an iron grip on power , thus ensuring that his is an act it will be difficult , if not impossible , to follow . peter phillip / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?
ailing palestinian leader yasser arafat has been flown to paris for medical treatment .
even if he regains his health , his political life seems to have reached its end , said a leading german politician .
-lrb- october 29 , 2004 -rrb- eu angered by call to expel arafat israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 german radical christians look to us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am the lord , thy god , " reads the election campaign poster while fundamentalist christians played a vital role in the re-election of us president george w. bush , their german counterparts have so far failed to gain any political significance .
some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective . " it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .
while 60 percent of americans say that religion plays an important role in their lives , only 20 percent of germans feel the same . uli bentele , tagesschau.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.11.2004 blair heads to us to push bush on mideast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony and george , together again british prime minister tony blair headed to washington thursday for talks with us president george bush expected to focus on the future of middle east peace following the death of yasser arafat . blair left london in the afternoon and will hold talks with bush in the white house the following day , the first foreign leader to meet the re-elected president .
the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .

the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .

but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .

" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .

the european parliament meanwhile has launched its own anti-racism group . high on the conference 's agenda is the exchange of " best practices " with regard to the integration of ethnic minorities .
delegates of the two-day meeting , which ends thursday , are trying to come up with ways to make immigrants feel more welcome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita verdonk " we do not want to simply focus on a theoretical framework , but find an approach that really works , " rita verdonk -lrb- photo -rrb- , dutch integration minister , said at the opening .
" how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ? " parliamentary group meanwhile , the european parliament ’ s anti-racism and diversity intergroup has been set up to ensure a parliamentary voice for millions of ethnic minority eu citizens .
its president , a uk mep of asian background , claude moraes , said there was an urgent need for such a group . " within the european parliament as with most national parliaments , there are very , very few ethnic minority meps , " he said , adding that only about a dozen out of more than 700 parliamentarians belonged to ethnic minorities .
" that means that we need to get together along with likeminded meps , who believe that anti-racism , issues of integration , issues around islamophobia , anti-semitism , the plight of the roma , all of these issues require an all-party , multi-party voice . " bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament the group has the backing of over 120 meps and key ethnic minority meps are vice-presidents of the group , including the german meps , cem özdemir and feleknas uca .
claude moraes said they will be able to highlight issues that aren ’ t currently receiving a lot of attention . germany , greece slow to change " most european union countries , including germany , have had difficulty in implementing anti-discrimination legislation , " he said .
" germany and greece for example have yet to implement the race equality directive , which bars discrimination on racial grounds , against european citizens .
we will be very bold in our group in identifying those countries which have yet to live up to those standards . " the group says it will provide a robust ethnic minority voice in europe at a critical and sensitive time on issues of integration , multiculturalism and the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration populist parties across the eu .
claude moraes believes a fear of tackling racism needs to be overcome . " people feel very afraid of these issues , they are very sensitive issues in germany and elsewhere and because of this , it 's very difficult sometimes for politicians to get together to ensure that we have a proper take on these issues , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

the european parliament meanwhile has launched its own anti-racism group . high on the conference 's agenda is the exchange of " best practices " with regard to the integration of ethnic minorities .
delegates of the two-day meeting , which ends thursday , are trying to come up with ways to make immigrants feel more welcome . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita verdonk " we do not want to simply focus on a theoretical framework , but find an approach that really works , " rita verdonk -lrb- photo -rrb- , dutch integration minister , said at the opening .
" how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ? " parliamentary group meanwhile , the european parliament ’ s anti-racism and diversity intergroup has been set up to ensure a parliamentary voice for millions of ethnic minority eu citizens .
its president , a uk mep of asian background , claude moraes , said there was an urgent need for such a group . " within the european parliament as with most national parliaments , there are very , very few ethnic minority meps , " he said , adding that only about a dozen out of more than 700 parliamentarians belonged to ethnic minorities .
" that means that we need to get together along with likeminded meps , who believe that anti-racism , issues of integration , issues around islamophobia , anti-semitism , the plight of the roma , all of these issues require an all-party , multi-party voice . " bildunterschrift : general view of the european parliament the group has the backing of over 120 meps and key ethnic minority meps are vice-presidents of the group , including the german meps , cem özdemir and feleknas uca .
claude moraes said they will be able to highlight issues that aren ’ t currently receiving a lot of attention . germany , greece slow to change " most european union countries , including germany , have had difficulty in implementing anti-discrimination legislation , " he said .
" germany and greece for example have yet to implement the race equality directive , which bars discrimination on racial grounds , against european citizens .
we will be very bold in our group in identifying those countries which have yet to live up to those standards . " the group says it will provide a robust ethnic minority voice in europe at a critical and sensitive time on issues of integration , multiculturalism and the rise of the far-right and anti-immigration populist parties across the eu .
claude moraes believes a fear of tackling racism needs to be overcome . " people feel very afraid of these issues , they are very sensitive issues in germany and elsewhere and because of this , it 's very difficult sometimes for politicians to get together to ensure that we have a proper take on these issues , " he said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .

of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .

" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 german radical christians look to us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i am the lord , thy god , " reads the election campaign poster while fundamentalist christians played a vital role in the re-election of us president george w. bush , their german counterparts have so far failed to gain any political significance .
some experts say that could change . " i pray every day , i read the bible every morning … my faith gives me focus and perspective . " it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .

" it 's questionable whether a candidate for the german chancellorship would be able to run a successful campaign with such statements - even if he or she belonged to a party that carries the christian " c " in its name , such as the country 's largest opposition party , the christian democratic union and her bavarian sister , the christian social union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then texas gov. george w. bush bows his head in prayer before speaking during a service at the second baptist church in houston in 1999 .
us president george w. bush , on the other hand , managed to win re-election partly because he said exactly that .
without massive support from the religious right he would not have beaten john kerry .
about three-quarters of conservative christians voted republican . in germany , radical christians have so far played a negligible role in the political process and it remains unclear whether that will change in the future . minute support in germany the partei bibeltreuer christen -lrb- pbc -rrb- , or party of christians true to the bible , could be seen as the closest german equivalent to politically active and bush-supporting us christians .
the tiny party mainly attracts attention because of its idiosyncratic tv spots and its lack of supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pbc poster for the european parliament elections in elections for european parliament in june , the most recent nation-wide elections , the political mouthpiece of radical christians got 0.38 percent of the vote .
subtracting the odd joke voter here and there , the number of pbc followers can be called minute so far .
during the 2002 general elections , the party failed to even reach the 0.1 percent mark , with only about 15,000 people giving pbc their vote . pbc leader gerhard heinzmann , who has no problem being labelled a christian fundamentalist , said he was pleased with bush 's re-election . " there 's an extraordinary agreement on issues between our supporters and bush voters , " heinzmann said , citing opposition to gay marriage and abortion as examples .
both groups " not only elect their government , but also pray for its members , " he said .
and that 's what counts , he added . hoping to follow the us example the pbc 's 5,000 registered members would like to profit from their politically successful us brothers and sisters in faith : according to experts , 20 to 30 percent of americans can be described as fundamental christians .
but heinzmann said he did n't expect this to happen . " german christians believe that they do n't have a role to play in politics and unfortunately that 's not going to change , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush speaks during a tribute to the life and legacy of slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. at a baptist church in 2003 .
bush himself is a member of the united methodist church , which is represented in germany as the evangelisch-methodistische kirche -lrb- emk -rrb- , or evangelical methodist church .
in the us , methodists have repeatedly signalled their political independence by pointing out areas in which they disagree with the bush administration .
issues such as the death penalty and the war in iraq led bush 's church on a collision course with the president . walter klaiber , who currently heads the emk as bishop , said he saw a need for the church to be politically active , but added that such involvement should be limited to issues and should not include support for individual politicians .
the emk 's us counterpart seems to follow the same policy and did not endorse bush - unlike many other radical religious splinter groups . a new christian right ? experts differ on the number of supporters of small christian congregations that aim to establish radical christendom in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while hundreds of thousands of german christians gathered in berlin for an ecumenical convention in 2003 , church pews remain empty most sundays .
rüdiger hauth , who monitors religious sects for the evangelical church , germany 's largest protestant church , in the western german region of westphalia , said there are ten thousands of supporters .
but richard ziegert , hauth 's colleague from the southwestern region of palatinate , believes that there are more than 250,000 radical christians in the country and us missionaries are increasingly coming to germany to spread the word . " these are sectarian groups that do n't work for the benefit of the public , " ziegert said , adding that they were mainly concerned with merging politics and capitalism to reap the largest possible profit . experts also differ whether these groups will start becoming more politically active in the future .
both hauth and klaiber said they do n't believe they will .
but ziegert said he expected to see a growing political with backing from the us . " the new christian right is in the midst of forming , " he said . it 's impossible , however , to impose the us societal fabric on germany .
while 60 percent of americans say that religion plays an important role in their lives , only 20 percent of germans feel the same . uli bentele , tagesschau.de -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2004 a passion for prescriptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the common cold is an ailment germans give serious attention to as the last autumn leaves flutter to the ground dragging germany headlong into winter , patients across the country are preparing for their annual love affair with the doctors ' waiting room . call it a passion , an obsession or merely a healthy interest , there is no getting away from the fact that germans nurture a very loving relationship with their physical wellbeing .
and at no time of year does this become more apparent than when the nights begin to draw in and the skies to cloud over .
" germans definitely go to the doctors too often , " general practitioner dr. beate effertz , told dw-world .
" at least 70 percent of people who visit the doctor in germany could stay at home .
that 's not to say that they do n't have a problem , they do , but what they really need is to talk , and because they do n't do that , they develop symptoms which lead them to the doctor , " she added .
and the very design of the system acts like a magnet on those troubled souls who feel the need to keep returning to their gp in search of a wonder cure .
" it is legitimate to go to the doctor , people would rather go there than to a psychologist or a priest , " dr. effertz said .
cultural sickness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slippers are a german winter must .
but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .

but that 's only part of the picture , as many visits to the doctor at this time of year are the product of a national culture of acquiring petit illness .
from the earliest age , children in germany are taught that sickness ensues from such daring acts as venturing outside with wet hair , failing to wear slippers in the home , or walking the winter streets baring any naked flesh besides hands and face .
dr. effertz believes that people often fall into the trap of becoming sick simply because they believe they have violated the code of german winter dressing , adding that there is no real basis for such illness , and that the body can be trained to deal with all kinds of climatic conditions given half the chance .
competition rules but even doctors who are unwilling to prescribe medication for the sake of it , are at the mercy of a system rooted in competition .
gps are paid on a per-patient basis , so ultimately the more sickness they deal with , the healthier their businesses stand to become .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : single packs of tissues are a firm favorite in germany general practitioner dr. stefan linnig says doctors know their own vulnerability and even when dealing with sicknesses such as the common cold , which essentially just has to run its course , they are obliged to take it seriously .
" as a doctor , you ca n't tell them to pull themselves together , you have to keep their spirits up , or run the risk of them choosing a different doctor , " dr linng said .
farewell to the good times for a long time , the luxury german healthcare system not only cured illness , but also fed it .
doctors had their patients and patients had their doctors , but together they were gradually bleeding the state health insurance companies dry .
at the start of this year , in a bid to heal the ailing coffers , the government introduced a mandatory € 10 -lrb- $ 12.9 -rrb- quarterly fee - to be paid on top of health insurance contributions - for those wishing to visit the doctor .
amidst cries that such a fee would take its toll on low earners , and lead to more sickness overall , the new system met with rigid resistance from both doctors ' and patients ' camps alike .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new fee could be the first step to a cure .
but nine months down the line , there have been no epidemics and there is even a feeling among some doctors that the fee has been a good thing .
" there is now an obvious hurdle for people to go to the doctor , they observe their symptoms more closely and wait to see if they go away before seeking medical help , " dr. linnig told dw-world . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany well-prepared for flu season even as the us struggles to stock up on influenza vaccines this year , germany can boast of more than sufficient supplies of flu shots .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .

but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .
he has also tried to persuade bush to do more to combat global warming since washington rejected the kyoto protocol . with recent british military casualties in iraq helping to make the war there more unpopular than ever at home , according to one opinion poll this week , blair 's close ties to bush are causing him problems ahead of a likely british election next year .
however , in an interview shortly before his departure thursday , blair stressed that this was merely " part of my job " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and british prime minister tony blair , left , meet in the oval office at the white house in washington , friday , april 16 , 2004 .
" the relationship between britain and the us is fantastically important , " blair said in an interview with the gmtv television program .
" you know , i think there always is , and always should be , a situation in which the british prime minister and the american president get on well together .
i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis . " if blair had any sense , he will be talking about what it is exactly that they will get from the israelis to make the palestinian situation more viable , " she said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sees new chance for peace after arafat german foreign policy experts predict that the end of the arafat era will bring a fresh start for the middle east peace process , as well as german mediation efforts .

arafat was being treated there for an unknown illness . the frail head of the palestinian authority arrived in paris last week after losing consciousness briefly at his west bank headquarters . arafat was at first said to have been suffering from a severe case of influenza , but was later diagnosed as having blood abnormalities and trouble with digestion . palestinian officials then ran tests for leukemia but the cancer was ruled out , and doctors remained uncertain what was causing his illness .
radical wings of his fatah movement continue to claim arafat was poisoned but medical tests have shown no evidence to support that .
arafat 's condition worsened three days ago and he slipped into a coma on wednesday . born in cairo in 1929 , yasser arafat preferred to claim jerusalem as his birthplace .
he became politically active as a 19-year-old engineering student in egypt in 1948 , when the arab countries that declared war on the fledgling state of israel were defeated and thousands of palestinians forced to flee their homes as a result . founder of the fatah movement arafat and a small group of supporters founded the fatah movement in kuwait in 1959 .
five years later , the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- was established by arab governments claiming to represent palestinian interests . shortly after this came a turning point in palestinian history .
tensions between israel and its arab neighbors culminated in 1967 in the six day war , by the end of which israeli forces had occupied east jerusalem and the west bank - which until then had been administered by jordan - as well as the gaza strip and the golan heights . president of the plo fatah joined the plo , and arafat became president of the organization in 1969 , a position he held for the rest of his life .
he became a hero to many palestinians by personally rallying resistance in the west bank and organizing attacks against israelis .
the plo was forced to shift its base from jordan to lebanon in 1970 , and in 1982 , when israel invaded lebanon , it set up headquarters in tunis . during the 1970s and ' 80s , the plo and other affiliated groups attracted international attention with a series of terrorist acts and violent hijackings .
these included the murder of eleven israeli athletes at the munich olympics in 1972 , the hijacking of a french airliner in entebbe in 1976 , and of the achille lauro cruise ship in 1985 . but exiled in tunisia , arafat began to lose his grip on the palestinian territories .
militant islamist groups like hamas appeared to fill the void .
in 1987 , the palestinians themselves started a civil uprising or " intifada " against the israeli occupation , for which arafat managed to take much of the credit . head of the self-proclaimed independent state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1988 the plo unilaterally declared an independent palestinian state with arafat as its president , but real progress towards this goal only began a few years later , when arafat , under international pressure , finally acknowledged israel ’ s right to exist and declared that the plo would distance itself from terrorism . the plo was then invited to observe the middle east peace talks in madrid in 1991 , and secret negotiations led to the triumphant signing of the oslo peace accords in 1993 .
arafat and the plo were allowed to return to the occupied territories and set up an autonomous administration .
in 1994 , arafat shared the nobel peace prize with his israeli counterpart , yitzhak rabin . arafat faced many israeli leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabin , clinton and arafat .
but the peace process ground to a halt when yitzhak rabin was murdered the following year , and his successor , benjamin netanyahu , stalled the implementation of the oslo agreement .
in 2000 , new israeli premier ehud barak met arafat at the ill-fated camp david summit to negotiate the boundaries of a palestinian state . many believe that arafat ’ s decision to reject barak ’ s offer outright without making a counter-proposal was his biggest political mistake ; but his refusal to compromise meant he returned home to a hero ’ s welcome , albeit empty-handed . second intifada marginalized arafat shortly afterwards , in september 2000 , the second intifada broke out .
although arafat officially condemned acts of terrorism , including palestinian suicide bombings and attacks against civilians , the israeli government under hardliner ariel sharon held him responsible , and isolated him within his compound in ramallah for nearly two and a half years . arafat continued to defy not only israel but also parkinson ’ s disease , power struggles within the plo and repeated accusations of corruption .
he remained the undisputed leader of the palestinian people , a symbolic figure who maintained an iron grip on power , thus ensuring that his is an act it will be difficult , if not impossible , to follow . peter phillip / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de time for a change in palestinian leadership ?

the early visit cements blair 's reputation as the us leader 's closest ally , but also risks further charges back home that he is simply a us " poodle " . blair faces intense domestic pressure to reap some benefits from his strong support for the unpopular us-led war in iraq , and hinted before his departure that the middle east was where he expected to find this . " peace in the middle east must be the international community 's highest priority , " blair said in a statement following arafat 's death .
the palestinian leader died in a paris hospital in the early hours of thursday .
blair reiterated his call for action in the region , saying that " the goal of a viable palestinian state alongside a secure israel is one that we must continue to work tirelessly to achieve . " on the plane to washington , blair 's spokesman said the prime minister saw a " new era " for the peace process .
" there is a moment and that moment is to send a signal to the region we are serious about " peace in the middle east , he told journalists on board the flight . " if the world sees president bush and the prime minister saying they are very serious on this issue and we are committed to it , that helps , " the spokesman said . peace and environment a priority for the past year and a half , blair has pledged to make the revival of the peace process a personal priority .

i regard it as part of my job . " nonetheless , analysts are skeptical about whether blair could return to london bearing anything tangible which might assuage his critics .
john kampfner , a blair biographer and political journalist , said that although bush had always " politely heard " blair 's case , he generally did little . dividends for london ? while the americans understood that blair 's unflinching loyalty to bush on iraq had " brought no dividends and only political flak " , they also had to put their own support for israel into the balance , kampfner said .
" whatever -lrb- blair -rrb- might bring home may only be wafer-thin . " rosemary hollis , head of the middle east program at the royal institute of international affairs think tank in london , said blair would be satisfied to achieve any " reinvigorated process " pointing towards a two-state peace .
" but i suspect they 're not going to go into any details on exactly what that means on the map , " she warned . she said the united states and israel would have to do much more this time to support a " moderate " like mahmud abbas , known as abu mazen , the former prime minister who brokered a truce with radical palestinian factions but failed to win much in return from the israelis .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .
more then 25 million of them live in sub-saharan africa .
the area is fast becoming a region of orphans - 12 million children there have lost one or both of their parents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman in a hospice for poor aids / hiv patients in the northern ukrainian city of odessa besides africa , eastern europe and the former soviet union have become hiv / aids hotspots , with groups lower on the socioeconomic ladder being primarily effected , especially women and children . the number of new cases continues to rise , five million were reported last year alone . hopeful signs germany is active in the anti-aids fight in 50 countries and after the usa and the uk , is the third largest contributor of funds aimed at addressing the epidemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex workers wait to attend a aids awareness function held by an ngo at a go-go bar in bangkok , thailand while the sheer number of cases and continual rise in new infections can seem overwhelming , wieczorek-zeul said there have been positive trends in several countries in recent years that are encouraging .
she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said . " the idea , that one hears talked about in several countries , that prevention is only achieved through ' abstinence and faithfulness ' is surely a good and pious wish , but it does not address the reality of many people 's lives , " she said . she gave the example of a woman who herself might be faithful , but whose husband has several sexual partners .
in this case this woman 's faithfulness , she said , does little to protect her from infection .
the only sure way to do that , she added , is with a condom . germany supports the distribution of low-cost condoms in 20 countries and increasingly , the development ministry is working on initiatives that distribute free medication or set up partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and companies in developing countries to produce cheaper aids drugs . brazil as model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousand of students painted a giant flag to commemorate world aids day in brasilia , brazil wieczorek-zeul had words of praise for brazil 's aids policies and programs , which she said had drastically reduced the infection rate there .
since 1995 , the country has run a comprehensive therapy and treatment program that provides medicines to people living with aids free of charge . additional campaigns by the government and ngo 's aimed at education and prevention have over the long term resulted in a falling infection rate .
currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .

today , that amount has risen to € 300 million annually and will be increased , according to development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , since checking the spread of the epidemic is a priority of germany 's development ministry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul wieczorek-zeul , speaking to reporters in berlin on wednesday , said the german government was committed to the goal set by the international community to stop the rise in hiv / aids cases by 2015 . statistics from 2003 show that worldwide some 38 million people are have hiv , the virus that leads to aids .

she named the reduction of infection rates in uganda and thailand , as well as efforts in treatment and prevention in brazil . " with treatment , lives are being prolonged so that children have their parents with them for longer and hiv-positive people can lead longer , fuller lives , " she said . prevention is key the development minister was very direct in addressing the important of realistic preventive efforts to stop the spread of the disease , particularly when it came to women .
the only way to protect oneself and sexual partners against hiv / aids is through the use of condoms , she said .

currently in brazil the rate is 0.7 percent , compared to 38 percent in botswana . " it shows us that this kind of targeted , comprehensive approach is successful , " she said . brazil 's success could prove a model for neighboring countries in south and central america , she added . but therapy and prevention efforts are not the only weapons in the fight against aids in the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.11.2004 a test of faith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men engaged in a dark test of will and of faith a priest is granted a nine-day furlough from the nazi camp dachau , but is forced to make a terrible choice .
the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice .

the film " the ninth day " explores tensions between the church and the nazis , betrayal and the will to survive . during the nazi period , around 3,000 clergy throughout europe who did not go along with the ruling regime were imprisoned in concentration camps .
volker schlöndorff 's new film , " the ninth day , " is based loosely on the memoirs of one of those men , forced to choose between following his conscience or perhaps saving his and his family 's life .
the director , who won an oscar for his 1979 film " the tin drum , " has created a disturbing snapshot of relations between the church and hitler 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich matthes as father henri kremer in the film , opening on thursday in theaters , ulrich matthes -lrb- photo -rrb- plays henri kremer , a priest from luxembourg enduring the horrors of dachau with others in the " clergy block . "
he is suddenly granted nine days ' leave from this particular hell and allowed to return home . but kremer 's furlough is not due to any sudden paroxysm of mercy on the part of the nazis ; their designs are much darker .
every day during kremer 's nine days of freedom he must report to a young ss man , gebhardt , whose assignment is to get kremer to convince the luxembourg church to collaborate with the new european masters . to keep kremer from simply disappearing during his furlough , his nazi captors threaten to kill his fellow clergymen and harm his family if he does not report to gebhardt as required . war of words thus begins a dark chamber drama revolving around the verbal swordplay between the two men , which gains intensity daily .
the weapons of the men , who find themselves on opposite sides of the reigning power dynamic but who both share a belief in god , are their arguments , and both have powerful arsenals on hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august diehl as ss-man gebhardt gestapo officer gebhardt , who once entertained thoughts of entering the priesthood , is not portrayed as a simple demon but given a dash of humanity .
he attempts to bring the priest over to his side with arguments that prove surprisingly persuasive and darkly tempting .
both men have much at stake - one risks his career , one his conscience or perhaps his soul . a debate over the figure of judas is one of the film 's most powerful scenes , since gebhardt argues that without judas ' actions , there would have been no crucifixion , the central event of christianity .
judas , the nazi argues , was an important cog in the wheel of history , no mere traitor . dark palette and portrayals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diehl , bibiana beglau , matthes -lrb- from left -rrb- the movie has a somber , claustrophobic feel , helped by the director 's chosen palette , made up mostly of variations of gray .
the only intense color is the bloody red on the nazi flag or flowing from wounds of tortured concentration camp inmates . august diehl as gebhardt , blond haired and blue eyed , portrays a cultured , educated man , but one whose moral tether has been undone by rampant careerism and cold calculation .
ulrich matthes is able to show the mental and physical turmoil father kremer suffers through his emaciated face , slow , deliberate gate , and eyes that appear haunted , unable to face his nearly unbearable choice . " the ninth day " -lrb- " der neunte tag , " germany , 2004 -rrb- director : volker schlöndorff .

the ruling conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said the ban , which has already been introduced in four of germany 's 16 federal states , was designed to protect pupils from the influence of islamic fundamentalism .
" the veil is widely abused by islamic fundamentalist groups as a political symbol , " said bavaria 's culture minister , monika hohlmeier .
the social democratic party and greens , who rule in a coalition on a national level , voted against the ban in the regional parliament and said it was questionable from a legal point of view .
headscarf bans for teachers have already been introduced in the states of hesse , lower saxony , baden-württemberg and saarland .
in hesse the ban applies to all civil servants .
however , the bans stop short of banning school pupils from wearing islamic headscarves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 11.11.2004 when germans shot germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter fechter , the border 's first victim , killed in berlin in 1962 germany ended one of its ugliest chapters when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
but like dozens before them , they received no punishment . the sm70 was one of the east german border 's most effective killing machines - no one knew that better than those who designed and developed the automatic-fire weapon . on tuesday , four former military technicians , between the ages of 63 and 71 , were convicted of accessory to murder for their part in developing and maintaining the machine , which had been placed along the east german border .
but they received no sentence for the fatal injuries their machines dealt four people trying to cross the border during the 1980s . saying that the suspects were not " ice-cold , inhuman " killers like other members of the east german military leadership , the prosecutor in the case called for nothing more than a " symbolic conviction , " which the judge granted . the decision , coming in the same week when germany celebrates 15 years since the fall of the berlin wall , was one victims ' organizations have gotten used to .
waning political will and , critics say , a german justice system that is too merciful has meant that most of the 112 trails over deaths at the border between east and west germany have ended in suspended sentences or no punishment at all . " the law completely failed in its duty , " said harald strunz , who heads the umbrella organization responsible for gdr victims .
" only a laughably small percentage of the suspects have been held responsible . " aggressive prosecution , mild sentences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one cross for every victim of the border , set up at the checkpoint charlie museum in berlin in october 2004 the balance since 1991:128 people of a total of 246 have been convicted for crimes relating to deaths on the east german border .
of that number , 10 were part of the political leadership .
former defense minister heinz kessler received 7.5 years in prison , the harshest punishment .
egon krenz , the successor to gdr leader erich honecker , received 6.5 years and klaus-dieter baumgarten , the hawkish head of the east german border troops also got a 6.5 year sentence . of the rest , around 80 were border soldiers who received suspended sentences or no sentences whatsoever .
in 65 cases , judges declared the suspects innocent . sentencing laws in germany that are focused on the suspect rather than the victims ' suffering account for the smaller sentences , said christoph schaefgen , berlin 's former chief prosecutor responsible for investigating crimes in the former east germany .
though satisfied with the prosecution record , schaefgen said he wished for strong sentences . " that we were able to personalize the injustice and individualize the guilt of the regime was certainly a success , " schaefgen said .
on the other hand , he conceded that " the punishment went in favor of the suspects and that we could have done that differently . " after the wall fell , west german prosecutors were faced with the dilemma of whether they were allowed to charge someone with a crime that was n't considered one in the country where it was committed .
west german lawyers went all the way to the european court of human rights , which sided with the argument that legislation so contrary to international law should be disregarded . border guards suffered , too the first border guard trial began in 1991 , involving four soldiers responsible for killing chris gueffroy , 20 , the last person to die while fleeing east germany on feb .
5 , 1989 .
two of the four guards were cleared ; the other two eventually received suspended sentences .
the pattern was to repeat itself over the next 13 years . many argued that the political leadership , not the border guards , should have been the focus of the prosecution all along .
" border , " a documentary appearing in german movie theaters this week , argues that border guards were forced , on punishment of prison time , to serve .
the theory has been questioned by former east german soldiers , who said that guards volunteered for border duty . " i think the majority of the conscripts put in that situation were n't thinking , only acting , when they shot at border crossers , " said holger jancke , the film 's writer and director , who was himself a border guard .
" they will live with the consequences of their actions for the rest of their life .
in this sense , i think that 's enough punishment . " of the 112 prosecuted , 38 were members of the gdr military leadership .
doing what one could " i think we did what was possible , " schaefgen said .
the retired prosecutor said he regretted the decision by a berlin judge on tuesday , something he attributed to the 15 years that have passed since the wall came down .
following reunification , germany 's political leadership was more aggressive about going after and punishing east german government criminals , schaefgen said .
that gradually ebbed with time and a changing political landscape . " it was also always a political question : how aggressively will we go after this ? " he said . for some victims ' families the answer will continue to be : not aggressively enough . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

the home grown search site rolls together many of the features and customisation tools seen on other search sites .
initially , it has launched just a prototype , but the finished version will be ready by the end of 2004 .
microsoft plans to use the search site as a springboard to take a significant share of the advertising market from rivals google and yahoo .
search wars in july this year , microsoft updated and tidied up its msn search page to remove unwanted adverts and to speed up the returning of results .
that search engine was based on technology provided by yahoo and microsoft will soon drop that in favour of its own home-grown search engine .
microsoft has been testing this own-brand search tool since july and now has launched a test version .
in a statement microsoft said its search engine returned results from five billion web pages - more than any other search engine .
but this quickly won a response from google which announced that its index has now grown to more than 8 billion pages .
prior to the microsoft announcement , google was only indexing 4,285,199,774 web pages .
as well as a large number of pages , the microsoft search engine , which operates under the msn banner , also includes a number of features that have already been seen on other search sites .
any which way results returned by the msn search engine will be arranged according to categories .
users will be able to flip between different results , such as web , news and images , by clicking on tabs .
also on hand will be menus to help refine searches according to countries or languages .
google is king of the search space microsoft will also include what it has dubbed " graphic equalisers " that let people emphasise different characteristics of results such as ones that are more popular or more recent .
the search site will also return canned results for discrete queries such as capital cities and other well known facts plus definitions , calculations , conversions and solutions to equations .
ask jeeves has been offering similar services for some time .
tony macklin , director of product at ask jeeves , said : " the level of investment required of both time and money to enter this market shows it is clearly not an easy accomplishment . "
he said many users would probably not notice the difference between the new msn search engine and the old yahoo-based one .
" we do not expect the replacement itself to turn the search market upside down , " he said .
the search market has become much more competitive in 2004 , largely because so many organisations realise that the main thing that web users do is search for information .
research carried out by ask jeeves suggests that 80 % of what people do on the web begins at a search site .
' we will surpass ' this also explains the recent interest in personal search systems that catalogue everything people have on their home computer .
firms such as blinkx , copernic , enfish , x1 and google and others have all released programs that index all the files on your pc .
microsoft has yet to launch its version of this type of software .
microsoft hopes that its msn search will take a significant share of the advertising revenue that google currently generates .
at its recent annual shareholder meeting microsoft chief executive steve ballmer said the company would take on google directly .
" we think there is a heck of a lot of great new innovation in the search space , " said mr ballmer .
" we will catch up .
we will surpass . "
but microsoft has a long way to go to catch google not least because so many people , 82 million per month , use the site .
in its recent results , google revealed that profits and sales more than doubled in its third quarter .

the home grown search site rolls together many of the features and customisation tools seen on other search sites .
initially , it has launched just a prototype , but the finished version will be ready by the end of 2004 .
microsoft plans to use the search site as a springboard to take a significant share of the advertising market from rivals google and yahoo .
search wars in july this year , microsoft updated and tidied up its msn search page to remove unwanted adverts and to speed up the returning of results .
that search engine was based on technology provided by yahoo and microsoft will soon drop that in favour of its own home-grown search engine .
microsoft has been testing this own-brand search tool since july and now has launched a test version .
in a statement microsoft said its search engine returned results from five billion web pages - more than any other search engine .
but this quickly won a response from google which announced that its index has now grown to more than 8 billion pages .
prior to the microsoft announcement , google was only indexing 4,285,199,774 web pages .
as well as a large number of pages , the microsoft search engine , which operates under the msn banner , also includes a number of features that have already been seen on other search sites .
any which way results returned by the msn search engine will be arranged according to categories .
users will be able to flip between different results , such as web , news and images , by clicking on tabs .
also on hand will be menus to help refine searches according to countries or languages .
google is king of the search space microsoft will also include what it has dubbed " graphic equalisers " that let people emphasise different characteristics of results such as ones that are more popular or more recent .
the search site will also return canned results for discrete queries such as capital cities and other well known facts plus definitions , calculations , conversions and solutions to equations .
ask jeeves has been offering similar services for some time .
tony macklin , director of product at ask jeeves , said : " the level of investment required of both time and money to enter this market shows it is clearly not an easy accomplishment . "
he said many users would probably not notice the difference between the new msn search engine and the old yahoo-based one .
" we do not expect the replacement itself to turn the search market upside down , " he said .
the search market has become much more competitive in 2004 , largely because so many organisations realise that the main thing that web users do is search for information .
research carried out by ask jeeves suggests that 80 % of what people do on the web begins at a search site .
' we will surpass ' this also explains the recent interest in personal search systems that catalogue everything people have on their home computer .
firms such as blinkx , copernic , enfish , x1 and google and others have all released programs that index all the files on your pc .
microsoft has yet to launch its version of this type of software .
microsoft hopes that its msn search will take a significant share of the advertising revenue that google currently generates .
at its recent annual shareholder meeting microsoft chief executive steve ballmer said the company would take on google directly .
" we think there is a heck of a lot of great new innovation in the search space , " said mr ballmer .
" we will catch up .
we will surpass . "

the home grown search site rolls together many of the features and customisation tools seen on other search sites .
initially , it has launched just a prototype , but the finished version will be ready by the end of 2004 .
microsoft plans to use the search site as a springboard to take a significant share of the advertising market from rivals google and yahoo .
search wars in july this year , microsoft updated and tidied up its msn search page to remove unwanted adverts and to speed up the returning of results .
that search engine was based on technology provided by yahoo and microsoft will soon drop that in favour of its own home-grown search engine .
microsoft has been testing this own-brand search tool since july and now has launched a test version .
in a statement microsoft said its search engine returned results from five billion web pages - more than any other search engine .
but this quickly won a response from google which announced that its index has now grown to more than 8 billion pages .
prior to the microsoft announcement , google was only indexing 4,285,199,774 web pages .
as well as a large number of pages , the microsoft search engine , which operates under the msn banner , also includes a number of features that have already been seen on other search sites .
any which way results returned by the msn search engine will be arranged according to categories .
users will be able to flip between different results , such as web , news and images , by clicking on tabs .
also on hand will be menus to help refine searches according to countries or languages .
google is king of the search space microsoft will also include what it has dubbed " graphic equalisers " that let people emphasise different characteristics of results such as ones that are more popular or more recent .
the search site will also return canned results for discrete queries such as capital cities and other well known facts plus definitions , calculations , conversions and solutions to equations .
ask jeeves has been offering similar services for some time .
tony macklin , director of product at ask jeeves , said : " the level of investment required of both time and money to enter this market shows it is clearly not an easy accomplishment . "
he said many users would probably not notice the difference between the new msn search engine and the old yahoo-based one .
" we do not expect the replacement itself to turn the search market upside down , " he said .
the search market has become much more competitive in 2004 , largely because so many organisations realise that the main thing that web users do is search for information .
research carried out by ask jeeves suggests that 80 % of what people do on the web begins at a search site .
' we will surpass ' this also explains the recent interest in personal search systems that catalogue everything people have on their home computer .
firms such as blinkx , copernic , enfish , x1 and google and others have all released programs that index all the files on your pc .
microsoft has yet to launch its version of this type of software .
microsoft hopes that its msn search will take a significant share of the advertising revenue that google currently generates .
at its recent annual shareholder meeting microsoft chief executive steve ballmer said the company would take on google directly .
" we think there is a heck of a lot of great new innovation in the search space , " said mr ballmer .
" we will catch up .
we will surpass . "
but microsoft has a long way to go to catch google not least because so many people , 82 million per month , use the site .
in its recent results , google revealed that profits and sales more than doubled in its third quarter .

the nhs health scotland study said 59 % of the population know they should eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day - three times the 1996 figure .
a growing number of those questioned also thought they could influence their own risk of getting killer diseases like cancer and heart disease .
