to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.11.2004 germany , brazil look for common ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at brazil 's political helm for two years now : lula da silva an old accord on nuclear energy and a new partnership with un ambitions are on the agenda for german foreign minister joschka fischer 's meeting with brazilian president lula da silva on thursday . brazil and germany are sure to agree on at least one point during fischer 's stop in brasilia : both countries are eager to have a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .
lula and his government wish to increase this figure to 25 percent over the next 12 years . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boosting latin american ties german foreign minister joschka fischer flew to new york sunday at the start of an americas trip focusing on berlin 's efforts to improve ties with latin america and gain a permanent seat on the un security council .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .
it is expected to take office on monday . despite giving their approval to the team as a whole , several lawmakers said they remained concerned about kroes ' extensive past business links ; she has sat on the boards of more than 30 dutch and foreign companies . those links , which kroes has now entirely abandoned , have caused disquiet over whether she can be completely unbiased as the commissioner in charge of policing anti-trust policy and fair corporate play in the eu . two of the companies that kroes has been involved with in the past - british mobile telephone operator mmo2 and dutch shipping company royal pando nedlloyd - form part of her in-tray of looming investigations . mmo2 is under investigation by brussels over cross-border " roaming " tariffs charged by mobile operators , while royal pando is one of a number of shipping lines whose eu-permitted cartel is now under review . parliament agrees on commission earlier in the day , european union lawmakers approved the bloc 's new executive commission , ending three weeks of institutional limbo sparked by protests over comments on gays and women by an italian nominee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy it all worked out in the end : jose barroso the european parliament voted by 449 votes in favor to 149 against , with 82 abstaining in the ballot , which was originally due at the end of october but was delayed by the row .
incoming commission chief jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was originally supposed to have taken office on nov .
1 , is now expected to start work in brussels on monday , officials said . dissent over hungarian candidate after italy 's rocco buttiglione withdrew his nomination as the eu 's justice commissioner in october , the main obstacle preventing the european parliament from approving barroso 's new team appeared to have been removed .
but meps were still unhappy with a couple of other nominations including that of hungarian laszlo kovacs . although hungary 's 65-year-old former foreign minister has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , his ascent to the heady ranks of eu commissioner has been far from smooth .
kovacs was originally supposed to take up the post of energy commissioner but was deemed to be unfit for the post following his hearing at the european parliament in october . second shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for taxation and customs laszlo kovacs of hungary .
in his defense kovacs -lrb- photo -rrb- argued that he had too little time to prepare for the interview procedure as he was dealing with a domestic political crisis .
and although there was a groundswell of feeling among political groups in hungary that his candidature should be withdrawn altogether , the government stood behind its selection , and he was offered an alternative portfolio , that of customs and taxation .
tuesday was his second day of reckoning , and given his first failure , the spotlight bore down on him with added glare . " you said that your energy hearings were disappointing , to say the least , because you said you did not have the previous 24 hours to swot up on subject matter , " scottish mep john purvis said .
" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west . " in my political background , there is nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of , " kovacs told the parliament . well-received changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs of latvia , the new eu energy commissioner .
latvian andris piebalgs -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will replace euroskeptic ingrida udre , had no trouble convincing meps that he was capable of tackling the energy portfolio .
and italy 's franco frattini won the support of meps as the new commissioner for justice , freedom and security after assuring the panel he would promote tolerance and uphold the rights of minorities .
getting this far with the new commission has not been smooth sailing , and though after the hearings on wednesday some meps said they still had some concerns about kovacs , they were not enough to unseat the 25-member team . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso names modified eu commission eu leaders gathered in brussels thursday for a summit focused on economic reform , but all eyes were on incoming eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who revealed a shuffled list of commission nominees .

from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2004 eu parliament for china arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament said china 's human rights record needs improving a report out on wednesday on weapons exports from the eu casts an unpleasant light on the practices of some countries .
the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .
steady decline in ratings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in it ’ s latest survey released in august , the uk-based consumer magazine which ? gave vw bad marks , putting it in the lowest “ poor ” category , a position it has now held for two years .
mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .
steady decline in ratings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in it ’ s latest survey released in august , the uk-based consumer magazine which ? gave vw bad marks , putting it in the lowest “ poor ” category , a position it has now held for two years .
mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .
but they point to a few general trends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese carmakers are giving the germans a run for their money .
for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .
“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .
he pointed out that vw has always had a strong commitment to quality and will continue to do so despite cost cutting . getting back on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work at a daimlerchrysler plant in bremen regardless of the cause , german carmakers are looking to get back into the good graces of their buying public .
particularly in the luxury category , where new cars can cost up to € 70,000 , consumers are demanding .
thus far , german carmakers in this category , ­ like mercedes-benz and bmw , ­ have not experienced a drop in sales , but their fortunes could change . according to whyte , the ceo of mercedes benz admitted in automotive news that the company had added unproven technology to vehicles too quickly , and in the future mercedes would devote more time to testing .

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .
he will argue that daschner 's actions were " necessary and proportionate to the situation . "

" we won almost all of our tackles and it was just a question of time before we scored , " klinsmann said .
" cameroon tried to kill the tempo of the game but we never allowed them to - that is what really pleases me . " for cameroon it was a missed chance to avenge their 2-0 defeat in the 2002 world cup and a miserable return for their german coach winfried schäfer . " we let the country down with that display , " schäfer said .
" i am infuriated at our lack of discipline .
i do not want to say anything else as i need to calm down . " winni on the dole after defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head coach german winfried schaefer utters his last words as cameroon coach .
schäfer had other things on his mind other than the temperament and attitude of his players after the game , like finding a new job .
cameroon sports minister siegfried etame massoma fired the former karlsruhe handler - whose contract ran until 2006 - shortly after the final whistle for poor results and serious errors of judgment according to cameroon state radio . the sports minister was not the only one seeing red .
germany took to the pitch sporting a new scarlet strip which had been adopted after klinsmann 's team of sports psychologists recommended the " aggressive " color for the new change kit .
the new approach almost paid off on 13 minutes but bernd schneider screwed his shot wide after a great solo run from philipp lahm . with 22 minutes gone , captain michael ballack then drilled a free-kick through a poor cameroon wall and ran off celebrating his 21st goal for his country .
however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .
indeed cameroon had just one chance in the entire match with barcelona striker samuel eto 'o stinging the palms of jens lehmann with a shot mid-way through the first half . but it was germany who looked more dangerous going forward and in the 51st minute ghana-born striker gerald asamoah looked certain to score only to lose his footing at the crucial moment . kuranyi and klose wrap things up two minutes later , kuranyi missed a guilt-edged chance driving his shot wide when afforded an ocean of space .
but the breakthrough finally arrived on 71 minutes as cameroon got their offside trap all wrong and kuranyi strolled through to stroke the ball home . then it turned into the miroslav klose show as the werder bremen man rifled home in the 78th minute and added his second two minutes from time as cameroon collapsed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.11.2004 germany , brazil look for common ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at brazil 's political helm for two years now : lula da silva an old accord on nuclear energy and a new partnership with un ambitions are on the agenda for german foreign minister joschka fischer 's meeting with brazilian president lula da silva on thursday . brazil and germany are sure to agree on at least one point during fischer 's stop in brasilia : both countries are eager to have a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 .

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .
it is expected to take office on monday . despite giving their approval to the team as a whole , several lawmakers said they remained concerned about kroes ' extensive past business links ; she has sat on the boards of more than 30 dutch and foreign companies . those links , which kroes has now entirely abandoned , have caused disquiet over whether she can be completely unbiased as the commissioner in charge of policing anti-trust policy and fair corporate play in the eu . two of the companies that kroes has been involved with in the past - british mobile telephone operator mmo2 and dutch shipping company royal pando nedlloyd - form part of her in-tray of looming investigations . mmo2 is under investigation by brussels over cross-border " roaming " tariffs charged by mobile operators , while royal pando is one of a number of shipping lines whose eu-permitted cartel is now under review . parliament agrees on commission earlier in the day , european union lawmakers approved the bloc 's new executive commission , ending three weeks of institutional limbo sparked by protests over comments on gays and women by an italian nominee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy it all worked out in the end : jose barroso the european parliament voted by 449 votes in favor to 149 against , with 82 abstaining in the ballot , which was originally due at the end of october but was delayed by the row .
incoming commission chief jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was originally supposed to have taken office on nov .
1 , is now expected to start work in brussels on monday , officials said . dissent over hungarian candidate after italy 's rocco buttiglione withdrew his nomination as the eu 's justice commissioner in october , the main obstacle preventing the european parliament from approving barroso 's new team appeared to have been removed .
but meps were still unhappy with a couple of other nominations including that of hungarian laszlo kovacs . although hungary 's 65-year-old former foreign minister has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , his ascent to the heady ranks of eu commissioner has been far from smooth .
kovacs was originally supposed to take up the post of energy commissioner but was deemed to be unfit for the post following his hearing at the european parliament in october . second shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for taxation and customs laszlo kovacs of hungary .
in his defense kovacs -lrb- photo -rrb- argued that he had too little time to prepare for the interview procedure as he was dealing with a domestic political crisis .
and although there was a groundswell of feeling among political groups in hungary that his candidature should be withdrawn altogether , the government stood behind its selection , and he was offered an alternative portfolio , that of customs and taxation .
tuesday was his second day of reckoning , and given his first failure , the spotlight bore down on him with added glare . " you said that your energy hearings were disappointing , to say the least , because you said you did not have the previous 24 hours to swot up on subject matter , " scottish mep john purvis said .
" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west . " in my political background , there is nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of , " kovacs told the parliament . well-received changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs of latvia , the new eu energy commissioner .
latvian andris piebalgs -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will replace euroskeptic ingrida udre , had no trouble convincing meps that he was capable of tackling the energy portfolio .
and italy 's franco frattini won the support of meps as the new commissioner for justice , freedom and security after assuring the panel he would promote tolerance and uphold the rights of minorities .
getting this far with the new commission has not been smooth sailing , and though after the hearings on wednesday some meps said they still had some concerns about kovacs , they were not enough to unseat the 25-member team . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso names modified eu commission eu leaders gathered in brussels thursday for a summit focused on economic reform , but all eyes were on incoming eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who revealed a shuffled list of commission nominees .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .
it is expected to take office on monday . despite giving their approval to the team as a whole , several lawmakers said they remained concerned about kroes ' extensive past business links ; she has sat on the boards of more than 30 dutch and foreign companies . those links , which kroes has now entirely abandoned , have caused disquiet over whether she can be completely unbiased as the commissioner in charge of policing anti-trust policy and fair corporate play in the eu . two of the companies that kroes has been involved with in the past - british mobile telephone operator mmo2 and dutch shipping company royal pando nedlloyd - form part of her in-tray of looming investigations . mmo2 is under investigation by brussels over cross-border " roaming " tariffs charged by mobile operators , while royal pando is one of a number of shipping lines whose eu-permitted cartel is now under review . parliament agrees on commission earlier in the day , european union lawmakers approved the bloc 's new executive commission , ending three weeks of institutional limbo sparked by protests over comments on gays and women by an italian nominee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy it all worked out in the end : jose barroso the european parliament voted by 449 votes in favor to 149 against , with 82 abstaining in the ballot , which was originally due at the end of october but was delayed by the row .
incoming commission chief jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was originally supposed to have taken office on nov .
1 , is now expected to start work in brussels on monday , officials said . dissent over hungarian candidate after italy 's rocco buttiglione withdrew his nomination as the eu 's justice commissioner in october , the main obstacle preventing the european parliament from approving barroso 's new team appeared to have been removed .
but meps were still unhappy with a couple of other nominations including that of hungarian laszlo kovacs . although hungary 's 65-year-old former foreign minister has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , his ascent to the heady ranks of eu commissioner has been far from smooth .
kovacs was originally supposed to take up the post of energy commissioner but was deemed to be unfit for the post following his hearing at the european parliament in october . second shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for taxation and customs laszlo kovacs of hungary .
in his defense kovacs -lrb- photo -rrb- argued that he had too little time to prepare for the interview procedure as he was dealing with a domestic political crisis .
and although there was a groundswell of feeling among political groups in hungary that his candidature should be withdrawn altogether , the government stood behind its selection , and he was offered an alternative portfolio , that of customs and taxation .
tuesday was his second day of reckoning , and given his first failure , the spotlight bore down on him with added glare . " you said that your energy hearings were disappointing , to say the least , because you said you did not have the previous 24 hours to swot up on subject matter , " scottish mep john purvis said .
" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west . " in my political background , there is nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of , " kovacs told the parliament . well-received changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs of latvia , the new eu energy commissioner .
latvian andris piebalgs -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will replace euroskeptic ingrida udre , had no trouble convincing meps that he was capable of tackling the energy portfolio .
and italy 's franco frattini won the support of meps as the new commissioner for justice , freedom and security after assuring the panel he would promote tolerance and uphold the rights of minorities .
getting this far with the new commission has not been smooth sailing , and though after the hearings on wednesday some meps said they still had some concerns about kovacs , they were not enough to unseat the 25-member team . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso names modified eu commission eu leaders gathered in brussels thursday for a summit focused on economic reform , but all eyes were on incoming eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who revealed a shuffled list of commission nominees .

from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2004 eu parliament for china arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament said china 's human rights record needs improving a report out on wednesday on weapons exports from the eu casts an unpleasant light on the practices of some countries .
the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

they were later broadcast to germany by the german service of the bbc . later evidence quoted by historians revealed that an enraged hitler wanted galen hanged , but that propaganda minister joseph goebbels warned this could lead to alienation among sections of the local catholic population among whom galen was highly popular .
hitler was then reported to have said he would " settle the score " with galen after the war . cardinal position awarded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clemens august , count von galen , in an undated photograph .

he was born in 1878 , the child of aristocrats , ordained as a catholic priest in 1904 , and became head of the münster diocese in 1933 , the year the nazis came to power .
shortly before his death in 1946 the then pope elevated him to the rank of cardinal . the vatican began the beatification process at the end of last year by formally recognizing galen 's " heroic virtues , " one of the first steps in the procedure of beatification . afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .

audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .

it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .
“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .

in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .

"
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .
he will argue that daschner 's actions were " necessary and proportionate to the situation . "
the question , he has said , is whether the police must sit and wait while " a kidnapped child dies an agonizing death . " a verdict could be handed down before the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt deputy police chief charged in torture case prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son .

however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2004 new commissioner faces first test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's new eu team passed , but not without complications just hours after the european parliament gave the new commission the green light to get to work , it was revealed that competition commissioner neelie kroes would have to initially step back due to conflicts of interest . the european union 's controversial new competition commissioner will have to stand aside from three investigations immediately after taking office because of conflicts of interest , an official said thursday . under guidelines agreed with incoming european commission president jose barroso , the netherlands ' neelie kroes will not be able to oversee the three cases when the new eu executive takes office next week . " the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .
it is expected to take office on monday . despite giving their approval to the team as a whole , several lawmakers said they remained concerned about kroes ' extensive past business links ; she has sat on the boards of more than 30 dutch and foreign companies . those links , which kroes has now entirely abandoned , have caused disquiet over whether she can be completely unbiased as the commissioner in charge of policing anti-trust policy and fair corporate play in the eu . two of the companies that kroes has been involved with in the past - british mobile telephone operator mmo2 and dutch shipping company royal pando nedlloyd - form part of her in-tray of looming investigations . mmo2 is under investigation by brussels over cross-border " roaming " tariffs charged by mobile operators , while royal pando is one of a number of shipping lines whose eu-permitted cartel is now under review . parliament agrees on commission earlier in the day , european union lawmakers approved the bloc 's new executive commission , ending three weeks of institutional limbo sparked by protests over comments on gays and women by an italian nominee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy it all worked out in the end : jose barroso the european parliament voted by 449 votes in favor to 149 against , with 82 abstaining in the ballot , which was originally due at the end of october but was delayed by the row .
incoming commission chief jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was originally supposed to have taken office on nov .
1 , is now expected to start work in brussels on monday , officials said . dissent over hungarian candidate after italy 's rocco buttiglione withdrew his nomination as the eu 's justice commissioner in october , the main obstacle preventing the european parliament from approving barroso 's new team appeared to have been removed .
but meps were still unhappy with a couple of other nominations including that of hungarian laszlo kovacs . although hungary 's 65-year-old former foreign minister has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , his ascent to the heady ranks of eu commissioner has been far from smooth .
kovacs was originally supposed to take up the post of energy commissioner but was deemed to be unfit for the post following his hearing at the european parliament in october . second shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for taxation and customs laszlo kovacs of hungary .
in his defense kovacs -lrb- photo -rrb- argued that he had too little time to prepare for the interview procedure as he was dealing with a domestic political crisis .
and although there was a groundswell of feeling among political groups in hungary that his candidature should be withdrawn altogether , the government stood behind its selection , and he was offered an alternative portfolio , that of customs and taxation .
tuesday was his second day of reckoning , and given his first failure , the spotlight bore down on him with added glare . " you said that your energy hearings were disappointing , to say the least , because you said you did not have the previous 24 hours to swot up on subject matter , " scottish mep john purvis said .
" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west . " in my political background , there is nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of , " kovacs told the parliament . well-received changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs of latvia , the new eu energy commissioner .
latvian andris piebalgs -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will replace euroskeptic ingrida udre , had no trouble convincing meps that he was capable of tackling the energy portfolio .
and italy 's franco frattini won the support of meps as the new commissioner for justice , freedom and security after assuring the panel he would promote tolerance and uphold the rights of minorities .
getting this far with the new commission has not been smooth sailing , and though after the hearings on wednesday some meps said they still had some concerns about kovacs , they were not enough to unseat the 25-member team . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso names modified eu commission eu leaders gathered in brussels thursday for a summit focused on economic reform , but all eyes were on incoming eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who revealed a shuffled list of commission nominees .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .
it is expected to take office on monday . despite giving their approval to the team as a whole , several lawmakers said they remained concerned about kroes ' extensive past business links ; she has sat on the boards of more than 30 dutch and foreign companies . those links , which kroes has now entirely abandoned , have caused disquiet over whether she can be completely unbiased as the commissioner in charge of policing anti-trust policy and fair corporate play in the eu . two of the companies that kroes has been involved with in the past - british mobile telephone operator mmo2 and dutch shipping company royal pando nedlloyd - form part of her in-tray of looming investigations . mmo2 is under investigation by brussels over cross-border " roaming " tariffs charged by mobile operators , while royal pando is one of a number of shipping lines whose eu-permitted cartel is now under review . parliament agrees on commission earlier in the day , european union lawmakers approved the bloc 's new executive commission , ending three weeks of institutional limbo sparked by protests over comments on gays and women by an italian nominee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy it all worked out in the end : jose barroso the european parliament voted by 449 votes in favor to 149 against , with 82 abstaining in the ballot , which was originally due at the end of october but was delayed by the row .
incoming commission chief jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was originally supposed to have taken office on nov .
1 , is now expected to start work in brussels on monday , officials said . dissent over hungarian candidate after italy 's rocco buttiglione withdrew his nomination as the eu 's justice commissioner in october , the main obstacle preventing the european parliament from approving barroso 's new team appeared to have been removed .
but meps were still unhappy with a couple of other nominations including that of hungarian laszlo kovacs . although hungary 's 65-year-old former foreign minister has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , his ascent to the heady ranks of eu commissioner has been far from smooth .
kovacs was originally supposed to take up the post of energy commissioner but was deemed to be unfit for the post following his hearing at the european parliament in october . second shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for taxation and customs laszlo kovacs of hungary .
in his defense kovacs -lrb- photo -rrb- argued that he had too little time to prepare for the interview procedure as he was dealing with a domestic political crisis .
and although there was a groundswell of feeling among political groups in hungary that his candidature should be withdrawn altogether , the government stood behind its selection , and he was offered an alternative portfolio , that of customs and taxation .
tuesday was his second day of reckoning , and given his first failure , the spotlight bore down on him with added glare . " you said that your energy hearings were disappointing , to say the least , because you said you did not have the previous 24 hours to swot up on subject matter , " scottish mep john purvis said .
" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west . " in my political background , there is nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of , " kovacs told the parliament . well-received changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs of latvia , the new eu energy commissioner .
latvian andris piebalgs -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will replace euroskeptic ingrida udre , had no trouble convincing meps that he was capable of tackling the energy portfolio .
and italy 's franco frattini won the support of meps as the new commissioner for justice , freedom and security after assuring the panel he would promote tolerance and uphold the rights of minorities .
getting this far with the new commission has not been smooth sailing , and though after the hearings on wednesday some meps said they still had some concerns about kovacs , they were not enough to unseat the 25-member team . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso names modified eu commission eu leaders gathered in brussels thursday for a summit focused on economic reform , but all eyes were on incoming eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who revealed a shuffled list of commission nominees .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .
someone should be looking into the weird goings-on in the university city a few hundred kilometers north of bielefeld . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

" we won almost all of our tackles and it was just a question of time before we scored , " klinsmann said .
" cameroon tried to kill the tempo of the game but we never allowed them to - that is what really pleases me . " for cameroon it was a missed chance to avenge their 2-0 defeat in the 2002 world cup and a miserable return for their german coach winfried schäfer . " we let the country down with that display , " schäfer said .
" i am infuriated at our lack of discipline .
i do not want to say anything else as i need to calm down . " winni on the dole after defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head coach german winfried schaefer utters his last words as cameroon coach .
schäfer had other things on his mind other than the temperament and attitude of his players after the game , like finding a new job .
cameroon sports minister siegfried etame massoma fired the former karlsruhe handler - whose contract ran until 2006 - shortly after the final whistle for poor results and serious errors of judgment according to cameroon state radio . the sports minister was not the only one seeing red .
germany took to the pitch sporting a new scarlet strip which had been adopted after klinsmann 's team of sports psychologists recommended the " aggressive " color for the new change kit .
the new approach almost paid off on 13 minutes but bernd schneider screwed his shot wide after a great solo run from philipp lahm . with 22 minutes gone , captain michael ballack then drilled a free-kick through a poor cameroon wall and ran off celebrating his 21st goal for his country .
however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .
indeed cameroon had just one chance in the entire match with barcelona striker samuel eto 'o stinging the palms of jens lehmann with a shot mid-way through the first half . but it was germany who looked more dangerous going forward and in the 51st minute ghana-born striker gerald asamoah looked certain to score only to lose his footing at the crucial moment . kuranyi and klose wrap things up two minutes later , kuranyi missed a guilt-edged chance driving his shot wide when afforded an ocean of space .
but the breakthrough finally arrived on 71 minutes as cameroon got their offside trap all wrong and kuranyi strolled through to stroke the ball home . then it turned into the miroslav klose show as the werder bremen man rifled home in the 78th minute and added his second two minutes from time as cameroon collapsed .

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .
he will argue that daschner 's actions were " necessary and proportionate to the situation . "
the question , he has said , is whether the police must sit and wait while " a kidnapped child dies an agonizing death . " a verdict could be handed down before the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt deputy police chief charged in torture case prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son .

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .
he will argue that daschner 's actions were " necessary and proportionate to the situation . "

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .
steady decline in ratings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in it ’ s latest survey released in august , the uk-based consumer magazine which ? gave vw bad marks , putting it in the lowest “ poor ” category , a position it has now held for two years .
mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .
but they point to a few general trends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese carmakers are giving the germans a run for their money .
for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .
“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .
steady decline in ratings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in it ’ s latest survey released in august , the uk-based consumer magazine which ? gave vw bad marks , putting it in the lowest “ poor ” category , a position it has now held for two years .
mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .
but they point to a few general trends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese carmakers are giving the germans a run for their money .
for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .
“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .
steady decline in ratings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in it ’ s latest survey released in august , the uk-based consumer magazine which ? gave vw bad marks , putting it in the lowest “ poor ” category , a position it has now held for two years .
mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .
but they point to a few general trends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese carmakers are giving the germans a run for their money .
for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .
“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .
he pointed out that vw has always had a strong commitment to quality and will continue to do so despite cost cutting . getting back on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work at a daimlerchrysler plant in bremen regardless of the cause , german carmakers are looking to get back into the good graces of their buying public .
particularly in the luxury category , where new cars can cost up to € 70,000 , consumers are demanding .
thus far , german carmakers in this category , ­ like mercedes-benz and bmw , ­ have not experienced a drop in sales , but their fortunes could change . according to whyte , the ceo of mercedes benz admitted in automotive news that the company had added unproven technology to vehicles too quickly , and in the future mercedes would devote more time to testing .
if that ’ s the case , it will still take a few years for the turn-around to turn up in surveys . at vw , management will have to get to the root of the problem , in the hopes of living up to their old slogan : “ if only everything in life was as reliable as a volkswagen . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?
the threats issued from the boardrooms of the global car giants are clear : bring down the cost of production or jobs will be cut .
in july , daimler-chrysler told its stuttgart workers that either wages will be cut or production of the c-class mercedes will move to south africa .

12 , 2004 -rrb- german carmakers face a bumpy ride in this dossier , dw-world takes a look at the ups and downs of the german car industry in the last year and examines the issues of outsourcing , labor market reforms and job cuts as they relate to the future of one of the country 's largest manufacturing sectors .

" we won almost all of our tackles and it was just a question of time before we scored , " klinsmann said .
" cameroon tried to kill the tempo of the game but we never allowed them to - that is what really pleases me . " for cameroon it was a missed chance to avenge their 2-0 defeat in the 2002 world cup and a miserable return for their german coach winfried schäfer .

i do not want to say anything else as i need to calm down . " winni on the dole after defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head coach german winfried schaefer utters his last words as cameroon coach .
schäfer had other things on his mind other than the temperament and attitude of his players after the game , like finding a new job .
cameroon sports minister siegfried etame massoma fired the former karlsruhe handler - whose contract ran until 2006 - shortly after the final whistle for poor results and serious errors of judgment according to cameroon state radio . the sports minister was not the only one seeing red .
germany took to the pitch sporting a new scarlet strip which had been adopted after klinsmann 's team of sports psychologists recommended the " aggressive " color for the new change kit .
the new approach almost paid off on 13 minutes but bernd schneider screwed his shot wide after a great solo run from philipp lahm . with 22 minutes gone , captain michael ballack then drilled a free-kick through a poor cameroon wall and ran off celebrating his 21st goal for his country .
however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .
indeed cameroon had just one chance in the entire match with barcelona striker samuel eto 'o stinging the palms of jens lehmann with a shot mid-way through the first half . but it was germany who looked more dangerous going forward and in the 51st minute ghana-born striker gerald asamoah looked certain to score only to lose his footing at the crucial moment . kuranyi and klose wrap things up two minutes later , kuranyi missed a guilt-edged chance driving his shot wide when afforded an ocean of space .
but the breakthrough finally arrived on 71 minutes as cameroon got their offside trap all wrong and kuranyi strolled through to stroke the ball home . then it turned into the miroslav klose show as the werder bremen man rifled home in the 78th minute and added his second two minutes from time as cameroon collapsed .

schäfer had other things on his mind other than the temperament and attitude of his players after the game , like finding a new job .
cameroon sports minister siegfried etame massoma fired the former karlsruhe handler - whose contract ran until 2006 - shortly after the final whistle for poor results and serious errors of judgment according to cameroon state radio . the sports minister was not the only one seeing red .
germany took to the pitch sporting a new scarlet strip which had been adopted after klinsmann 's team of sports psychologists recommended the " aggressive " color for the new change kit .
the new approach almost paid off on 13 minutes but bernd schneider screwed his shot wide after a great solo run from philipp lahm . with 22 minutes gone , captain michael ballack then drilled a free-kick through a poor cameroon wall and ran off celebrating his 21st goal for his country .
however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .
indeed cameroon had just one chance in the entire match with barcelona striker samuel eto 'o stinging the palms of jens lehmann with a shot mid-way through the first half . but it was germany who looked more dangerous going forward and in the 51st minute ghana-born striker gerald asamoah looked certain to score only to lose his footing at the crucial moment . kuranyi and klose wrap things up two minutes later , kuranyi missed a guilt-edged chance driving his shot wide when afforded an ocean of space .
but the breakthrough finally arrived on 71 minutes as cameroon got their offside trap all wrong and kuranyi strolled through to stroke the ball home . then it turned into the miroslav klose show as the werder bremen man rifled home in the 78th minute and added his second two minutes from time as cameroon collapsed .

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2004 eu parliament for china arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament said china 's human rights record needs improving a report out on wednesday on weapons exports from the eu casts an unpleasant light on the practices of some countries .
the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.11.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc spain to advise poland on spending eu money spain has announced that it wants to advise poland on the use of eu money for infrastructure projects .
spanish infrastructure minister magdalena alvarez said that her country could become a " model " for new member states , according to german daily handelsblatt .
spain receives large amounts of money from the eu for infrastructure - last year and the year before it received a net sum of € 8 billion -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- , more than any other member state .
however , the funds are not bottomless and with the entry of 10 , generally poor , new member states into the eu last may , spain 's happy turn with the money is slowly running out .
alvarez 's gesture comes via pressure from the spanish construction industry , according to handelsblatt .
with structural funds flowing to the member states in central and east europe , spanish industry wants to conquer new markets .
spanish construction firms have strongly profited from brussels money .
" through its large profits it -lsb- the industry -rsb- now accounts for three quarters of growth .
without eu subsidies , things would be quite gloomy , " said manuel romera , a real estate expert , quoted by the newspaper .
for its part the spanish government wants a long phasing out of the structural funds - in 2015 , and not in 2007 as is planned .
in the multi-annual eu budget talks , which sets the budget for 2007-2013 , spain is pushing for the budget ceiling to be set at 1.24 percent of gdp - which could allow such a long phasing out .
however , germany , which pays the most into eu coffers , wants the ceiling set at 1 percent of gdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.11.2004 germany 's latest conspiracy theory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sparrenburg castle : bielefeld 's landmark or a top secret laboratory ?
it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.11.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc struck favors tank sales to turkey german defense minister peter struck on thursday said he favors the sale of german leopard ii tanks to turkey , just five years after his country rejected a similar request by ankara on grounds that the weapons could be used against civilians in eastern turkey .
" if turkey makes a request -lrb- to purchase the tanks -rrb- , as minister of defense , i would give a favorable opinion to the -lrb- german -rrb- chancellor and the foreign minister , " struck said .
in ankara , he told a joint press conference with his turkish counterpart vecdi gonul that turkey , a nato member and a candidate for membership in the european union , had undergone major changes since the initial german refusal .

" it 's a brutal development , as -lrb- european central bank chief -rrb- jean-claude trichet has said , " eichel said in an interview with german ard public television on thursday , as the euro hit a new all-time high of $ 1.3073 .
" it will have to be talked about .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .
it is expected to take office on monday . despite giving their approval to the team as a whole , several lawmakers said they remained concerned about kroes ' extensive past business links ; she has sat on the boards of more than 30 dutch and foreign companies . those links , which kroes has now entirely abandoned , have caused disquiet over whether she can be completely unbiased as the commissioner in charge of policing anti-trust policy and fair corporate play in the eu . two of the companies that kroes has been involved with in the past - british mobile telephone operator mmo2 and dutch shipping company royal pando nedlloyd - form part of her in-tray of looming investigations . mmo2 is under investigation by brussels over cross-border " roaming " tariffs charged by mobile operators , while royal pando is one of a number of shipping lines whose eu-permitted cartel is now under review . parliament agrees on commission earlier in the day , european union lawmakers approved the bloc 's new executive commission , ending three weeks of institutional limbo sparked by protests over comments on gays and women by an italian nominee .

" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.11.2004 german business looks to future in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the bright star in the asia-pacific economy this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions . the asia-pacific region is by far the biggest growth area worldwide .
from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- visited a berlin siemens plant with von pierer in may .
but heinrich von pierer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who sees china as key to the health of the region , was confident that the region 's biggest economy is not heading for a " hard landing . "
" i think you can read a lot of things , but if you talk to the chinese leaders , you get much more confident ...
i 'm confident that the chinese will be very successful , " he said . thomas kohlmann -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the chinese connection dw-world has put together a collection of articles cataloguing the industrial , political and cultural exchanges between germany and china since 2002 .

taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .

in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .

the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .
lula and his government wish to increase this figure to 25 percent over the next 12 years . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boosting latin american ties german foreign minister joschka fischer flew to new york sunday at the start of an americas trip focusing on berlin 's efforts to improve ties with latin america and gain a permanent seat on the un security council .

chirac said that he and british premier tony blair had quarrelled only once , over agricultural policy , and that there had never been a dispute over iraq .
and he said , " there is no difference between the british and the french visions of europe … we have always had our differences and we have always continued hand-in-hand . "
furthermore , he believes that the british people will vote " yes " in a forthcoming referendum on the european constitution because , " in the end , good sense will triumph over ill temper . "
but although chirac with those words sought to emphasize the closeness of the two countries - he earlier in the week was critical of blair 's relationship with us president george w. bush .
" britain gave its support but i did not see anything in return , " chirac said , referring to britain 'support for the us-led war in iraq - a war which france strongly opposed .
a spokesman for the british government acknowledged there had been differences over iraq , but said that people should be " grown up " about it .
" this doesn ’ t mean the two leaders can not work together . "
chirac is visiting blair as part of the celebrations surrounding the centenary of the entente cordiale between the two countries .

spanish infrastructure minister magdalena alvarez said that her country could become a " model " for new member states , according to german daily handelsblatt .
spain receives large amounts of money from the eu for infrastructure - last year and the year before it received a net sum of € 8 billion -lrb- $ 10.4 billion -rrb- , more than any other member state .
however , the funds are not bottomless and with the entry of 10 , generally poor , new member states into the eu last may , spain 's happy turn with the money is slowly running out .
alvarez 's gesture comes via pressure from the spanish construction industry , according to handelsblatt .
with structural funds flowing to the member states in central and east europe , spanish industry wants to conquer new markets .
spanish construction firms have strongly profited from brussels money .
" through its large profits it -lsb- the industry -rsb- now accounts for three quarters of growth .
without eu subsidies , things would be quite gloomy , " said manuel romera , a real estate expert , quoted by the newspaper .
for its part the spanish government wants a long phasing out of the structural funds - in 2015 , and not in 2007 as is planned .
in the multi-annual eu budget talks , which sets the budget for 2007-2013 , spain is pushing for the budget ceiling to be set at 1.24 percent of gdp - which could allow such a long phasing out .
however , germany , which pays the most into eu coffers , wants the ceiling set at 1 percent of gdp .

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .

while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .

a glass bottle filled with flammable liquid was tossed against the sinsheim mosque 's entryway around 12:30 a.m.

" we won almost all of our tackles and it was just a question of time before we scored , " klinsmann said .

however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .

" we won almost all of our tackles and it was just a question of time before we scored , " klinsmann said .
" cameroon tried to kill the tempo of the game but we never allowed them to - that is what really pleases me . " for cameroon it was a missed chance to avenge their 2-0 defeat in the 2002 world cup and a miserable return for their german coach winfried schäfer . " we let the country down with that display , " schäfer said .
" i am infuriated at our lack of discipline .
i do not want to say anything else as i need to calm down . " winni on the dole after defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head coach german winfried schaefer utters his last words as cameroon coach .
schäfer had other things on his mind other than the temperament and attitude of his players after the game , like finding a new job .
cameroon sports minister siegfried etame massoma fired the former karlsruhe handler - whose contract ran until 2006 - shortly after the final whistle for poor results and serious errors of judgment according to cameroon state radio . the sports minister was not the only one seeing red .
germany took to the pitch sporting a new scarlet strip which had been adopted after klinsmann 's team of sports psychologists recommended the " aggressive " color for the new change kit .
the new approach almost paid off on 13 minutes but bernd schneider screwed his shot wide after a great solo run from philipp lahm . with 22 minutes gone , captain michael ballack then drilled a free-kick through a poor cameroon wall and ran off celebrating his 21st goal for his country .
however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .
indeed cameroon had just one chance in the entire match with barcelona striker samuel eto 'o stinging the palms of jens lehmann with a shot mid-way through the first half . but it was germany who looked more dangerous going forward and in the 51st minute ghana-born striker gerald asamoah looked certain to score only to lose his footing at the crucial moment . kuranyi and klose wrap things up two minutes later , kuranyi missed a guilt-edged chance driving his shot wide when afforded an ocean of space .
but the breakthrough finally arrived on 71 minutes as cameroon got their offside trap all wrong and kuranyi strolled through to stroke the ball home . then it turned into the miroslav klose show as the werder bremen man rifled home in the 78th minute and added his second two minutes from time as cameroon collapsed . " it is always nice to come on when the opposition are tired , " klose said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a mascot for all seasons ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.11.2004 german business looks to future in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the bright star in the asia-pacific economy this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions . the asia-pacific region is by far the biggest growth area worldwide .
from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao -lrb- left -rrb- visited a berlin siemens plant with von pierer in may .
but heinrich von pierer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who sees china as key to the health of the region , was confident that the region 's biggest economy is not heading for a " hard landing . "
" i think you can read a lot of things , but if you talk to the chinese leaders , you get much more confident ...
i 'm confident that the chinese will be very successful , " he said . thomas kohlmann -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the chinese connection dw-world has put together a collection of articles cataloguing the industrial , political and cultural exchanges between germany and china since 2002 .

beatification is the first step toward canonization , or bestowing sainthood upon a person .
recent people beatified by the pope include mother teresa and the last austrian emperor , charles i. sermons smuggled abroad when clemens august preached against the nazis euthanasia program , worshippers had secretly noted down his sermons , and the anti-nazi resistance smuggled them abroad .
they were later broadcast to germany by the german service of the bbc . later evidence quoted by historians revealed that an enraged hitler wanted galen hanged , but that propaganda minister joseph goebbels warned this could lead to alienation among sections of the local catholic population among whom galen was highly popular .
hitler was then reported to have said he would " settle the score " with galen after the war . cardinal position awarded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clemens august , count von galen , in an undated photograph .
" the lion of münster , " as he came to be known , survived the war but only briefly .
he was born in 1878 , the child of aristocrats , ordained as a catholic priest in 1904 , and became head of the münster diocese in 1933 , the year the nazis came to power .
shortly before his death in 1946 the then pope elevated him to the rank of cardinal . the vatican began the beatification process at the end of last year by formally recognizing galen 's " heroic virtues , " one of the first steps in the procedure of beatification . afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

who deserves to be a saint ?
the question is a source of great debate among catholics .
on sunday , charles i of austria will be beatified at the vatican , while an angry dispute erupts over his historic role at home .

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .
lula and his government wish to increase this figure to 25 percent over the next 12 years . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boosting latin american ties german foreign minister joschka fischer flew to new york sunday at the start of an americas trip focusing on berlin 's efforts to improve ties with latin america and gain a permanent seat on the un security council .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .
steady decline in ratings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in it ’ s latest survey released in august , the uk-based consumer magazine which ? gave vw bad marks , putting it in the lowest “ poor ” category , a position it has now held for two years .
mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .
but they point to a few general trends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese carmakers are giving the germans a run for their money .
for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .
“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .
he pointed out that vw has always had a strong commitment to quality and will continue to do so despite cost cutting . getting back on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work at a daimlerchrysler plant in bremen regardless of the cause , german carmakers are looking to get back into the good graces of their buying public .
particularly in the luxury category , where new cars can cost up to € 70,000 , consumers are demanding .
thus far , german carmakers in this category , ­ like mercedes-benz and bmw , ­ have not experienced a drop in sales , but their fortunes could change . according to whyte , the ceo of mercedes benz admitted in automotive news that the company had added unproven technology to vehicles too quickly , and in the future mercedes would devote more time to testing .
if that ’ s the case , it will still take a few years for the turn-around to turn up in surveys . at vw , management will have to get to the root of the problem , in the hopes of living up to their old slogan : “ if only everything in life was as reliable as a volkswagen . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?
the threats issued from the boardrooms of the global car giants are clear : bring down the cost of production or jobs will be cut .
in july , daimler-chrysler told its stuttgart workers that either wages will be cut or production of the c-class mercedes will move to south africa .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .

the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "

in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .
someone should be looking into the weird goings-on in the university city a few hundred kilometers north of bielefeld . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .

meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.11.2004 german business looks to future in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the bright star in the asia-pacific economy this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions . the asia-pacific region is by far the biggest growth area worldwide .
from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .

" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

beatification is the first step toward canonization , or bestowing sainthood upon a person .
recent people beatified by the pope include mother teresa and the last austrian emperor , charles i. sermons smuggled abroad when clemens august preached against the nazis euthanasia program , worshippers had secretly noted down his sermons , and the anti-nazi resistance smuggled them abroad .
they were later broadcast to germany by the german service of the bbc . later evidence quoted by historians revealed that an enraged hitler wanted galen hanged , but that propaganda minister joseph goebbels warned this could lead to alienation among sections of the local catholic population among whom galen was highly popular .
hitler was then reported to have said he would " settle the score " with galen after the war . cardinal position awarded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clemens august , count von galen , in an undated photograph .

he was born in 1878 , the child of aristocrats , ordained as a catholic priest in 1904 , and became head of the münster diocese in 1933 , the year the nazis came to power .
shortly before his death in 1946 the then pope elevated him to the rank of cardinal . the vatican began the beatification process at the end of last year by formally recognizing galen 's " heroic virtues , " one of the first steps in the procedure of beatification . afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.11.2004 german business looks to future in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the bright star in the asia-pacific economy this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions . the asia-pacific region is by far the biggest growth area worldwide .
from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

but heinrich von pierer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who sees china as key to the health of the region , was confident that the region 's biggest economy is not heading for a " hard landing . "
" i think you can read a lot of things , but if you talk to the chinese leaders , you get much more confident ...

from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

but heinrich von pierer -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , who sees china as key to the health of the region , was confident that the region 's biggest economy is not heading for a " hard landing . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2004 ex-police chief defends torture threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daschner says his superiors told him to threaten a suspect a former frankfurt deputy police chief took the stand on thursday to answer charges he threatened a suspect with torture .
the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .
he will argue that daschner 's actions were " necessary and proportionate to the situation . "
the question , he has said , is whether the police must sit and wait while " a kidnapped child dies an agonizing death . " a verdict could be handed down before the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt deputy police chief charged in torture case prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .

while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .

mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .
but they point to a few general trends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese carmakers are giving the germans a run for their money .
for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .

“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .

particularly in the luxury category , where new cars can cost up to € 70,000 , consumers are demanding .
thus far , german carmakers in this category , ­ like mercedes-benz and bmw , ­ have not experienced a drop in sales , but their fortunes could change . according to whyte , the ceo of mercedes benz admitted in automotive news that the company had added unproven technology to vehicles too quickly , and in the future mercedes would devote more time to testing .
if that ’ s the case , it will still take a few years for the turn-around to turn up in surveys . at vw , management will have to get to the root of the problem , in the hopes of living up to their old slogan : “ if only everything in life was as reliable as a volkswagen . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

thus far , german carmakers in this category , ­ like mercedes-benz and bmw , ­ have not experienced a drop in sales , but their fortunes could change . according to whyte , the ceo of mercedes benz admitted in automotive news that the company had added unproven technology to vehicles too quickly , and in the future mercedes would devote more time to testing .
if that ’ s the case , it will still take a few years for the turn-around to turn up in surveys . at vw , management will have to get to the root of the problem , in the hopes of living up to their old slogan : “ if only everything in life was as reliable as a volkswagen . ” kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2004 eu parliament for china arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament said china 's human rights record needs improving a report out on wednesday on weapons exports from the eu casts an unpleasant light on the practices of some countries .
the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .

beatification is the first step toward canonization , or bestowing sainthood upon a person .
recent people beatified by the pope include mother teresa and the last austrian emperor , charles i. sermons smuggled abroad when clemens august preached against the nazis euthanasia program , worshippers had secretly noted down his sermons , and the anti-nazi resistance smuggled them abroad .
they were later broadcast to germany by the german service of the bbc . later evidence quoted by historians revealed that an enraged hitler wanted galen hanged , but that propaganda minister joseph goebbels warned this could lead to alienation among sections of the local catholic population among whom galen was highly popular .
hitler was then reported to have said he would " settle the score " with galen after the war . cardinal position awarded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clemens august , count von galen , in an undated photograph .
" the lion of münster , " as he came to be known , survived the war but only briefly .
he was born in 1878 , the child of aristocrats , ordained as a catholic priest in 1904 , and became head of the münster diocese in 1933 , the year the nazis came to power .
shortly before his death in 1946 the then pope elevated him to the rank of cardinal . the vatican began the beatification process at the end of last year by formally recognizing galen 's " heroic virtues , " one of the first steps in the procedure of beatification . afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.11.2004 germany , brazil look for common ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at brazil 's political helm for two years now : lula da silva an old accord on nuclear energy and a new partnership with un ambitions are on the agenda for german foreign minister joschka fischer 's meeting with brazilian president lula da silva on thursday . brazil and germany are sure to agree on at least one point during fischer 's stop in brasilia : both countries are eager to have a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .

meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .

on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .

in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .

according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .

the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !

" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .

in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .

"
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture .

they were later broadcast to germany by the german service of the bbc . later evidence quoted by historians revealed that an enraged hitler wanted galen hanged , but that propaganda minister joseph goebbels warned this could lead to alienation among sections of the local catholic population among whom galen was highly popular .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2004 eu parliament for china arms embargo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the parliament said china 's human rights record needs improving a report out on wednesday on weapons exports from the eu casts an unpleasant light on the practices of some countries .
the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .

" china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .

but meps were still unhappy with a couple of other nominations including that of hungarian laszlo kovacs . although hungary 's 65-year-old former foreign minister has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , his ascent to the heady ranks of eu commissioner has been far from smooth .

" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west .

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .

the eu parliament voted against lifting the current weapons embargo against china . several member states of the european union count among the world 's leading weapons exporters , particularly great britain , france , germany , italy and sweden .
weapons policy , however , remains the domain of national governments , and the european parliament can only advise and suggest .
on wednesday it did just that , debating new restrictions on weapons exports and urging the bloc not to end its arms embargo on china . although officially the european parliament 's hands are tied regarding armaments questions , parliamentarians increasingly see it as their duty to comment on controversial developments .
this criticism has now been made into a 26-page report by spanish parliamentarian raul romeva rueda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament , strasbourg , france rueda 's report took issue with the eu 's code of conduct for weapons sales , which is supposed to provide a set of ethical guidelines for countries to follow .
however , the document , which was created in 1998 , is not legally binding .
the european parliament is overwhelmingly in favor of changing that . " the main problem with the code of conduct is that it is a very weak instrument , " rueda said . the code of conduct sets a series of minimum standards for arms exports .
those include stipulations that no weapons should be sold to countries that might use them to abuse human rights .
weapons are also not to go to countries where regional conflicts are taking place , or where weapons purchases will further poverty in the population . " some of the equipment being sent to countries is torture equipment , or equipment that is being used to apply the death penalty , " he said .
" you have electric sticks , for instance , that is sometimes used by some police to force confessions . " china arms embargo should stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man tries to pull a chinese soldiers away from his comrades in this june 3 , 1989 photo the question of the weapons embargo placed on china after the 1989 crushing of a pro-democracy uprising in tiananmen square has proved decisive among eu nations , although not in the parliament .
meps called on the eu council and member states to maintain the eu embargo with china and not to weaken the existing national limitations on such arm sales . while the eu legislature 's vote is not binding , it does carry some moral weight . according to eu external relations commissioner chris patten , china does not meet international standards on human rights .
while he added that the embargo is a matter for the leaders of eu member states , he was adamant that he did not want the embargo to be cancelled . " without making any direct link , we have … told china that lifting the embargo would be greatly assisted if they could take concrete steps in the field of human rights , " he told parliamentarians . france has taken the lead in calling for a lifting of the arms embargo but is has not found unanimous support among eu heads of state and it remains a controversial topic .
for conservative deputy thomas mann , who also heads the parliament 's tibet group , cancelling the embargo is unthinkable . " the prerequisites are simply not there , " he said .
" the eu is based upon the maintenance of human rights .
we ca n't go in the opposite direction . " about one half of the eu 's 25 member states are in favor of lifting the embargo .
now parliamentarians are pushing to make the code of conduct for arms sales legally binding so that if arms do begin going to china , stricter controls will be in place .
the netherlands , currently the president of the eu , has been drawing up a revised code . " we are also discussing measures in addition to the code of conduct that should prevent an increase in a flow of arms from europe to china should the embargo be lifted .
these measures are aimed at increasing transparency , " said dutch europe minister atzo nicolai . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament rejects arms sales to china chancellor gerhard schröder found himself isolated in the desire to lift an arms embargo against china on thursday .

" the rough estimation is that out of the 1,000 or so cases which are currently being looked at -lrb- by the eu competition office -rrb- , there are three which would apparently give rise to the transfer of responsibility according to the criteria agreed with president barroso , " a commission spokesman said . but the spokesman , jonathan todd , said he could not give further details on the cases , save to say that one involves allegations of a cartel in the bitumen industry . conflicts of interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes under the guidelines agreed with barroso , cases that kroes can not handle herself because of a perceived conflict of interest will be transferred to another commissioner . barroso 's 24-strong commission team won approval from the european parliament thursday after a three-week delay caused by fierce objections to his first-choice line-up .
it is expected to take office on monday . despite giving their approval to the team as a whole , several lawmakers said they remained concerned about kroes ' extensive past business links ; she has sat on the boards of more than 30 dutch and foreign companies . those links , which kroes has now entirely abandoned , have caused disquiet over whether she can be completely unbiased as the commissioner in charge of policing anti-trust policy and fair corporate play in the eu . two of the companies that kroes has been involved with in the past - british mobile telephone operator mmo2 and dutch shipping company royal pando nedlloyd - form part of her in-tray of looming investigations . mmo2 is under investigation by brussels over cross-border " roaming " tariffs charged by mobile operators , while royal pando is one of a number of shipping lines whose eu-permitted cartel is now under review . parliament agrees on commission earlier in the day , european union lawmakers approved the bloc 's new executive commission , ending three weeks of institutional limbo sparked by protests over comments on gays and women by an italian nominee .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy it all worked out in the end : jose barroso the european parliament voted by 449 votes in favor to 149 against , with 82 abstaining in the ballot , which was originally due at the end of october but was delayed by the row .
incoming commission chief jose barroso -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was originally supposed to have taken office on nov .
1 , is now expected to start work in brussels on monday , officials said . dissent over hungarian candidate after italy 's rocco buttiglione withdrew his nomination as the eu 's justice commissioner in october , the main obstacle preventing the european parliament from approving barroso 's new team appeared to have been removed .
but meps were still unhappy with a couple of other nominations including that of hungarian laszlo kovacs . although hungary 's 65-year-old former foreign minister has managed to avoid the fate of buttiglione , his ascent to the heady ranks of eu commissioner has been far from smooth .
kovacs was originally supposed to take up the post of energy commissioner but was deemed to be unfit for the post following his hearing at the european parliament in october . second shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for taxation and customs laszlo kovacs of hungary .
in his defense kovacs -lrb- photo -rrb- argued that he had too little time to prepare for the interview procedure as he was dealing with a domestic political crisis .
and although there was a groundswell of feeling among political groups in hungary that his candidature should be withdrawn altogether , the government stood behind its selection , and he was offered an alternative portfolio , that of customs and taxation .
tuesday was his second day of reckoning , and given his first failure , the spotlight bore down on him with added glare . " you said that your energy hearings were disappointing , to say the least , because you said you did not have the previous 24 hours to swot up on subject matter , " scottish mep john purvis said .
" i would like to ask you how much time you have spent swotting up on the tax issue . " kovacs argued that a commissioner need not know all the details of his department and seemed to win the approval of the parliamentarians by saying he was in favor of fiscal competition and was opposed to a french proposal for cutting aid to new eu member states who attract investors with lower corporate tax rates . he also defended his former communist party membership , arguing he had always been in favor of a more open policy towards the west . " in my political background , there is nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of , " kovacs told the parliament . well-received changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andris piebalgs of latvia , the new eu energy commissioner .
latvian andris piebalgs -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will replace euroskeptic ingrida udre , had no trouble convincing meps that he was capable of tackling the energy portfolio .
and italy 's franco frattini won the support of meps as the new commissioner for justice , freedom and security after assuring the panel he would promote tolerance and uphold the rights of minorities .
getting this far with the new commission has not been smooth sailing , and though after the hearings on wednesday some meps said they still had some concerns about kovacs , they were not enough to unseat the 25-member team . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de barroso names modified eu commission eu leaders gathered in brussels thursday for a summit focused on economic reform , but all eyes were on incoming eu commission president jose manuel barroso , who revealed a shuffled list of commission nominees .

from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .
" we are just doing our pioneering work there , " he said .
" our focus is to get china running completely and then take the same concept to india . "
residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .

residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .

residual uncertainty some business experts have been hesitant to support an outright embrace of the asia-pacific region since recession struck in 1997 .
although most of the countries have recovered from the financial crisis that unraveled after the thai currency collapsed and the international monetary fund stepped in with austerity measures , the days when thailand 's gdp plummeted by more than 10 percent have not been forgotten .
a bit of residual uncertainty and caution is therefore not unhealthy .
the world bank , which reported east asian growth would reach more than 7 percent in 2004 , has also warned that the outlook for further in the future was " uncertain . "
according to some growth for this year probably peaked during the first half and is now beginning to slow again .
in addition , the region has showed itself to be extremely vulnerable to high oil prices , as well as to a likely downturn in high-tech sectors resulting from a slowdown in the west .
on top of that , the world bank has warned of possible slowdowns in the region due to the threat of a us recession and risks connected to the inflated chinese real estate market and attempts by beijing to regulate inflation and slow growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.11.2004 german business looks to future in asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the bright star in the asia-pacific economy this week , german business leaders meet in bangkok for their bi-annual asia-pacific conference , where they hope to expand trade opportunities and strategies in one of the world 's fastest growing regions . the asia-pacific region is by far the biggest growth area worldwide .
from india to japan , the region includes vastly different countries , from economic powerhouse china to the still impoverished war-torn cambodia .
taken together , though , the region 's combined gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is set to rise for the first time to above € 7 trillion -lrb- $ 9.1 trillion -rrb- - surpassing even north america , and bringing the countries clearly into the focus of international business .
the potential for growth for german business is enormous .
at present , only 13 percent of german foreign trade is done with the asia-pacific region ; only 7 percent of german foreign direct investment finds its way to the region .
chinese mega-market of course china is the buzz-word , and the biggest exception , when it comes to german business ties in the region .
as the largest european trading partner , germany exported some € 1.8 billion worth of goods to china in 2003 and counted € 1.4 billion in direct investment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china , a member of the world trade organization , is the region 's biggest economy with 9 percent growth rate .
with an annual growth rate of 9 percent , china is an impressively strong market , and one many german firms are eager to get a piece of .
from carmakers such as vw and bmw to electronics giant siemens , many have opened up factories and regard the chinese market as key player in their own business development .
however , many managers of german companies are trying not to be too enthusiastic about the chinese market - at least for the moment .
william tate , ceo of german mining equipment specialist deutsche bergbau technik dbt acknowledged the prowess and attraction of china , but said it has n't yet outranked more traditional markets .
" it 's the hottest market , but not yet for us in terms of our real today business and where we 're making it , " tate said .
" germany is still the most important market , and the us is the second most important market .
but if we look five , six , or seven years in the future , at least half of all opportunities we know about are in china . "
looking beyond china other business leaders , like heinrich von pierer , the outgoing ceo of germany technology giant siemens and chairman of the asia-pacific committee of german business for more than 10 years , have said there is more to the region than just china .
" we are talking a lot about china , but it is not only china that is impressive .
if you look at other countries like malaysia , thailand , vietnam and singapore there are growth rates above 5 percent , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india could be new light in asia-pacific region .
the new big market player to watch in the region is india , pierer said .
" the indian government has decided to move forward and look to china and see how fast and successful it has been , " he said .
" and they want to copy that . "
but for tate , and other managers still working to get a foot into the chinese market , india is still a ways off in the future .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .

the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .

the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german carmakers face a bumpy ride german auto industry at risk peter hartz : the father of germany 's labor reforms 30,000 jobs on line at volkswagen volkswagen heading for bumpy 2004 ride business -pipe- 18.11.2004 german cars drop in reliability ratings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not as trustworthy any more ?
already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .
some german cars , once synonymous with reliability , are no longer living up to expectations .
steady decline in ratings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in it ’ s latest survey released in august , the uk-based consumer magazine which ? gave vw bad marks , putting it in the lowest “ poor ” category , a position it has now held for two years .
mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .
but they point to a few general trends . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese carmakers are giving the germans a run for their money .
for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .
“ perhaps the expansion has put pressure on their resources and internal quality control . ” “ with all the cost cutting , perhaps it is affecting their production standards , ” said whyte . duddenhöffer , however , was not inclined to agree with such theories .

already struggling with falling profits , rising production costs and increased competition from abroad , german carmakers are facing another challenge : a number of surveys show some of their cars are less reliable . it ’ s been a tough year for many german car manufacturers .
faced with increased competition from abroad and falling sales , executives are struggling to bring down production costs despite tough opposition from labor unions . earlier this month , volkswagen managers said they would cut costs by € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - 30 percent - ­ over the next seven years .
in july , daimlerchrysler threatened to move production to south africa if its stuttgart-based workforce didn ’ t accept a pay cut . but lurking behind these headlines is another story .

mercedes-benz , which used to be in the top “ best ” category has steadily slipped two notches into the “ average ” category .
audi , once judged to be “ good , ” is now considered “ poor , ” and bmw has gone from “ good ” to “ poor . ” other surveys , including that of us-based j.d. power and associates , show comparable results .
while bmw faired better , with only 264 problems per 1,000 vehicles - above the 269 industry average , audi and mercedes-benz , with 295 and 327 problems per 1,000 vehicles respectively , scored well below the average .
volkswagen , with 386 problems reported per 1,000 vehicles , was near the bottom of the list . japanese raise the standard the reasons for the decline are complicated and vary depending on the company and model in question .
and experts are quick to point out that not all german models have dropped off in ratings .

for one , they say it ’ s not necessarily just a case of german cars becoming less reliable .
it ’ s that they are comparatively less reliable than their japanese competitors , who have raised the bar with some models going up to five years without any trouble . “ the competitors are getting more reliable , rather than germans getting less reliable , ” graham whyte , an editor at uk-based newcarnet.co.uk , an online guide to new cars , told dw-world . richard headland , a principal researcher at which ? , agreed . “ japanese car makers are demonstrating that it is possible to build cars that are exceptionally reliable and that brings up the whole average , ” he said . too much technology ? for some high-end carmakers , like mercedes-benz , technology has proven to be the achilles heel .
in the competitive luxury car market , mercedes-benz has to be superior in two categories : quality and innovation , ferdinand duddenhöffer , a professor at the gelsenkirchen institute of automobile economics , told dw-world .
unfortunately , in the race to triumph over competitors , mercedes may have sacrificed quality . like other luxury german carmakers , mercedes incorporated technologically advanced electronic systems developed by so-called “ first-tier suppliers , ” separate companies like bosch , which make products such as abs breaks , electronic engine management systems , gps navigation devices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz ' e-class at a time when the average development time of new cars has shrunk from five years to 32 months , not enough so-called “ soak-testing ” time to establish the reliability of these new devices was allotted .
at mercedes-benz , that seems to have been the case with the introduction of the new e-class , a particularly problematic model . “ they are in too much of a hurry now to produce new cars from scratch and under increasing pressure to make ever more technologically sophisticated models , ” whyte said .
“ it ’ s the same if you plan a vacation in a hurry : you are bound to go wrong somewhere . ” ambitious expansion and declining quality control the root of the problem at more mass-market manufacturers like vw is a bit harder to pinpoint .
faulty advanced electronics - ­ - an industry wide problem - ­ - may have a bit to do with it , but most models are not nearly as complex as those of , say , mercedes-benz . experts can only guess . “ they have expanded by taking on seat and skoda , ” said headland of which ? .

the defendant says he got permission from a state interior ministry to make the threat . for wolfgang daschner , the choice on oct .
1 , 2002 was between following the letter of the law , or perhaps saving the life of a kidnapped child .
in the end , he opted to try to save the child and set off a roiling debate over the law and its limits , and where one draws the line in matters of life and death . the 61-year-old former deputy police president is accused of telling an interrogator to threaten intense pain on the kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , the son of a banker who had been abducted on this way home from school . " we wanted and had to save jakob 's life , " he told the court .
" i want to make it clear that at no time did i give the order to torture . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnus gäfgen , left , at his trial in 2003 , accompanied by his lawyer , hans ulrich endres daschner wrote a memorandum in his files remarking that the kidnapper , magnus gäfgen -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , would be questioned anew after threats of " the infliction of pain under medical supervision . "
according to daschner , the threat was the only way to possibly save the child . however , jakob at that point was already dead . despite his intentions , under german law , torture is illegal .
daschner is being charged in a frankfurt regional court with serious coercion in office .
he faces a sentence of between six months and five years .
the 51-year-old interrogator , who received the instructions from daschner , faces similar charges in court . ok from above the scope of the matter expanded further when daschner testified earlier that he got the go-ahead to threaten gäfgen from none other than his superiors at the interior ministry of the state of hesse .
daschner has refused thus far to reveal who he spoke to at the ministry , saying such information could wait for the trial . the as-yet unnamed official allegedly told daschner when the policeman asked about making torture threats : " do it !
show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .
he will argue that daschner 's actions were " necessary and proportionate to the situation . "
the question , he has said , is whether the police must sit and wait while " a kidnapped child dies an agonizing death .

show instruments ! " hesse 's interior minister , volker bouffier of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has said he has no evidence that his ministry ever gave daschner permission to make threats .
" we deny that absolutely , " he said during a committee meeting on monday . but günther rudolph , spokesman on domestic matters for the opposition social democrats , said there was a good deal of evidence of close communication between daschner and udo corts , the state secretary in the interior ministry at the time . " the number of participants was very small , " rudolph told reporters .
" it 's very disappointing that interior minister bouffier can not clear up the accusation . " public support daschner has found support among the german public , and even from some politicians and police chiefs .
for many , he is a hero , because he was doing all he could to save the life of an 11-year-old child . in a survey in the news magazine stern , 60 percent of those asked thought that daschner should not be punished for what he did . others , however , warn that despite some understanding for the magnitude of what was at stake , an absolute ban on torture should not be weakened .
lawyers and human rights activists have argued that there is no such thing as " a little torture . " prosecutors said at a hearing in february that despite the fact that daschner might have had a motive that was " understandable , " this did not make " in legal terms , the threat of torture an acceptable means " of interrogation . daschner 's lawyer , eckart hild , is seeking an acquittal for his client .
he will argue that daschner 's actions were " necessary and proportionate to the situation . "
the question , he has said , is whether the police must sit and wait while " a kidnapped child dies an agonizing death . " a verdict could be handed down before the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt deputy police chief charged in torture case prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .
someone should be looking into the weird goings-on in the university city a few hundred kilometers north of bielefeld . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de diana 's death : catastrophe or conspiracy ?

however , italian referee massimo de santis ruled out the effort claiming he had not blown his whistle . youthful defense proves solid klinsmann had put his faith in a youthful backline consisting of 20-year-old robert huth - who plays more for germany than he does for club chelsea ; hanover 's per mertesacker , 20 , and lahm , 21 , but there was no sign of nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe hands : lehmann keeps a clean sheet .

" we won almost all of our tackles and it was just a question of time before we scored , " klinsmann said .
" cameroon tried to kill the tempo of the game but we never allowed them to - that is what really pleases me . " for cameroon it was a missed chance to avenge their 2-0 defeat in the 2002 world cup and a miserable return for their german coach winfried schäfer . " we let the country down with that display , " schäfer said .
" i am infuriated at our lack of discipline .
i do not want to say anything else as i need to calm down . " winni on the dole after defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head coach german winfried schaefer utters his last words as cameroon coach .
schäfer had other things on his mind other than the temperament and attitude of his players after the game , like finding a new job .
cameroon sports minister siegfried etame massoma fired the former karlsruhe handler - whose contract ran until 2006 - shortly after the final whistle for poor results and serious errors of judgment according to cameroon state radio . the sports minister was not the only one seeing red .
germany took to the pitch sporting a new scarlet strip which had been adopted after klinsmann 's team of sports psychologists recommended the " aggressive " color for the new change kit .
the new approach almost paid off on 13 minutes but bernd schneider screwed his shot wide after a great solo run from philipp lahm . with 22 minutes gone , captain michael ballack then drilled a free-kick through a poor cameroon wall and ran off celebrating his 21st goal for his country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.11.2004 germany , brazil look for common ground großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at brazil 's political helm for two years now : lula da silva an old accord on nuclear energy and a new partnership with un ambitions are on the agenda for german foreign minister joschka fischer 's meeting with brazilian president lula da silva on thursday . brazil and germany are sure to agree on at least one point during fischer 's stop in brasilia : both countries are eager to have a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
to increase their chances , the governments have joined an alliance with two other hopefuls - japan and india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a show of unity : chancellor gerhard schroder with former president fernando henrique cardoso in february 2002 .
the decision by germany and brazil to pursue permanent seats dates back to february 2002 , when the two governments entered a " strategic partnership " as part of an overall bilateral action plan . political ties according to reiner radermacher of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , the german-brazilian relationship took on an added dimension with the election of lula da silva 's leftist government in october 2003 . " this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .
today , brazil is home to as many as three million descendants of german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen workers in sao paulo for over 50 years , germany and brazil have been building close economic ties .
sao paulo , with its volkswagen , bayer and basf factories , is the largest " german " industrial city in the world .
it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .
lula and his government wish to increase this figure to 25 percent over the next 12 years . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boosting latin american ties german foreign minister joschka fischer flew to new york sunday at the start of an americas trip focusing on berlin 's efforts to improve ties with latin america and gain a permanent seat on the un security council .

" this relationship is not dependent on the individual actors , even though schröder and lula come from the same direction politically , " radermacher said , adding that it is the increasingly unipolar world driving the two nations toward common action . long tradition close ties between germany and brazil are nothing new .
in 1824 , just two years after brazil 's declaration of independence , the country was already a magnet for german migrants destined for south america .

it 's the economic ties that have laid the foundation for more political cooperation , said radermacher . " objectionable accord " political decisions have in the past frequently been motivated by economic considerations , as was the case when in 1975 , former german chancellor helmut schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- signed the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy .
the accord regulated state support of the export of nuclear technology .
back then , brazil - far from being a democracy - was under military rule .
in radermacher 's view , there was always something objectionable about the nuclear accord . but martin traine , political scientist at the university of cologne , sees the issue differently .
the accord came about at the time of the cold war , when germany did n't get involved in the political affairs of other nations . " brazil is germany 's most important trading partner in south america , and economic relations were always more relevant than political relations , " traine said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the angra 2 nuclear reactor dome in angra dos reis , brazil while germany is now planning its long-term phase-out of nuclear energy in favour of alternative forms of energy , the brazilian government is hoping to extend the accord . if the accord is n't cancelled soon , it will automatically be extended for another five years .
a group of parliamentarians from germany 's junior coalition partner , the greens , have demanded that the accord be nullified , though economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- has spoken out against the move . diplomatic manoeuvres the brazilian government has struck a diplomatic note , agreeing to replace the accord with an energy cooperation pact that would include the use of renewable energy sources . the exact conditions of such a new pact are something for fischer to hammer out behind closed doors in his meetings with president lula . currently , brazil gets only 4 percent of its energy from nuclear reactors .

beatification is the first step toward canonization , or bestowing sainthood upon a person .
recent people beatified by the pope include mother teresa and the last austrian emperor , charles i. sermons smuggled abroad when clemens august preached against the nazis euthanasia program , worshippers had secretly noted down his sermons , and the anti-nazi resistance smuggled them abroad .
they were later broadcast to germany by the german service of the bbc . later evidence quoted by historians revealed that an enraged hitler wanted galen hanged , but that propaganda minister joseph goebbels warned this could lead to alienation among sections of the local catholic population among whom galen was highly popular .
hitler was then reported to have said he would " settle the score " with galen after the war . cardinal position awarded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clemens august , count von galen , in an undated photograph .
" the lion of münster , " as he came to be known , survived the war but only briefly .
he was born in 1878 , the child of aristocrats , ordained as a catholic priest in 1904 , and became head of the münster diocese in 1933 , the year the nazis came to power .
shortly before his death in 1946 the then pope elevated him to the rank of cardinal . the vatican began the beatification process at the end of last year by formally recognizing galen 's " heroic virtues , " one of the first steps in the procedure of beatification . afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "
those who have got out without being manipulated can give a detailed description of this facility . there have been a number of reasons given for the lengths that have been taken to hide the area known to most normal humans as bielefeld , all of which are just as far fetched . elvis , cobain and a teacher from the stars one revolves around the cult of ashtar sheran , a traveler from the stars who arrived on earth - at the point where bielefeld is situated - to educate humanity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis presley - coming to a ufo landing site near you .
shevan 's followers include elvis presley and nirvana frontman kurt cobain , both of whom are not dead as widely believed but were saved from the pressures of celebrity by the swedish secret service who gave them new identities .
keep your eyes peeled for the duo 's comeback which is expected on the site of shevan 's arrival . another involves the israeli secret service , mossad , which is involved in the establishment of a confidential research lab where bielefeld is supposedly situated ; the crossing point of two undocumented ley lines .
it is also supposed to be an opening to an ancient tunnel which runs from the united states to australia via the submerged city of atlantis . dragons , knights and orders from e.t. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas eve 2011 promises to be one to remember .
if that 's not enough , the third explanation for the concealment of the real nature of the site proposes that bielefeld inhabits the ground above a confidential cave system where a sleeping dragon dwells , a beast which will wake on the dec .
24 , 2011 .
this dragon from the fourth age is currently protected by ancient knights , who keep the beast sedated with mind-altering substances and who receive their orders from extra-terrestrials . whether this is all the product of fertile imaginations or an advert for the effects of prolonged drug abuse , one thing is clear .

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .
and then there was the official bielefeld homepage on the internet .
this web site sprang up showing idyllic vistas of the city 's avenues and prominent buildings .
but there was no solid evidence that these streets and buildings were images of bielefeld .
the students claim these could have been taken anywhere . arminia bielefeld or actor 's guild ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actors pretending to be arminia bielefeld .
possibly .
the conspiracy theory grew with the ascendancy of the previously forgotten soccer team , arminia bielefeld , which started to enjoy a moderate level of success in the top german league , putting the city 's name in the sporting arena . featuring aging stars and actors who the students allege are being paid to perpetuate the myth of bielefeld 's existence and a group of supporters on the same payroll , arminia bielefeld is a perfect facade of normality for the more sinister goings-on in this shadowy area of germany . according to the students , those who have escaped the city are the lucky ones .
most people who find themselves in the area just off the a2 motorway are abducted and manipulated at the top secret , ultramodern manipulation institution known as the " bielefeld center . "

it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist . it appears on the german map , the city has a bundesliga soccer team and regional train services include it as a destination .
it is home to 330,000 inhabitants and one of germany 's 20 major cities . but according to a group of students in the northern german city of kiel , bielefeld not only does n't exist but its creation and promotion is a disturbing conspiracy to hide a number of -lrb- im -rrb- possible secrets . the students from the university of kiel started to smell a rat after hearing about bielefeld for as long as they could remember but had never met anyone who had lived there , come from there or even visited the city in the westphalia region in northwestern germany .
it soon became a topic of discussion between them that maybe the town did n't actually exist . historical texts state the official founding of the city of bielefeld took place in the year 1000 .
in over a thousand years of existence , bielefeld looks to have kept itself pretty much to itself , with its main claim to fame coming from dr. august oetker , his renowned baking powder and the nationwide food business which developed from it and which still bears his name .
but despite this , the kiel students continued to muse about its existence . sudden appearance of city dwellers after casually voicing concerns , the students began to notice an increase in people claiming to have come from bielefeld , to have wandered the streets of this mythic location and those who had friends and relatives living there .
the students ' suspicions were aroused further by the seemingly distant looks and vacant expressions of those making these claims .
had they been manipulated ?
had the minds of these people been rewired as some part of a nefarious plan ? suddenly , the students noticed that a day would not go by without bielefeld making it into the local and national press .

they will force sellers to have surveys and local authority searches done before putting properties up for sale .
but critics say home information packs , which will cost about £ 600 , could go out of date before properties are sold and are a waste of money .
the housing bill comes into force on thursday , but the seller 's pack will not be compulsory until 2007 .
pilot schemes are due to start in 2006 .
the government says the housing bill will " help the most vulnerable and help create a fairer and better housing market " .
hundreds of millions of pounds are wasted each year when sales fall through before contracts are signed .
' through the wringer ' housing minister keith hill told mps on 8 november : " hundreds of thousands of people every year are put through the wringer because of the inadequacies of the current system . "
the commons overturned peers attempts to make the packs voluntary - mr hill argued sales chains could be disrupted if one seller did not use them .
but some professional bodies representing lawyers and estate agents are sceptical about the packs ' merits and " shelf life " .
they say parts of the pack , such as local authority title searches and home condition reports , could soon go out of date .

in a report by the commission for social care inspection giving ratings for the country 's 150 councils , cumbria is one of eight given zero stars .
the council says the inspection was carried out only shortly after an action plan for improvement had begun .
it says that means the rating does not reflect improvements which have been made since then .
this is the first year the commission for social care inspection has published ratings .
last year , the zero rating came from the social services inspectorate .
the report said the department was serving some adults well but the capacity to improve adults ' services was uncertain .
there is clearly much more work to do , but i know we have made significant progress since the inspection ended in march john mallinson , cumbria county council it said it was not serving children well and the capacity to improve children 's services was uncertain , which was an improvement .
cumbria county council cabinet spokesman for care and social services , john mallinson , said : " the inspectors have given then county council credit for a wide range of improvements .
" there is clearly much more work to do , but i know we have made significant progress since the inspection ended in march .
" that has been achieved by the hard work of all our staff under the leadership of the interim director for social services stephen wilds . "
the council said last year 's zero rating led to a range of improvement measures being agreed and it had received a letter from ministers saying they were encouraged by progress .
mr mallinson said : " we were well aware this inspection would lead to another nil star rating because of the timing .
" we also know that given the issues we had to address there was no quick fix .
" however the detailed report clearly identifies improvements even in the early part of this year .
a further six months has passed during which that work has continued . "

plymouth city council and the isles of scilly have been awarded no stars in a report by government inspectors , two of eight zero-star councils in england .
other social services in the region also came out badly .
cornwall lost a star , down from three to two as did devon county council which has dropped from two to one .
torbay retained its one-star rating .
the overall picture has a downward trend across the region paul snell , commission for social care inspection plymouth 's social services attained its no-star rating for the second year running .
the isles of scilly saw its rating drop after losing the one star it was awarded last year .
paul snell , the commission for social care inspection 's business director , said : " overall , this year 's star ratings will represent disappointment for councils in the south west , as the overall picture has a downward trend across the region .
" ultimately , what matters is the quality of social care services , which are available to people in the south west .
" these results show a number of councils will need to improve their social services , making them more responsive to the wishes and aspirations of service users and their families . "
zero-star councils automatically fall into special measures , meaning they are monitored monthly and have to produce an action plan to show how they will improve .
plymouth city council said major improvements had been made by its social services department , but not in time to regain a one-star rating .
improving services social services director john baker said the council recognised that poor performance was unacceptable .
he said : " we are improving but still have a long way to go .
we will continue to work closely with the commission for social care inspection and our partner agencies to improve further still . "
torbay council 's social services department said it was pleased to have retained its one star rating .
loretta mchugh of the council said : " the council has tackled many of the service areas identified as weak in its performance inspection , whilst continuing to invest in maintaining and improving a high quality services . "
cornwall 's social services department said despite its dropping a star , the report said it was still " serving people well " and had " excellent capacity for improvement " .

more than half also did not want children kept in secure accommodation .
