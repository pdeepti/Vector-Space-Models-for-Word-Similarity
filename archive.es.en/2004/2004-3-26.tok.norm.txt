with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .

24 , 2003 -rrb- germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .
born in 1975 , the man began studying electrical engineering in darmstadt in late 2003 , according to news reports .
citing unidentified sources close to germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the private news channel n-tv also reported that the attacks in madrid are believe to have been carried out by men who had been registered as living in the suburban area surrounding the cities of frankfurt and mainz for a number of years .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .
the eu is considering a similar request .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.03.2004 islamic bonds provide debt relief for german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonds get green light only if the " sharia board " approves .
the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .
born in 1975 , the man began studying electrical engineering in darmstadt in late 2003 , according to news reports .
citing unidentified sources close to germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the private news channel n-tv also reported that the attacks in madrid are believe to have been carried out by men who had been registered as living in the suburban area surrounding the cities of frankfurt and mainz for a number of years .
according to the report , the suspects had long been identified by authorities as islamic extremists and potential terrorists .
n-tv quoted a prominent german terrorism expert stating that investigators were following leads in a number of german states .
the cable network , a german affiliate of cnn , said spanish investigators had discovered the link after arresting three moroccan suspects on wednesday .
police believe the men have connections to the hamas terrorist organization and other extremist groups .
n-tv said the men were believed to be " jihadis " and had been known to authorities as extremists who were thought to be especially dangerous and capable of violence .
the men were reportedly legal residents of germany .
but german daily süddeutsche zeitung on friday reported that the man living in the darmstadt apartment had not been a known extremist .
the paper also wrote that earlier reports that more than one man had lived in germany could not be confirmed .
the presence of islamic extremists has been a dominant political issue in germany since it was discovered that several perpetrators of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states had been students in hamburg .
following the madrid attacks earlier this month , politicians in germany have mulled changes to the law that would make it easier to deport suspected terrorists from the country .
arrests continue in addition to the three arrests on wednesday , spanish police took another two men into custody on thursday , bringing the total number of arrests to 18 .
a total of 190 people died in the march 11 bombings of commuter trains in madrid - the deadliest act of terror in europe since pan am flight 103 was blown out of the sky over lockerbie , scotland in 1998 , killing 270 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.03.2004 islamic bonds provide debt relief for german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonds get green light only if the " sharia board " approves .
the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .
a spokesman said defense minister peter struck and his u.s. counterpart had agreed in february on a close coordination over the troops ' withdrawal .
rumsfeld had told struck that a final decision would be made by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .

enjoy your meal !
eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .

that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .

enjoy your meal !
eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .
a spokesman said defense minister peter struck and his u.s. counterpart had agreed in february on a close coordination over the troops ' withdrawal .
rumsfeld had told struck that a final decision would be made by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .

the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .
a spokesman said defense minister peter struck and his u.s. counterpart had agreed in february on a close coordination over the troops ' withdrawal .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .

the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .
a spokesman said defense minister peter struck and his u.s. counterpart had agreed in february on a close coordination over the troops ' withdrawal .
rumsfeld had told struck that a final decision would be made by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.03.2004 islamic bonds provide debt relief for german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonds get green light only if the " sharia board " approves .
the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .

here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .

a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .

" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .

let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .
born in 1975 , the man began studying electrical engineering in darmstadt in late 2003 , according to news reports .
citing unidentified sources close to germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the private news channel n-tv also reported that the attacks in madrid are believe to have been carried out by men who had been registered as living in the suburban area surrounding the cities of frankfurt and mainz for a number of years .
according to the report , the suspects had long been identified by authorities as islamic extremists and potential terrorists .
n-tv quoted a prominent german terrorism expert stating that investigators were following leads in a number of german states .
the cable network , a german affiliate of cnn , said spanish investigators had discovered the link after arresting three moroccan suspects on wednesday .
police believe the men have connections to the hamas terrorist organization and other extremist groups .
n-tv said the men were believed to be " jihadis " and had been known to authorities as extremists who were thought to be especially dangerous and capable of violence .
the men were reportedly legal residents of germany .
but german daily süddeutsche zeitung on friday reported that the man living in the darmstadt apartment had not been a known extremist .
the paper also wrote that earlier reports that more than one man had lived in germany could not be confirmed .
the presence of islamic extremists has been a dominant political issue in germany since it was discovered that several perpetrators of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states had been students in hamburg .
following the madrid attacks earlier this month , politicians in germany have mulled changes to the law that would make it easier to deport suspected terrorists from the country .
arrests continue in addition to the three arrests on wednesday , spanish police took another two men into custody on thursday , bringing the total number of arrests to 18 .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .

the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .

that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .
a spokesman said defense minister peter struck and his u.s. counterpart had agreed in february on a close coordination over the troops ' withdrawal .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

jó étvágyat !
enjoy your meal !
eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .

" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .
the eu is considering a similar request .

the index , closely watched as the barometer for the health of german business sentiment , fell to 95.4 from 96.4 in february , making it the second consecutive drop .
the expectations index - which mirrors businesses ' confidence about the future - fell to a six-month low of 98.9 . ifo economist hans-werner sinn said the latest figures showed that germany 's recovery was " clearly at risk " .
" the time has come to cut interest rates in europe , " he said .
the board of the european central bank - which sets rates for the 12-nation eurozone - meets next on 1 april , amid speculation that it might finally drop rates below the current 2 percent set last june .
the data was collected before and after the madrid train bombings on march 11 , which made little difference to the general gloom , sinn said . more briefs 26.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche telekom denies major revamp 26.03.2004 -pipe- infineon drops plans to move abroad 25.03.2004 -pipe- ex-vodaphone head testifies in mannesmann trial 25.03.2004 -pipe- lufthansa flies to profits 25.03.2004 -pipe- telekom exec resigns due to toll system fiasco 24.03.2004 -pipe- postbank plans july ipo 24.03.2004 -pipe- bundesbank profits fall to record low 23.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche post reveals top managers ' pay radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the index , closely watched as the barometer for the health of german business sentiment , fell to 95.4 from 96.4 in february , making it the second consecutive drop .
the expectations index - which mirrors businesses ' confidence about the future - fell to a six-month low of 98.9 . ifo economist hans-werner sinn said the latest figures showed that germany 's recovery was " clearly at risk " .
" the time has come to cut interest rates in europe , " he said .
the board of the european central bank - which sets rates for the 12-nation eurozone - meets next on 1 april , amid speculation that it might finally drop rates below the current 2 percent set last june .
the data was collected before and after the madrid train bombings on march 11 , which made little difference to the general gloom , sinn said . more briefs 26.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche telekom denies major revamp 26.03.2004 -pipe- infineon drops plans to move abroad 25.03.2004 -pipe- ex-vodaphone head testifies in mannesmann trial 25.03.2004 -pipe- lufthansa flies to profits 25.03.2004 -pipe- telekom exec resigns due to toll system fiasco 24.03.2004 -pipe- postbank plans july ipo 24.03.2004 -pipe- bundesbank profits fall to record low 23.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche post reveals top managers ' pay radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

schumacher was the main proponent of the relocation plans , aimed at lowering infineon 's tax burden , but which had sparked controversy in germany .
infineon 's chief financial officer peter fischl said schumacher 's decision to quit was a personal one and denied it had anything to do with possible financial problems of the group .
a report in the daily die welt had said the computer chip maker was facing " serious operational and strategic problems . "
but fischl insisted there were no plans to change strategy .
schumacher , who turns 46 next week , had been chairman of infineon since april 1999 , when the german electronics giant siemens turned its semi-conductors business into a separate company . more briefs 25.03.2004 -pipe- ex-vodaphone head testifies in mannesmann trial 25.03.2004 -pipe- lufthansa flies to profits 25.03.2004 -pipe- telekom exec resigns due to toll system fiasco 24.03.2004 -pipe- postbank plans july ipo 24.03.2004 -pipe- bundesbank profits fall to record low 23.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche post reveals top managers ' pay 23.03.2004 -pipe- strong euro dampens car industry profits 23.03.2004 -pipe- siemens denies outsourcing jobs radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .

the index , closely watched as the barometer for the health of german business sentiment , fell to 95.4 from 96.4 in february , making it the second consecutive drop .
the expectations index - which mirrors businesses ' confidence about the future - fell to a six-month low of 98.9 . ifo economist hans-werner sinn said the latest figures showed that germany 's recovery was " clearly at risk " .
" the time has come to cut interest rates in europe , " he said .
the board of the european central bank - which sets rates for the 12-nation eurozone - meets next on 1 april , amid speculation that it might finally drop rates below the current 2 percent set last june .
the data was collected before and after the madrid train bombings on march 11 , which made little difference to the general gloom , sinn said . more briefs 26.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche telekom denies major revamp 26.03.2004 -pipe- infineon drops plans to move abroad 25.03.2004 -pipe- ex-vodaphone head testifies in mannesmann trial 25.03.2004 -pipe- lufthansa flies to profits 25.03.2004 -pipe- telekom exec resigns due to toll system fiasco 24.03.2004 -pipe- postbank plans july ipo 24.03.2004 -pipe- bundesbank profits fall to record low 23.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche post reveals top managers ' pay radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .
born in 1975 , the man began studying electrical engineering in darmstadt in late 2003 , according to news reports .
citing unidentified sources close to germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the private news channel n-tv also reported that the attacks in madrid are believe to have been carried out by men who had been registered as living in the suburban area surrounding the cities of frankfurt and mainz for a number of years .
according to the report , the suspects had long been identified by authorities as islamic extremists and potential terrorists .
n-tv quoted a prominent german terrorism expert stating that investigators were following leads in a number of german states .
the cable network , a german affiliate of cnn , said spanish investigators had discovered the link after arresting three moroccan suspects on wednesday .
police believe the men have connections to the hamas terrorist organization and other extremist groups .
n-tv said the men were believed to be " jihadis " and had been known to authorities as extremists who were thought to be especially dangerous and capable of violence .
the men were reportedly legal residents of germany .
but german daily süddeutsche zeitung on friday reported that the man living in the darmstadt apartment had not been a known extremist .
the paper also wrote that earlier reports that more than one man had lived in germany could not be confirmed .
the presence of islamic extremists has been a dominant political issue in germany since it was discovered that several perpetrators of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states had been students in hamburg .
following the madrid attacks earlier this month , politicians in germany have mulled changes to the law that would make it easier to deport suspected terrorists from the country .
arrests continue in addition to the three arrests on wednesday , spanish police took another two men into custody on thursday , bringing the total number of arrests to 18 .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .
a spokesman said defense minister peter struck and his u.s. counterpart had agreed in february on a close coordination over the troops ' withdrawal .
rumsfeld had told struck that a final decision would be made by the end of the year . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. commander : troops ' move from germany a question of time dw-world spoke with the deputy commander of u.s. forces in europe , gen. charles wald , about the political and economic consequences of the military 's imminent eastward move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.03.2004 german government to lobby for permanent un seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for a permanent place at the table .
with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .

that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.03.2004 islamic bonds provide debt relief for german state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonds get green light only if the " sharia board " approves .
the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

schumacher was the main proponent of the relocation plans , aimed at lowering infineon 's tax burden , but which had sparked controversy in germany .
infineon 's chief financial officer peter fischl said schumacher 's decision to quit was a personal one and denied it had anything to do with possible financial problems of the group .
a report in the daily die welt had said the computer chip maker was facing " serious operational and strategic problems . "
but fischl insisted there were no plans to change strategy .
schumacher , who turns 46 next week , had been chairman of infineon since april 1999 , when the german electronics giant siemens turned its semi-conductors business into a separate company . more briefs 25.03.2004 -pipe- ex-vodaphone head testifies in mannesmann trial 25.03.2004 -pipe- lufthansa flies to profits 25.03.2004 -pipe- telekom exec resigns due to toll system fiasco 24.03.2004 -pipe- postbank plans july ipo 24.03.2004 -pipe- bundesbank profits fall to record low 23.03.2004 -pipe- deutsche post reveals top managers ' pay 23.03.2004 -pipe- strong euro dampens car industry profits 23.03.2004 -pipe- siemens denies outsourcing jobs radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

this office would be responsible for combating terrorism , cdu parliament member and security expert clemens binninger told the bild newspaper .
it would bundle the related jurisdictions currently held by 37 various national and state authorities .
the battle against terrorism must be consolidated , he said .
meanwhile , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has called for a territorial army similar to the u.s. national guard , with battalions that can be quickly mobilized in the case of a terrorist threat , the paper said .
according to a survey by infratest dimap on behalf of german public television ard , 60 percent of germans believe there will be terror attacks on german soil in the near future .
one year ago , this figure totaled 50 percent . more briefs 25.03.2004 -pipe- u.s. plans troop reductions in germany 25.03.2004 -pipe- east german spy christel guillaume dies 24.03.2004 -pipe- police probe internet spread of right-wing music 24.03.2004 -pipe- schily wants easier deportation of " suspect " foreigners 23.03.2004 -pipe- beleaguered bayern set to wield salary axe 23.03.2004 -pipe- famous romantic painting finds home in berlin 23.03.2004 -pipe- manhunt for suspected family killer 22.03.2004 -pipe- peta alters ' holocaust ' campaign in germany radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

jó étvágyat !
enjoy your meal !
eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .
born in 1975 , the man began studying electrical engineering in darmstadt in late 2003 , according to news reports .
citing unidentified sources close to germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the private news channel n-tv also reported that the attacks in madrid are believe to have been carried out by men who had been registered as living in the suburban area surrounding the cities of frankfurt and mainz for a number of years .
according to the report , the suspects had long been identified by authorities as islamic extremists and potential terrorists .
n-tv quoted a prominent german terrorism expert stating that investigators were following leads in a number of german states .
the cable network , a german affiliate of cnn , said spanish investigators had discovered the link after arresting three moroccan suspects on wednesday .
police believe the men have connections to the hamas terrorist organization and other extremist groups .
n-tv said the men were believed to be " jihadis " and had been known to authorities as extremists who were thought to be especially dangerous and capable of violence .
the men were reportedly legal residents of germany .
but german daily süddeutsche zeitung on friday reported that the man living in the darmstadt apartment had not been a known extremist .
the paper also wrote that earlier reports that more than one man had lived in germany could not be confirmed .
the presence of islamic extremists has been a dominant political issue in germany since it was discovered that several perpetrators of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states had been students in hamburg .
following the madrid attacks earlier this month , politicians in germany have mulled changes to the law that would make it easier to deport suspected terrorists from the country .
arrests continue in addition to the three arrests on wednesday , spanish police took another two men into custody on thursday , bringing the total number of arrests to 18 .
a total of 190 people died in the march 11 bombings of commuter trains in madrid - the deadliest act of terror in europe since pan am flight 103 was blown out of the sky over lockerbie , scotland in 1998 , killing 270 . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.03.2004 eu leaders want constitution deal by june großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're both happy .
acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .

according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .

should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .

that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .
born in 1975 , the man began studying electrical engineering in darmstadt in late 2003 , according to news reports .
citing unidentified sources close to germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the private news channel n-tv also reported that the attacks in madrid are believe to have been carried out by men who had been registered as living in the suburban area surrounding the cities of frankfurt and mainz for a number of years .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .
the eu is considering a similar request .

germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .

the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .

"
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.03.2004 german government to lobby for permanent un seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking for a permanent place at the table .
with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .
the eu is considering a similar request .

24 , 2003 -rrb- germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given .

federal authorities are investigating leads that the march 11 terrorist attacks in madrid may have been carried out by islamic extremists living in germany . a spokeswoman for german federal prosecutor kay nehm confirmed on friday that nehm has opened an investigation after agents searched an apartment in darmstadt in the central german state of hesse . a man arrested in spain and suspected of involvement in the madrid attacks allegedly lived there for several years .
born in 1975 , the man began studying electrical engineering in darmstadt in late 2003 , according to news reports .
citing unidentified sources close to germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- and the federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- , the private news channel n-tv also reported that the attacks in madrid are believe to have been carried out by men who had been registered as living in the suburban area surrounding the cities of frankfurt and mainz for a number of years .
according to the report , the suspects had long been identified by authorities as islamic extremists and potential terrorists .
n-tv quoted a prominent german terrorism expert stating that investigators were following leads in a number of german states .
the cable network , a german affiliate of cnn , said spanish investigators had discovered the link after arresting three moroccan suspects on wednesday .
police believe the men have connections to the hamas terrorist organization and other extremist groups .
n-tv said the men were believed to be " jihadis " and had been known to authorities as extremists who were thought to be especially dangerous and capable of violence .
the men were reportedly legal residents of germany .
but german daily süddeutsche zeitung on friday reported that the man living in the darmstadt apartment had not been a known extremist .
the paper also wrote that earlier reports that more than one man had lived in germany could not be confirmed .
the presence of islamic extremists has been a dominant political issue in germany since it was discovered that several perpetrators of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states had been students in hamburg .
following the madrid attacks earlier this month , politicians in germany have mulled changes to the law that would make it easier to deport suspected terrorists from the country .
arrests continue in addition to the three arrests on wednesday , spanish police took another two men into custody on thursday , bringing the total number of arrests to 18 .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .
" that is clear . "
the town of baumholder , for example , has a population of 5,000 .
it is also home to the same number of u.s. troops .
" so you can imagine what impact it would have if the base was closed , " schaefer said .
the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .
the german government has been reserved in its reaction .
a spokesman said defense minister peter struck and his u.s. counterpart had agreed in february on a close coordination over the troops ' withdrawal .

eu expansion is also bound to change europe 's kitchens .
the new member states are joining with their culinary specialties in tow - some of which might take some time getting used to .
here 's a sneak preview . baltic states : delicacies from estonia , latvia and lithuania have n't been able to conquer other european countries .
meat -lrb- pork , lamb and beef -rrb- is a staple food that usually gets served with berries and mushrooms .
blini , which are also omnipresent in russia , are small pancakes filled with sour cream or fish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lithuanian sausage seller more traditional baltic treats might not get past strict eu guidelines : fresh blood sausages that contain innards might have to be sold under the table in the future .
also threatened are giant salami sausages stuffed into pig bladders and yoghurt and cheese specialities made from raw milk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabbit malta : traditional maltese cuisine tends to be rustic .
a favorite is rabbit - roast , grilled or as a stew .
" widow soup " should n't be taken literally as it is a vegetable soup with goat cheese .
the archipelago 's proximity to italy is mirrored in malta 's kitchens , but british colonizers -lrb- perhaps less fortunately -rrb- also left their imprints behind . poland : vodka is n't just a polish speciality as the " little water " forms part of the country 's national identity .
outside the country , " zubrowka , " which contains buffalo grass and tastes a little like cinnamon , is one of the better known kinds .
polish machos would n't be caught drinking it as they think it 's a woman 's vodka .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spectators pour themselves a vodka during a folk music festival in a village east of warsaw .
poland has dozens of vodka producers , who even offer a kosher version , which apparently is much more gentle to the human head .
hangovers are even less likely if vodka 's enjoyed while eating one of poland 's famous sausage delicacies .
poles are also trying to get eu protection for " oscypek , " a smoked cheese made from sheep 's milk .
there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .
" the sweetness of your love is like cyprus ' sweet wines , " marc anthony apparently whispered into the ear of his lover , cleopatra . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu expansion .

there 's a slight problem with that , however : the slovaks are trying to turn their version into an export hit as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia : the slovaks call their sheep cheese " bryndza " and the eu has already recognized it as a regional speciality , which means that it can only be exported from slovakia .
it 's not taken europe by storm so far , however , and is barely known elsewhere except for some parts of austria .
" bryndza " is also the basis for slovakia 's national dish , " bryndzove halusky , " a kind of potato dumpling with bacon and sheep cheese . slovenia : a type of braided bread that 's called " struklji " is slovenia 's best known food and gets served with sweet , meat or vegetable fillings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine barrels another national product , " cvicek " is so important to slovenes that they fought hard during eu accession negotiations to get an exemption : " cvicek " is a red and white wine mixture , which only has about 5 percent alcohol - too little for eu norms .
now slovenes can keep producing , selling and drinking the wine and some hope that it might become popular elsewhere as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech republic : czechs like to drink - plum brandy , for example , which is better known as " slivovitz . "
there 's also the so-called " thirteenth spring " in czech spa town karlovy vary , which produces " becherovka , " a herbal liquor .
let 's not forget about beer , of course , the czech national drink .
two kinds exist , " desitka " and " dvanactka , " the former containing less alcohol than the latter .
needless to say , czechs also eat from time to time : bread and flour dumplings filled with fruit are famous . hungary : hungarians love their meat : debreczin sausages and salami are world famous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they go nicely with a glass of tokaj many meat factories will have to close down after hungary joins the eu , however , as they do n't fulfil hygiene requirements .
at first , hungarians also feared for their tokaj wines and their fruit schnaps , " palinka . "
after a bitter fight , slovaks can now produce the wine under the same name as well as three slovak villages bordering the region of the same name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus : wine 's a big one for cypriots as well .
they call it " kommandaria " and claim that it 's the world 's best sweet wine .
the recipe allegedly dates back to a knight from the medieval order of st. john , but it 's been known to exist since ancient times .

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .

with german troops safeguarding international security from the horn of africa to afghanistan , germany thinks the time is ripe to get what it has long lobbied for : a permanent seat on the un security council . speaking before the german parliament during his annual policy address , chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany was " ready for the responsibility " of a permanent seat on the powerful council . so far , only russia , china , france , the united states and great britain have permanent seats on the council .
germany , which contributes € 340 million to the united nations each year , has held a rotating seat since january 2003 .
the temporary seat allows germany to take part in the discussions of the 15-seat council , but does n't give it the right to veto decisions made by the u.n. , a right reserved for permanent members . the schröder government has made noise about a permanent seat before , but aides told the berliner zeitung that schröder plans to regularly address the subject in international meetings and one-on-one talks with world leaders in the coming year . schröder : japan , russia are in favor " our friends in france support us , and other important european partners as well , " schröder said on march 19 during a speech at the opening of the federal college of security studies .
" russia and japan are in favor and many others as well .
i 'm sure that in light of our contribution to the fight against international terrorism , our friends in america will also agree to support this wish . " the statements are another step in a new direction for german policy since the schröder government took power in 1998 .
after voting to send troops to kosovo in 1999 , marking the first time german soldiers served in conflict since wwii , schröder 's social democrat-green party coalition government has slowly begun redefining germany 's foreign policy goals .
in 1991 , german chancellor helmut kohl supported the u.s. military 's campaign in iraq with more than € 8 billion in financial help , equipment and weaponry . last year , schröder profiled himself on the international stage by being one of the most vocal opponents to the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq . germany 's peacekeeping commitment in justifying its security council lobbying , the government repeatedly points to its active involvement in peacekeeping missions .
there are roughly 7,000 german soldiers serving in international peacekeeping operations .
around 1,900 alone are serving in the un-mandated mission in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , center , is on patrol in a street in kabul while other soldiers follow him on an open jeep , background , in this jan 19 , 2002 file photo .
according to a statement of german ministery of defense on monday , march 4 , 2002 , german soldiers carried injured soldiers of the afghan northern alliance to a hospital in kabul on friday , march 1 , 2002 .
the german troops in kabul are part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- .
-lrb- ap photo / wolfram steinberg -rrb- " we do n't think it works when others pass mandates that we have to carry out , " a government source told the berliner zeitung .
" they need to give us a bigger part in the debate . " not only germany , but also countries that play key roles in asia , africa and latin america may be considered for permanent representation on the security council .
the calls come as part of a restructuring debate happening within the united nations . un secretary general kofi annan has asked a team of advisors to come up with recommendations for revamping the united nations by the end of the year .
if germany had its way , the security council would be expanded from 15 to 25 members , allowing for more permanent members than the current five . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking a place at the table in his speech before the united nations , chancellor gerhard schröder said germany was prepared to take on more responsibility including membership in the u.n. security council .
the eu is considering a similar request .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '
i think it 's a really integral way of doing business . "
no financial links to porn , gambling , alcohol or pork before the islamic bonds can go on the market , a " sharia-board " - a group of islamic experts - has to check if the investment opportunity is in accordance with islamic law .
not only does it forbid interest payments , it also bars financial links to industries involving alcohol , gambling , pornography , weapons or pork .
even though saxony-anhalt is highly in debt , the state has received positive ratings as a borrower from investment companies .
non-muslims have also expressed interest in the bonds , according to guehl .
saxony anhalt is breaking new ground with its interest in islamic bonds , and that has also meant a degree of skepticism .
guehl said he 's faced repeated questioning about the possibility that islamic organizations could use the scheme for money laundering purposes .
but he said that 's an unfounded concern .
" we always refer to the fact that the arab capital market has strict regulations on money laundering , and that , in addition to this , the u.s. bank citigroup , which is bringing the bonds onto the market , also has a precautionary strategy , so we feel that we 're in good hands , " guehl said . christine harjes -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .

the eastern german state of saxony anhalt has been looking for creative investments to ease its burden of debt , and has found a new source of funds in an unusual , high-growth market : islamic bonds . with € 16 billion -lrb- $ 19.5 billion -rrb- in debt , the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt is one of the poorest regions in germany .
in order to help get its debt under control , state leaders are expected to issue europe 's first islamic bond within the next few months .
should they succeed , saxony-anhalt will be among the increasing number of western borrowers looking to cash-rich muslim investors as a source of funds .
islamic bonds differ from regular bonds in that they pay no direct interest , which is forbidden under sharia law .
instead , they make regular payments based on profits from approved investments .
profits from leasing saxony-anhalt expects to issue around € 100 million worth of debt in a bond adapted to meet the requirements of sharia law .
the profits for investors would come from leasing transactions .
the state government would transfer the rights for the use of some state properties , such as the finance ministry , to a dutch foundation authorised to issue islamic bonds .
saxony-anhalt would continue to use the properties by paying leasing fees , meaning that the holders of the bonds receive rent from the properties instead of interest .
after five years , the state would buy back the rights to its properties .
axel guehl of saxony-anhalt 's finance ministry predicts a 3.8 to 4 percent rate of return to investors after the five year period .
the idea to issue islamic bonds developed out of conversations with arab investors , said guehl .
saxony-anhalt has never been dependent on muslim investors before , " but why should the state ignore a market that is growing so strongly each year ? "
guehl told dw-world .
he added that it 's not just about getting funds for the state coffers .
" we want to send this market a message , to say , ' look , here 's a region that 's openly considering issuing securities that are compatible with another legal culture and another financial culture .
we 're prepared to strengthen trade and cooperation with your region . '

acting out of a new sense of unity following the madrid bombings , eu leaders have set a june deadline to agree a constitution for the bloc .
at their summit in brussels , they also boosted joint action against terrorism . the leaders of the 25 current and future european union states seemed determined to move forward together as they tackled the issues on their agenda .
they agreed to revive stalled negotiations on an eu constitution , signaled greater cooperation on security issues with the appointment of the eu 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , and promised to implement a catalogue of economic reforms agreed in 2000 . in an effort to defuse a looming diplomatic conflict , eu leaders also pledged to accommodate any peace deal to reunite the mediterranean island state of cyprus before it and nine other mainly eastern european states join the bloc on may 1 .
constitution deadline irish premier bertie ahern , who currently holds the rotating eu council presidency , said his colleagues had agreed to wrap up talks on a first constitution for the enlarged bloc by their next summit on june 17 and 18 . eu commission president romano prodi and eu parliament president pat cox said they hoped a compromise could be reached before elections for the european parliament from june 10 to june 13 .
according to news reports , some states including france worry that constitution talks before the election might cause a " eurosceptic backlash from voters . negotiations over the proposed constitution stalled last december after both spain and poland insisted on more voting rights than guaranteed in the document .
they wanted to stick to a system set up in nice in 2000 , giving them almost as much weight as much more populous countries such as germany . under the proposed constitution 's so-called " double majority " system , matters will have to be approved by 50 percent of member states as well as 60 percent of the union 's population , hence considering population differences .
one compromise that 's already been suggested would require approval of 55 percent in both cases .
both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

both germany and france have been insisting on a double majority voting system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose luis rodriguez zapatero a compromise became possible after spain 's incoming premier josé luis rodríguez zapatero -lrb- photo -rrb- reversed his predecessor 's position and said he 'd be willing to negotiate .
that prompted polish prime minister leszek miller to reconsider his country 's opposition as well . during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , poland signalled its readiness to return to the negotiating table .
poland 's foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz on thursday reiterated his government 's change of heart , saying that poland did not rule out " the possibility of a compromise based on the double majority . " making the eu safer in the wake of the march 11 bomb attacks on spain , eu leaders swiftly agreed on measures to improve the safety of all europeans .
they pledged to implement by june measures already agreed on , such as the europe-wide arrest warrant , and joint investigation teams .
they also endorsed the appointment of the bloc 's first counter-terrorism coordinator , former dutch deputy interior minister gijs de vries .
however , there was disagreement over the extent of his mandate .
while some reports have billed de vries as the eu 's " anti-terror czar " , his role is mainly intended to cut through the red tape of the eu 's complex institutions to ensure smoother cooperation between brussels and the member states .
" the powers currently planned for the anti-terror coordinator are absolutely insufficient , " said luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker .
economic reforms talk of anti-terrorism measures dominated the brussels summit until the final day , when eu leaders turned their attention to a catalogue of economic reforms agreed four years ago with the aim of turning the bloc into the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
however , the only new initiative was to charge former dutch prime minister wim kok with reviewing the sluggish performance on implementing the reforms , and coming up with suggestions on how to re-start the process . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops agenda at eu summit european union leaders arrived in brussels on thursday for their annual spring summit .

u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .
base closures would have a massive impact on local communities . while the pentagon is downplaying media reports that the united states could withdraw up to half of its troops in germany , local regions who would be affected by this move are worried .
across germany , the united states has stationed some 71,000 soldiers .
some of the most significant bases are located in structurally weak regions , which are dependent on the purchasing power of the troops .
the kaiserlautern military community -lrb- kmc -rrb- , for example , is home to over 20,000 army and airforce troops , civilians and retirees , plus the same number of u.s. dependents .
according to the most recent annual economic impact report at the 435th comptroller squadron at ramstein air base , kmc last year pumped nearly $ 1.29 billion into the area ’ s economy .
that factors in everything from housing expenditures to construction to getting a haircut .
it also includes the 6,190 german employees who draw their salaries from the military community .
extensive impact " it is really a bit early to speculate , though , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate .
he told dw-world that it is n't clear yet which bases will be affected and to what extent .
" but if troops leave here , it will have extensive implications , " he added .

the fact that the united states plans to withdraw thousands of troops from central europe is no secret . but , according to the washington post report from thursday , the force reductions could be much higher than was expected .
the paper reported the u.s. administration was nearing approval of the plans as part of a global force realignment that may halve the u.s. military presence in germany .
it would also reduce the numbers of troops in japan and south korea .
germany not being punished douglas j. feith , pentagon undersecretary for policy , told the washington post the changes in troop levels were in no way connected to germany 's opposition to the u.s.-led war in iraq .
" the one thing i would strongly refute , because it comes up all the time , is the notion that we 're withdrawing forces to punish the germans somehow , " feith said .
" what we 're doing is not at all tied to current events .
we 're looking at this in terms of changes that will last decades . "
while not denying that plans call for cuts that deep , u.s. defence secretary donald rumsfeld said that the administration was just beginning to consult with allies and could not know until after that process what the outcome will be .

security is set to dominate the meeting , which comes in the same week as a memorial service for the victims of the madrid train bombings .
european leaders have agreed a range of security measures , including the naming of an anti-terrorism co-ordinator .
they have also set themselves a mid-june deadline to broker a deal on a landmark eu constitution .
co-operation ?
talks about such a constitution fell apart in december with disagreements over voting rights .
but with 10 new states set to join the eu on 1 may there is new momentum towards an agreement .
the first session was on security with plans for greater mutual assistance in the event of a terrorist attack .
dutch politician gijs de vries , who starts work on monday as the new anti-terrorism co-ordinator , will head the renewed effort pooling the gathering of europe-wide intelligence .
' good choice ' a spokesman for the uk government said : " from everything we have seen , he seems a very good choice .
" the most important thing is not who he is but that he does the job properly . "
new measures agreed include monitoring data from mobile phone calls and a single eu-wide arrest warrant .
the leaders of the 25 current and future members agreed a number of steps aimed at showing europe united in the face of terrorism : implementing already agreed counter-terrorism measures , such as a pan-european arrest warrant , harmonising penalties for terrorist crimes and freezing of assets held by outlawed groups retaining all telecommunications data , including mobile phone records , for an agreed minimum time to enable intelligence agencies to track calls stepping up security at eu ports .
but the bbc 's william horsley in brussels says persuading eu governments to share more of their sensitive information will not be easy .
there are also significant differences over how to respond to the terror attacks blamed on islamic militants , as well as how to treat europe 's growing muslim population .
earlier european parliament president pat cox appealed to heads of government before they arrived in brussels to find the political will to complete negotiations on the constitution before june 's eu-wide elections .
he said : " the time for a constitutional treaty settlement has come , and that time is now .
irish prime minister bertie ahern , the current eu president , signalled that " we have a changed atmosphere " and that " we all want to see a new constitution in place as soon as we can " .
compromise hint last year 's negotiations collapsed after accession state poland and existing member spain united to block a deal on voting rights .
meanwhile france and germany want a new system to reflect their bigger populations .
poland has hinted it is prepared to compromise and a change of leadership in spain could mean the proposed constitution regains momentum .
if that happens , tony blair will come under pressure from the lib dems and tories to hold a referendum on the issue .

more than 50 people have died in the wave of attacks which began with a raid on an army camp in january .
police say they suspect the governing party member of parliament najamudeen umar may have been involved in the raid , which killed four soldiers .
the muslim mp has denied the allegation .
mr najamudeen is an mp from narathiwat province and as such has parliamentary immunity against arrest .
while the police have succeeded in gaining arrest warrants for the mp and eight others on charges including treason and the theft of weapons , parliamentary approval must be given before he can be arrested .
police criticised the leader of his party , the thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra , has said that the issuing of the warrant does not mean mr najamudeen is a wrongdoer but that he will receive a fair trail .
police took steps to arrest the mp because of information they say they gleaned from another suspect in the case .
a thai police officer was among those recently killed but they have been sharply criticised for publicly identifying the politician and another mp and senator prior to any formal charges .
in the latest violence in the south a police sergeant was shot and killed in songkhla and a village elder wounded in narathiwat .
martial law still applies across the muslim majority provinces in the country 's south .
the government says it plans to install closed circuit television in state buildings and other sensitive areas to halt the escalation in what it called urban terrorism .
the violence has been blamed on islamic separatists in the south who the government fears may have combined forces with international networks .

so it came as a surprise to find offers for a former seaside toilet block being invited in excess of £ 25,000 .
in pictures : the loo with a view granted , its location may be one of the uk 's finest - just metres from charmouth beach in dorset - but what could an ex-loo , complete with " adjacent patio garden " , have to offer at such a price ?
planning permission , it turns out .
despite being run-down and completely uninhabitable in its current state , local planners say it can be converted into a beach chalet .
and at such a popular tourist spot , interest has grown during the month it has been on the market .
paul iles , of martin diplock estate agents , told bbc news online : " at the moment it is in a pretty sorry state .
" but the site does have planning permission to convert it to a day chalet , which would consist of a living area , a kitchen area , a shower and , naturally , a toilet .
' changed his mind ' " and a patio area outside with french doors . "
sunken into a bank , the 4.5m by 4m block has clear views over the beach at charmouth , a heritage coast village , where the average price of a two-bedroom detached home costs more than £ 250,000 .
with plumbing and a working electricity supply at the block , the idea of buying such a property begins to seem less absurd .
the former toilet block overlooks charmouth beach still split into gents ' and ladies ' facilities , mr iles says the planning permission includes being able to knock down the partition wall .
" we have had quite a considerable amount of interest , it is a wonderful position , only yards from the beach , " mr iles said .
" the owner is prepared to let us market it for another few weeks to see whether it would create even more interest over easter period , when many tourists come here . "
bought 18 months ago for what is believed to have been more than £ 37,000 , it is already back on the market .
" the gentleman owner merely changed his mind .
he wants the money to move on to other projects , " mr iles said .

education and fire officials will meet in swansea later to examine how to prevent the school blazes which caused up to £ 2m damage last year .
the organiser of the " save our schools " conference , firebrake wales , says there is an arson " epidemic " .
it says most school arson is on the spur of the moment and through boredom , although a number are grudge attacks .
the chaos which follows school fires can disrupt the lives of children , staff and parents for years , as rogerstone primary in newport , south wales , knows well .
the children 's work you ca n't possibly replace and that 's what they find most difficult to cope with primary head marilyn garnon the school was destroyed last april , and their new building may not be ready until the end of next year .
" it was very upsetting , " said lynne murphy , who has taught at rogerstone since 1977 , a year after it opened .
" it was during the easter holidays .
we have community use of the school and there was an evening class taking place when they were alerted by the sounds and smoke .
marilyn garnon of llwyncrwn primary says the fire was a nightmare " all the children living nearby and their parents headed towards the smoke , and they were standing outside seeing their school work going up in flames .
" in one cloakroom everything had burnt except one glove and they could n't understand why .
fire facts over 1,000 school arson attacks in britain last year cost £ 100m in the uk , the number of fires started deliberately is 56 % in the south wales fire service area , arson accounts for 86 % of all fires in the old county of gwent , nine of ten fires are arson children aged seven - 17 are to blame for a large majority of school arson a quarter of school fires are begun by children under seven " the only thing that survived was the admin area - the head 's office and secretary 's office , although they were smoke damaged , so we were able to save a lot of records . "
the school 's 370 pupils have since been split , with the infants in temporary classrooms near the site , while the older ones have to travel more than three miles daily to a stand-in school in malpas .
" we are very much a family school , " said mrs murphy .
" everyone mixes together and it 's prevented that a lot . "
' devastating ' acting head teacher liz miles said : " obviously it 's not convenient .
we are out of the rogerstone community , but our parents have been really supportive . "
another school damaged by fire was llwyncrwn primary in beddau , rhondda cynon taf , whose head , marilyn garnon , described the 1997 blaze as a nightmare .
" it was quite devastating , " said mrs garnon .
" you lose everything .
" you ca n't imagine how many resources you have in a classroom that just disappear overnight .
llwyncrwn primary 's new building has risen from the ashes " small things like tables and chairs are easy to replace , but the children 's work you ca n't possibly replace and that 's what they find most difficult to cope with . "
the damaged block has since been rebuilt , and its staff were consulted on the design .
the fire was begun in a recessed doorway , and mrs garnon specified that there should be none in the new building .
friday 's conference , at the swansea marriott , will hear from experts on fire prevention how to cut risks .
it will also include a presentation by the handler of the south wales fire service 's " sniffer " dog sam , who searches fire sites for causes , such as petrol .
fire officers in gwent say nine out of ten blazes in the area are begun deliberately .
firebrake wales say the figures " highlight the extent of the arson epidemic currently sweeping the country . "
anthony feasey of firebrake wales said ideally every school would have a sprinkler system .
the cost of installation in a new school is about four per cent of the budget , or about the same as carpeting , says mr feasey .
" most of the arson is opportunistic and from boredom , " said mr feasey .
" there are a number of grudge attacks , but what it really is a scale of social misbehaviour that leads to a minor fire and unfortunately a major fire . "

a row over peeling pool paint has caused much of the delay over its opening .
the spa project is funded in part by an £ 8m millennium commission grant .
there remains no projected opening date .

it has already claimed one casualty - leo madden , leader of the council 's labour group , resigned last week .
as leader of the council in 1999 , mr madden commissioned the millennium project , promising it would not cost taxpayers - who now face an £ 8.4m bill .
the project has been hit by delays , and was originally to be finished by 2000 .
built on gunwharf quays , near portsmouth harbour station , the spinnaker tower is to offer spectacular views across the harbour for an expected 500,000 visitors a year .
the development was first approved by the millennium commission in 1995 .
the semmens report is an 18-month internal investigation by the council .

the steel-domed building closed as an attraction in 1999 , due to low visitor numbers , wasting £ 11m of lottery money .
sheffield hallam university was given planning permission on friday to turn the building in brown street into its main student union venue .
the proposals include bars , a stage for bands and conference facilities .
public access the university bought the building last year from regional devlopment agency yorkshire forward for £ 1.85m.
it plans to relocate its school of cultural studies , currently based at psalter lane , into a brand new building on the site of the current students ' union .
critics of the university takeover had claimed the deal would mean the building would no longer be open to the public .
but the students ' union plans to run a full programme of events which will be open for anyone to attend .

it plans to relocate its school of cultural studies , currently based at psalter lane , into a brand new building on the site of the current students ' union .
critics of the university takeover had claimed the deal would mean the building would no longer be open to the public .

bbc news online gets views from the editors of jewish and catholic publications in the uk .
by ned temko editor of the jewish chronicle rarely has a film been so hyped and so criticised before it was completed , much less shown , than mel gibson 's the passion of the christ .
gibson places virtually all responsibility for christ 's death on jews ned temko particularly in the light of well-publicised allegations that the film took an almost medieval anti-jewish view of christ 's life and death , i went to london preview screening with more than a little apprehension .
nothing , however , prepared me for how bad the passion of the christ was .
it is bad history .
it ignores or traduces much of what we know about the political , social and religious context in which christ lived and preached and died ; and the context in which the gospels , decades after jesus ' crucifixion , at a time of roman political dominance , were written .
it is bad theology , at least in as much as it departs from mainstream christianity 's explicit rejection of the idea that the jews bear collective blame for the crucifixion .
and it is bad cinema - an orgy of violence of a sort which i have never before seen on screen .
gibson 's justification for this sado-pornography is that he did not want to sanitise christ 's death , and that christ 's final hours were hours of violence .
but good film-makers have always found a way to convey violence without revelling in it .
take , for example , spielberg 's schindler 's list .
gibson clearly lacked the talent , the desire , or both to find a way of conveying much beyond violence in this film .
the huge progress made by the mainstream christian churches and jewish communities in interfaith understanding is threatened ned temko how extraordinary that a movie about a death which , in christianity , is about much more than just death - one which is about hope , resurrection and redemption - should need an 18 rating .
in the first third of the film , gibson places virtually all responsibility for christ 's death on jews .
pontius pilate is portrayed almost as a character from friends , a likeable " new man " whom we even see chatting with his wife about the meaning of life after a hard day at the office .
this is a wilful disregard of what history tells us about a roman tyrant who ordered christ crucified , as he did hundreds of other jews .
in the rest of the film , we are treated to a lashing-by-lashing , stone-by-stone , nail-by-nail view of a man literally being tortured to death .
my concern is that for at least some who see the film , its contextless and relentlessly violent version of christ 's death will supplant the more subtle , more powerful and far more spiritual story that emerges from a careful , caring reading of the scriptures .
in the process , the huge progress made by the mainstream christian churches and jewish communities in interfaith understanding is threatened to be set back .
but my hope remains that this fabric of interfaith relations will prove strong enough to provide a forceful and coherent response based on what we know about the historical jesus , about pontius pilate and roman rule , and about the time in which the gospels were written .
by josephine siedlecka editor of independent catholic news as a catholic - familiar with the good friday services , and stations of the cross images on the walls of all our churches , i found mel gibson 's the passion of the christ for the most part , faithful to the gospels , very moving , and thought-provoking .
this is gibson 's personal meditation on the way of the cross , a brave project , wonderfully filmed .
the brief flashbacks to jesus ' childhood and ministry provide much-needed relief to the excruciating depiction of his torture and crucifixion .
i loved the portrayal of the relationship between jesus and mary .
it was fascinating to hear aramaic for the first time and latin .
however , the film censors have given it a certificate 18 and i feel they were absolutely right to do so .
many romans are also depicted as sadistic brutes josephine siedlecka i found the violence hard to take and excessive .
each generation seems to bring out a new film on the passion .
i wonder what this one says about ours ?
i did not find this film anti-semitic .
jesus and mary are jewish as are all the apostles .
so is the beautifully-drawn character of simon of cyrene who helps jesus carry the cross .
while some high priests condemn jesus , other walk away saying his trial is a sham .
many romans are also depicted as sadistic brutes .
the one consistently evil character is the devil - an androgynous figure - never far from the screen .
at the end we see it defeated , although i think this might have been more clearly spelt out .
the resurrection , without which christian faith means nothing , is depicted very briefly josephine siedlecka when jesus died , matthew 27:54 recorded : " when the centurion and those who were keeping watch over jesus saw the earthquake and what took place they were terrified and said : " truly this man was the son of god ! "
i did n't hear this in the film .
the resurrection , without which our faith means nothing , is depicted very briefly .
i hear some christian groups see this film as an evangelical tool and are encouraging everyone to go to it .
i do n't think they are right .
people would be more impressed with us if we really tried harder to behave like christians , trying to live the teachings of jesus , rather than forcing them to see a film .

two signs are being used on the a48 in newport and near a school in the vale of glamorgan .
solargen , the firm behind the signs say they do not record how fast the traffic travels unlike speed cameras .
the signs , known as variable messaging signs -lrb- vms -rrb- , work by an internal camera assessing the speed of oncoming traffic and flashing up messages in english and welsh warning the driver to slow down .
the signs are stand alone and do n't need a mains power source because it runs on solar energy collected by panels connected to the unit .

the solar-powered signs sense how fast motorists are travelling and warn drivers to reduce their speed .
two signs are being used on the a48 in newport and near a school in the vale of glamorgan .
solargen , the firm behind the signs say they do not record how fast the traffic travels unlike speed cameras .
the signs , known as variable messaging signs -lrb- vms -rrb- , work by an internal camera assessing the speed of oncoming traffic and flashing up messages in english and welsh warning the driver to slow down .
the signs are stand alone and do n't need a mains power source because it runs on solar energy collected by panels connected to the unit .
signs are already in place on newport 's a48 between langstone and chepstow and outside the village school in pendoylan in the vale of glamorgan .
but the signs are expected to be erected in carmarthenshire and in monmouthshire soon .
i think these signs will play a big part in trying to get motorists to reduce their speed in the future vivien davies , solargen vivien davies , who works at solargen solutions based in cwmbran said that the signs were proving very popular .
" motorists seem to like them because although they warn the driver to slow down , you do n't get caught speeding by the sign unlike a speed camera .
" and research by the transport research laboratory shows that they are more effective in reducing the number of drivers exceeding the speed limit than imposing fines .

sony , philips and digital paper pioneer e-ink have announced an electronic book reader that is due to go on sale in japan in late april for $ 375 -lrb- £ 204 -rrb- .
called librié , the device will be the size of a paperback book and can hold 500 texts in its onboard memory .
the device will also have a pc connection built in to allow owners to download fresh reading material such as newspapers and comics .
book here the display has a resolution of 170 pixels per inch , which e-ink says is comparable to the print quality of newspaper .
unlike more familiar lcd displays , the screen can be read at almost any angle and in bright sunlight as it uses tiny charged beads to form letters and images .
each pixel point on the display is a tiny pit containing a small number of black and white beads each one of which is about as wide as a human hair .
an image on the prototype reader the white beads are positively charged and the black beads negatively charged .
each pit is topped with a transparent electrode and has two other electrodes at its base .
changing the charge on the base electrodes makes either white or black beads leap to the top of the pit forming either a blank or black spot on the larger display .
making one base electrode positive and the other negative creates a grey spot .
the librié has been under development since 2001 and brings together technology from four companies .
e-ink and partner toppan make the basic electronic paper technology , philips is supplying the electronics to drive the display and sony has handled the design of the outer case .
the librié will weigh just over 300g including batteries and front cover and will run off four aaa batteries .
e-ink says the display only draws on battery power when text is refreshed which means it will be able to display about 10,000 pages before the batteries need changing .
the device is 13mm thick and its screen measures 15cm diagonally .
it also includes a qwerty keyboard , usb 2.0 connector and a slot for sony memory sticks .

book here the display has a resolution of 170 pixels per inch , which e-ink says is comparable to the print quality of newspaper .
unlike more familiar lcd displays , the screen can be read at almost any angle and in bright sunlight as it uses tiny charged beads to form letters and images .
each pixel point on the display is a tiny pit containing a small number of black and white beads each one of which is about as wide as a human hair .
an image on the prototype reader the white beads are positively charged and the black beads negatively charged .
each pit is topped with a transparent electrode and has two other electrodes at its base .
changing the charge on the base electrodes makes either white or black beads leap to the top of the pit forming either a blank or black spot on the larger display .
making one base electrode positive and the other negative creates a grey spot .
the librié has been under development since 2001 and brings together technology from four companies .
e-ink and partner toppan make the basic electronic paper technology , philips is supplying the electronics to drive the display and sony has handled the design of the outer case .
the librié will weigh just over 300g including batteries and front cover and will run off four aaa batteries .
e-ink says the display only draws on battery power when text is refreshed which means it will be able to display about 10,000 pages before the batteries need changing .
the device is 13mm thick and its screen measures 15cm diagonally .
it also includes a qwerty keyboard , usb 2.0 connector and a slot for sony memory sticks .

the british phonographic industry -lrb- bpi -rrb- is threatening to sue individual music fans who swap song files over the internet .
this follows action by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- , which has sued 1,977 downloaders .
bbc news online looks at what this could mean for music swappers around the world , and the issues behind the latest tactics .
i have downloaded music over the internet .
can i be sued ?
not if you have downloaded songs that have been put online with the approval of record labels and artists - which usually involves paying for royalties .
sanctioned services include apple 's itunes and napster in the us , plus mycokemusic , hmv and virgin in the uk .
if you download unapproved tracks from unsanctioned sites - whether it is one song or a million - you are infringing copyright and you run the risk of being sued .
could i be sued for swapping just a few songs ?
theoretically , you could .
but the bpi says the problem stems from a small hardcore of " serial uploaders " who offer hundreds or thousands of music files over the internet .
the riaa took action against a college student in michigan who ran a network offering more than 650,000 files - the equivalent of more than 43,000 albums .
they have chased other users who have again uploaded thousands of files .
can children be sued for uploading or downloading songs ?
the riaa says it could prosecute anyone , including children .
the bpi has not said if children will also be targeted .
why are record companies so worried ?
music sales are falling , with global annual record sales down from $ 40bn -lrb- £ 22bn -rrb- to $ 30bn -lrb- £ 17bn -rrb- over the past four years .
the bpi says the amount uk downloaders spend on albums fell 32 % between 2002 and 2003 , and that their spending on singles was down 59 % .
the music industry , which has suffered massive redundancies and restructuring in the last decade , says the swapping of music files over the internet is one of the major parts of music piracy .
it has sued online song-swapping services like napster , and is in the process of suing kazaa .
why is the bpi taking action now ?
in 2003 the bpi said suing individual users would be a " last resort " .
but recent research indicates that eight million people in the uk claim to be downloading music , 92 % of them using illegal sites .
why are they chasing individual users ?
the music industry has had mixed fortunes in its court actions against the companies that support file-swapping on the internet .
some have been successful - like the action which forced napster to close - and some have not .
last year a us judge ruled that two file-swapping networks , grokster and morpheus , were not responsible for what was traded on their systems .
however , the riaa was successful in getting telecommunications giant verizon to hand over details of customers who swap files .
this has allowed them to begin the process of gathering evidence against individuals .
are other music industry groups going to take similar action ?
germany , switzerland , denmark , spain and italy have already taken similar action , says the international federation for the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german police impounded computer equipment in 2003 in the town of furth that had been used to upload up to one million files .
in italy at least 75 actions have been taken .
will legitimate online services ever rival the peer-to-peer sites ?
the april 2003 launch of apple system itunes was a huge success , with more than five million songs downloaded in the first month .
so far the service is only available in the us , however .
microsoft plans a similar online music service .
coca-cola 's site mycokemusic.com launched in europe in january and said it attracted 700,000 visitors in its first two months .

last year a us judge ruled that two file-swapping networks , grokster and morpheus , were not responsible for what was traded on their systems .
however , the riaa was successful in getting telecommunications giant verizon to hand over details of customers who swap files .
this has allowed them to begin the process of gathering evidence against individuals .
are other music industry groups going to take similar action ?
germany , switzerland , denmark , spain and italy have already taken similar action , says the international federation for the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german police impounded computer equipment in 2003 in the town of furth that had been used to upload up to one million files .
in italy at least 75 actions have been taken .
will legitimate online services ever rival the peer-to-peer sites ?
the april 2003 launch of apple system itunes was a huge success , with more than five million songs downloaded in the first month .
so far the service is only available in the us , however .
microsoft plans a similar online music service .
coca-cola 's site mycokemusic.com launched in europe in january and said it attracted 700,000 visitors in its first two months .

the bpi says downloaders spend less on albums and singles the british phonographic industry -lrb- bpi -rrb- is threatening to sue individual music fans who swap song files over the internet .
this follows action by the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- , which has sued 1,977 downloaders .
bbc news online looks at what this could mean for music swappers around the world , and the issues behind the latest tactics .
i have downloaded music over the internet .
can i be sued ?
not if you have downloaded songs that have been put online with the approval of record labels and artists - which usually involves paying for royalties .
sanctioned services include apple 's itunes and napster in the us , plus mycokemusic , hmv and virgin in the uk .
if you download unapproved tracks from unsanctioned sites - whether it is one song or a million - you are infringing copyright and you run the risk of being sued .
could i be sued for swapping just a few songs ?
theoretically , you could .
but the bpi says the problem stems from a small hardcore of " serial uploaders " who offer hundreds or thousands of music files over the internet .
the riaa took action against a college student in michigan who ran a network offering more than 650,000 files - the equivalent of more than 43,000 albums .
they have chased other users who have again uploaded thousands of files .
can children be sued for uploading or downloading songs ?
the riaa says it could prosecute anyone , including children .
the bpi has not said if children will also be targeted .
why are record companies so worried ?
music sales are falling , with global annual record sales down from $ 40bn -lrb- £ 22bn -rrb- to $ 30bn -lrb- £ 17bn -rrb- over the past four years .
the bpi says the amount uk downloaders spend on albums fell 32 % between 2002 and 2003 , and that their spending on singles was down 59 % .
the music industry , which has suffered massive redundancies and restructuring in the last decade , says the swapping of music files over the internet is one of the major parts of music piracy .
it has sued online song-swapping services like napster , and is in the process of suing kazaa .
why is the bpi taking action now ?
in 2003 the bpi said suing individual users would be a " last resort " .
but recent research indicates that eight million people in the uk claim to be downloading music , 92 % of them using illegal sites .

fans of the franchise will be glad to hear that the 2004 edition is a marked improvement on last year 's disappointing outing .
but unreal doubters will find little here to persuade them to come on board .
unreal is about one thing only : online multiplayer mayhem .
for the uninitiated , it is a futuristic combat game in which teams of cyber punk-style warriors battle it out across post-modern , dystopian landscapes and blade runner-esque interiors with suitably impressive weaponry and heavy armament .
the game is very much in the style of a futuristic sport - and comes with a spectator option that allows the more passive players to simply watch battles between players across the world unfold online with a sportscast-style commentary .
trigger finger vehicles add greater depth to gameplay and more fun unreal is all about reaction times - first-time players will be astounded at the speed of the action with hordes of players sprinting around maps , bounding up and down in the artificial gravity and firing off pin-point accurate blasts with their chain guns / lightning guns / rocket launchers etc .
for anyone aged 30 and above the game is a bit of blur as everything happens at such unrelenting speed .
i may have to admit that i 'm a little too old to be able to play unreal effectively .
there is little preamble involved - it is blast or be blasted .
with professional tournaments now becoming established , the makers have ensured that there is a tremendous array of options to customise the game to your playing style .
the 2004 edition has followed the route of halo and battlefield : 1942 and included a number of vehicles , adding a whole new dimension to gameplay .
some of the outdoor maps are beautifully crafted and a new game mode , onslaught , adds a real tactical bite to proceedings .
if you have a powerful pc , the game looks great the look of the game has been improved too - although you will need a top-spec machine with a fast processor , loads of memory and a turbo charged graphics card to really exploit the higher graphical features .
the game needs more than five gigabytes of hard drive space - which astounds this 32-year-old who remembers games running in 32k of memory .
on the negative side , loading times for multiplayer maps are agonisingly slow and frustrating as you wait to jump into the action .

one of glasgow 's 6,000 addicts takes a dose of methadone gps who prescribe methadone say proposed changes will mean huge numbers dropping out of treatment and turning to crime to fund their habit .
but health officials say the claims are exaggerated and insist the service will never be jeopardised .
there are about 6,000 glasgow addicts who get a daily dose of methadone .
about 5,000 of them are in the methadone programme run by doctors based in local surgeries .
but many gps in the programme say greater glasgow nhs board now wants to cut the costs by reducing gp involvement and creating a more centralised service .
it could be a disaster with thousands of patients leaving treatment and going back to illegal drug misuse and crime dr richard watson they say that the current gp model has one of the best records in the world for keeping people in treatment .
one of them , dr richard watson , said he fears the worst .
he warned : " the proposals are deeply worrying and , potentially at least , it could be a disaster with thousands of patients leaving treatment and going back to illegal drug misuse and crime . "
research has suggested that if 500 people dropped out of the scheme the resulting crime wave would reach about £ 15m a year .
but health officials have accused the gps of scaremongering .
they say they have had their money for looking after methadone patients doubled .
i can absolutely assure the public and the people receiving methadone treatments that services will continue terry findlay terry findlay , the nhs board 's director of community services , said the dispute was about money and was connected to the new gp contracts .
" the scheme is not in crisis and we will ensure that it does not get to that state , " he said .
" we want gps to be involved , if they wish to be , in the future of the methadone programme .
" we will ensure that that happens , either through the gps or through alternative models .
" i can absolutely assure the public and the people receiving methadone treatments that services will continue . "
he said the programme needed to develop and grow due to increasing demand .
