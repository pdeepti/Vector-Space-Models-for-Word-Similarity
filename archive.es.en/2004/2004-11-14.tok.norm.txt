over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2004 boosting latin american ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer will meet with guatemalan president oskar berger german foreign minister joschka fischer flew to new york sunday at the start of an americas trip focusing on berlin 's efforts to improve ties with latin america and gain a permanent seat on the un security council . on his way to latin america , fischer is scheduled to make a brief stop in new york where he will deliver a speech in honor of german-american historian fritz stern , who has been awarded a prize from the leo baeck institute , a prominent jewish research center .
stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

a day after yasser arafat was buried , palestinians began taking stock of a future without the man who led their fight for independence , while europe and the us look at ways to revive the stalled peace process . in stark contrast to the dramatic outpouring of emotion among the palestinian people in ramallah on friday , arafat 's successors gathered solemnly for prayers on saturday at the muqata compound that had been a virtual prison for the last years of the palestinian leader 's life .
the newly appointed palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- chairman mahmud abbas , prime minister ahmed qureia and the caretaker head of the palestinian authority rawhi fattuh gathered at arafat 's marble tomb .
they were joined by the deceased leader 's nephew nasser al-qidwa and the palestinian representatives to the united nations for the intimate morning prayer service marking the end of the holy month of ramadan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian soldiers pray at the flower-covered grave of their deceased leader yasser arafat 's grave in ramallah after the ceremony , ordinary residents of ramallah filed past the burial site , reciting verses of the koran and kneeling at the grave of the only leader most of them had ever known , a man who championed their cause for two generations .
meanwhile the palestinian leadership began preparing for elections due to be held in two months time .
fattuh will serve as caretaker head of the palestinian authority for 60 days , at which time presidential elections must be held under palestinian basic law .
restoring the peace process many in the middle east and the international community are viewing the death of arafat and the election of a new leader as an opportunity to revive the stalled peace process .
on friday , president george w. bush promised to rally the international community to the cause .
" i believe we 've got a great chance to establish a palestinian state .
i would like to see it done in four years .
i think it is possible , " bush said after a summit with british prime minister tony blair .
blair , who has been pushing his us colleague to take a more active role in the peace process , said a palestinian state must be nothing less than a " proper democratic state " and the first step is to ensure that elections take place .

german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has traveled frequently to the middle east as a negotiator in the peace process , expressed condolences for the loss of arafat , but said it was time for the palestinian people to pull together and " find the strength to turn itself into a sovereign , independent and democratic state , existing side-by-side in peace with its neighbor israel . "
" everything must be done to ensure a civil transfer of power .
elections must lead to the naming of a legitimate leader , who is committed to the peace process , " fischer said in the name of the german government .
legitimate representation " i hope europe and the united states will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us in order to carry out the presidential elections , " palestinian negotiations minister saeb erakat told afp newswires .
" if we can do that , the transition will be smooth and will take the palestinians towards democracy , pluralism and peace . "
unlike arafat , the new head of the palestinian authority must be recognized by israel , he said .
since coming to power in early 2001 , israeli prime minister ariel sharon , with the support of washington , had boycotted arafat , rejecting him as an unsuitable partner for peace talks .
" in the last four years , the obstacle to peace was sharon , " jibril rajub , chief of security in the west bank and arafat 's former security advisor , told afp .
but the entire international community also needs to recognize and endorse the newly elected leader for the palestinian people in order for the peace process to succeed .
the united states , the european union , russia and the united nations - the so-called middle east quartet - need to work together with israel and the palestinians to make sure the roadmap to peace , which foresees the creation of an independent palestinian state , can be realized . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yasser arafat laid to rest in ramallah amid scenes of mass grief and chaos , the body of the deceased palestinian president yasser arafat made its final journey to its resting place in the grounds of his ramallah compound in the west bank .

german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has traveled frequently to the middle east as a negotiator in the peace process , expressed condolences for the loss of arafat , but said it was time for the palestinian people to pull together and " find the strength to turn itself into a sovereign , independent and democratic state , existing side-by-side in peace with its neighbor israel .

unlike arafat , the new head of the palestinian authority must be recognized by israel , he said .

the newly appointed palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- chairman mahmud abbas , prime minister ahmed qureia and the caretaker head of the palestinian authority rawhi fattuh gathered at arafat 's marble tomb .

a day after yasser arafat was buried , palestinians began taking stock of a future without the man who led their fight for independence , while europe and the us look at ways to revive the stalled peace process . in stark contrast to the dramatic outpouring of emotion among the palestinian people in ramallah on friday , arafat 's successors gathered solemnly for prayers on saturday at the muqata compound that had been a virtual prison for the last years of the palestinian leader 's life .
the newly appointed palestine liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- chairman mahmud abbas , prime minister ahmed qureia and the caretaker head of the palestinian authority rawhi fattuh gathered at arafat 's marble tomb .
they were joined by the deceased leader 's nephew nasser al-qidwa and the palestinian representatives to the united nations for the intimate morning prayer service marking the end of the holy month of ramadan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian soldiers pray at the flower-covered grave of their deceased leader yasser arafat 's grave in ramallah after the ceremony , ordinary residents of ramallah filed past the burial site , reciting verses of the koran and kneeling at the grave of the only leader most of them had ever known , a man who championed their cause for two generations .
meanwhile the palestinian leadership began preparing for elections due to be held in two months time .
fattuh will serve as caretaker head of the palestinian authority for 60 days , at which time presidential elections must be held under palestinian basic law .
restoring the peace process many in the middle east and the international community are viewing the death of arafat and the election of a new leader as an opportunity to revive the stalled peace process .
on friday , president george w. bush promised to rally the international community to the cause .
" i believe we 've got a great chance to establish a palestinian state .
i would like to see it done in four years .
i think it is possible , " bush said after a summit with british prime minister tony blair .
blair , who has been pushing his us colleague to take a more active role in the peace process , said a palestinian state must be nothing less than a " proper democratic state " and the first step is to ensure that elections take place .

german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has traveled frequently to the middle east as a negotiator in the peace process , expressed condolences for the loss of arafat , but said it was time for the palestinian people to pull together and " find the strength to turn itself into a sovereign , independent and democratic state , existing side-by-side in peace with its neighbor israel . "
" everything must be done to ensure a civil transfer of power .
elections must lead to the naming of a legitimate leader , who is committed to the peace process , " fischer said in the name of the german government .
legitimate representation " i hope europe and the united states will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us in order to carry out the presidential elections , " palestinian negotiations minister saeb erakat told afp newswires .
" if we can do that , the transition will be smooth and will take the palestinians towards democracy , pluralism and peace . "
unlike arafat , the new head of the palestinian authority must be recognized by israel , he said .
since coming to power in early 2001 , israeli prime minister ariel sharon , with the support of washington , had boycotted arafat , rejecting him as an unsuitable partner for peace talks .
" in the last four years , the obstacle to peace was sharon , " jibril rajub , chief of security in the west bank and arafat 's former security advisor , told afp .
but the entire international community also needs to recognize and endorse the newly elected leader for the palestinian people in order for the peace process to succeed .
the united states , the european union , russia and the united nations - the so-called middle east quartet - need to work together with israel and the palestinians to make sure the roadmap to peace , which foresees the creation of an independent palestinian state , can be realized . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de yasser arafat laid to rest in ramallah amid scenes of mass grief and chaos , the body of the deceased palestinian president yasser arafat made its final journey to its resting place in the grounds of his ramallah compound in the west bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.11.2004 departing eu chief laments divided europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi , right , is giving directions until barroso takes over the commission before handing over the leadership to a new commission , outgoing eu commission president romano prodi said he regretted the european union remains divided over crucial economic and foreign policy issues . speaking on belgian national television sunday , prodi , who is stepping down from his five-year-term at the helm of the european commission , lamented the inability of the 25-member bloc to find common ground on key issues .
the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .
a recipe for failure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso is waiting in the wings to take over once the european parliament approves his commission team prodi has stayed on as a caretaker head in brussels after his successor , jose manuel barroso , withdrew his new team amid a veto threat by eu parliamentarians , .
a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .
" the door is open .. but it will take time , we have to work together openly and transparently .
otherwise european public opinion will not agree , " he said . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome hosts the prestigious signing ceremony of the new european constitution friday .

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .

to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.11.2004 europe faces new integration challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is not just a dutch problem the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .
many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands , tuesday , nov .
9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children wait outside a muslim school in eindhoven , netherlands , monday , nov .
8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .
better cooperation within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students and their parents of the tarieq ibnu ziyad islamic elementary school form a human chain in the southern dutch city eindhoven , friday nov .
12 , 2004 .
" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .

but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands , tuesday , nov .
9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?

8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .
better cooperation within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students and their parents of the tarieq ibnu ziyad islamic elementary school form a human chain in the southern dutch city eindhoven , friday nov .
12 , 2004 .
" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .
on nov .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .
a recipe for failure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso is waiting in the wings to take over once the european parliament approves his commission team prodi has stayed on as a caretaker head in brussels after his successor , jose manuel barroso , withdrew his new team amid a veto threat by eu parliamentarians , .
a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .
" the door is open .. but it will take time , we have to work together openly and transparently .
otherwise european public opinion will not agree , " he said . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome hosts the prestigious signing ceremony of the new european constitution friday .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .

the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .
the media can only benefit from doing so , as deutsche welle 's bobs ' nominees from the rest of the world show that there 's a lot to offer outside the us and english . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .

a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .
" the door is open .. but it will take time , we have to work together openly and transparently .

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .

9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .

8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .

9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?

8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.11.2004 bollywood comes to german tv großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bound to fascinate : " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " most germans have never seen indian films with their elaborate satins and silks and lavish musical numbers .
but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .
international producers are currently working with indian media production companies to make more films for foreign markets , hoping that bollywood becomes a movement with a future , and that that future has just begun . ana lehmann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business , politics , bhangra and more even on an everyday level , there 's little doubt that india is increasingly making its presence felt in germany .

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .
the media can only benefit from doing so , as deutsche welle 's bobs ' nominees from the rest of the world show that there 's a lot to offer outside the us and english . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .
on nov .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .
the media can only benefit from doing so , as deutsche welle 's bobs ' nominees from the rest of the world show that there 's a lot to offer outside the us and english . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.11.2004 bollywood comes to german tv großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bound to fascinate : " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " most germans have never seen indian films with their elaborate satins and silks and lavish musical numbers .
but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .
on nov .
8 , berlin had written to brazil requesting a review of the bilateral nuclear accord ahead of fischer 's visit . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 nations bid for permanent security council seat germany , japan , brazil and india - the so-called g4 group - launched a joint effort for permament seats on the united nations security council after meeting on the fringes of the un general assembly in new york .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .
on nov .
8 , berlin had written to brazil requesting a review of the bilateral nuclear accord ahead of fischer 's visit . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 nations bid for permanent security council seat germany , japan , brazil and india - the so-called g4 group - launched a joint effort for permament seats on the united nations security council after meeting on the fringes of the un general assembly in new york .

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .

a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.11.2004 europe faces new integration challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is not just a dutch problem the current wave of violence against muslims in the netherlands has forced all of europe to stop and examine the problems of integration .
many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands , tuesday , nov .
9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children wait outside a muslim school in eindhoven , netherlands , monday , nov .
8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .
better cooperation within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students and their parents of the tarieq ibnu ziyad islamic elementary school form a human chain in the southern dutch city eindhoven , friday nov .
12 , 2004 .
" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "

8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?

at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?

8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .

a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands , tuesday , nov .
9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .
the media can only benefit from doing so , as deutsche welle 's bobs ' nominees from the rest of the world show that there 's a lot to offer outside the us and english . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .
international producers are currently working with indian media production companies to make more films for foreign markets , hoping that bollywood becomes a movement with a future , and that that future has just begun . ana lehmann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business , politics , bhangra and more even on an everyday level , there 's little doubt that india is increasingly making its presence felt in germany .

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .

in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .

but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?

19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.11.2004 boosting latin american ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer will meet with guatemalan president oskar berger german foreign minister joschka fischer flew to new york sunday at the start of an americas trip focusing on berlin 's efforts to improve ties with latin america and gain a permanent seat on the un security council . on his way to latin america , fischer is scheduled to make a brief stop in new york where he will deliver a speech in honor of german-american historian fritz stern , who has been awarded a prize from the leo baeck institute , a prominent jewish research center .
stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands , tuesday , nov .
9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?

8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

12 , 2004 .
" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .

in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?

but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de weblog awards -pipe- 14.11.2004 what the us could learn about blogging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vote now for your favorite weblog bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in . deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international best of the blogs awards proved people all over the world are using weblogs to publish their thoughts on everything from yachting to handicraft tutorials .
over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .
the media can only benefit from doing so , as deutsche welle 's bobs ' nominees from the rest of the world show that there 's a lot to offer outside the us and english . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .
a recipe for failure ?

a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .
" the door is open .. but it will take time , we have to work together openly and transparently .

on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .

" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .
a recipe for failure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso is waiting in the wings to take over once the european parliament approves his commission team prodi has stayed on as a caretaker head in brussels after his successor , jose manuel barroso , withdrew his new team amid a veto threat by eu parliamentarians , .
a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .
" the door is open .. but it will take time , we have to work together openly and transparently .
otherwise european public opinion will not agree , " he said . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome hosts the prestigious signing ceremony of the new european constitution friday .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .
the media can only benefit from doing so , as deutsche welle 's bobs ' nominees from the rest of the world show that there 's a lot to offer outside the us and english . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de weblog awards -pipe- 14.11.2004 what the us could learn about blogging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vote now for your favorite weblog bloggers may claim they talk about the same subjects the world over , but deutsche welle ’ s best of the blogs exposed regional differences in blogospheres - and the competitions they take part in . deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international best of the blogs awards proved people all over the world are using weblogs to publish their thoughts on everything from yachting to handicraft tutorials .
over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .
international producers are currently working with indian media production companies to make more films for foreign markets , hoping that bollywood becomes a movement with a future , and that that future has just begun . ana lehmann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business , politics , bhangra and more even on an everyday level , there 's little doubt that india is increasingly making its presence felt in germany .

" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .

dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .

in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .

but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .

german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .

the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

many worry that what the dutch are now facing could soon be an eu-wide reality . it started with the murder of theo van gogh at the beginning of november in amsterdam .
the shooting of the controversial film maker and critic of islam set off a series of unprecedented attacks in the netherlands .
mosques were set in flames , churches were desecrated , schools were bombed and alleged terrorists arrested .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands , tuesday , nov .
9 , 2004 .
in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children wait outside a muslim school in eindhoven , netherlands , monday , nov .
8 , 2004 after an explosion blew the door off the school and shattered windows across the street .
but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .
better cooperation within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students and their parents of the tarieq ibnu ziyad islamic elementary school form a human chain in the southern dutch city eindhoven , friday nov .
12 , 2004 .
" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?
how can we help them bridge the gap to society ?

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .
a recipe for failure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso is waiting in the wings to take over once the european parliament approves his commission team prodi has stayed on as a caretaker head in brussels after his successor , jose manuel barroso , withdrew his new team amid a veto threat by eu parliamentarians , .
a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .

while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .
the media can only benefit from doing so , as deutsche welle 's bobs ' nominees from the rest of the world show that there 's a lot to offer outside the us and english . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : hacking against neo-nazis ?
even though the results did n't come as a surprise , many germans were shocked at the success of extreme right-wing parties celebrating their success in two state elections .
german bloggerville also had something to say .

in the last two weeks , at least 20 arson attacks have claimed the headlines across the country as tit for tat violence escalates .
the public is up in arms , while the rest of europe watches with a combination of shock and worry .
spiral of violence many in the traditionally tolerant society have been quick to point their finger at the spiral of violence and call it a growing trend towards fanaticism .
both the muslim community , which makes up about 6 percent of the population and has lived side-by-side with the dutch for years , and anti-immigrant supporters have attacked each other in words and deeds as one act of violence is quickly followed by a counter-act .
amsterdam mayor job cohen recently drew back the illusionary cover of tolerance and integration , laying bare the sentiment on the street , when he said hatred and fear exist between the various ethnic groups .
recent opinion polls show the majority of dutch people are uncomfortable with or feel threatened by the presence of foreigners , especially fundamental muslims , who oppose the openness of western society .
at the same time , support is surging for geert wilders , regarded as the heir to murdered politician pim fortuyn , whose party surged to second place in a 2002 election on a platform espousing tougher anti-immigration policies .
meanwhile , dutch deputy prime minister gerrit zalm said his country was engaged " in a war with terrorism . "
jozias van aartsen , parliamentary leader of the power-sharing vvd liberals , echoed that view on thursday in a parliamentary debate when he said the government 's prime focus was seizing militants and dialogue with mainstream muslims was secondary .
a european problem ?

but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?
what are the rights and duties of migrants , and of society ?
how can we make parents aware of their responsibilities for integrating their children ?

but if the netherlands is at war , than it is not going at it alone .
european justice commissioner antonio vittorino warned that the violence the dutch people are experiencing could break out in any other eu member state .
" it 's happening now in the netherlands , " his spokesman said friday , " but it affects the entire union . "
ulrich schneckener , political scientist from the berlin institute for research and politics -lrb- swp -rrb- , told dw-world he doubts that the dutch problems will spread to the rest of europe .
" i think the whole discussion about the spread of violence is extremely speculative , " the terror expert said .
" just because one country is being targeted , does not automatically mean terrorism will find its footing at the heart of europe . "
schneckener added .
nonetheless experts such as the well-known islam researcher bassam tibi worry that similar attacks could soon take place in germany .
" if nothing is done to improve the integration of foreigners , germany could possibly face the same civil war-like conditions now experienced in holland , " tibi told the newspaper münchner merkur friday .
system failures what is certain , though , is that the attacks in germany 's neighbor are the result of the failure to integrate and deal effectively with the challenges of immigration , said marianne zepp from the heinrich böll institute , which is funded by the greens party .
" but general conclusions can not be drawn for all of europe , " she told dw-world .
" however , what becomes obvious is that a strained economic and social situation can further intensify the already tense cultural relations between immigrants and the rest of a society in europe , " she said .
many other eu member states have difficulties with integrating immigrants .
in germany , france or spain , even the second and third generation of immigrants struggle with learning the language or finding a job .
the results for the rest of society are obvious : unemployment , poverty and criminality rise .

" europe must focus on giving foreign minorities a better chance to integrate by improving , for example , their education chances , " said zepp .
she praised the " handbook for integration " , which the eu commission presented earlier in the week at its first-ever conference on integration and anti-racism .
" the eu states must work together and learn from one another , " she said .
the handbook , which encourages cooperation and the exchange of information and experience among eu countries is an important first step in cross-border cooperation on the issue of integration .
dutch integration minister rita verdonk , who opened the eu conference stressed that the goal for the future is not simply finding a theoretical framework , but rather an " approach that really works . "
she said the eu needs to ask itself as a whole , " how do we prepare migrants for full participation in society ?

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .
a recipe for failure ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso is waiting in the wings to take over once the european parliament approves his commission team prodi has stayed on as a caretaker head in brussels after his successor , jose manuel barroso , withdrew his new team amid a veto threat by eu parliamentarians , .
a new vote is scheduled on thursday and barroso hopes to take office next week , and begin getting on with the work he was appointed to do .
the italian politician lamented that the eu constitution , signed with great fanfare in rome last month , falls short of his hopes , notably because it leaves veto rights intact in many policy areas .
" with 25 countries , it is impossible to take decisions , " he said .
the constitution should have helped streamline the voting process , but instead it offers two different decision-making systems : double majority , which requires support of 55 percent of member countries , representing 65 percent of the bloc 's population , and simple majority vote .
to make the situation more complicated , certain sensitive areas , such as foreign , economic and defense policy , are excluded from majority voting .
on the issue of admitting turkey , which hopes to win an eu greenlight at a summit in december , prodi said politicians must work hard to persuade europe 's skeptical public of the potential benefits .
" the door is open .. but it will take time , we have to work together openly and transparently .
otherwise european public opinion will not agree , " he said . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de historic day marred by commissioner controversy rome hosts the prestigious signing ceremony of the new european constitution friday .

the eu constitution , which should have been seen as a good opportunity to clear up any differences , does not go far enough in integrating power , prodi said .
" europe is still divided , " he said , citing for example problems with agreeing on economic policy .
" we have the euro but we do n't have a harmonized economic policy . "
the stability and growth pact rules underpinning the euro , which is currently shared by 12 of the eu 's current 25 member states , were effectively suspended last year after eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite serious and repeated breaches of the euro zone 's criteria for maintaining good budgetary discipline .
" it is a very , very difficult problem ... to have a single currency and not to have a single policy to protect that currency .
there is a great risk , " prodi added , in what he said he hoped was his last interview before leaving office .

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .

but one german network is bringing a bollywood soap opera to television , hoping it will catch on . bollywood , a word play on bombay and hollywood , is the name of the film genre which has boomed in india for decades .
popular in asia , africa and in many parts of europe , bollywood has also become a major trend .
but while most germans have never seen a bollywood production , german broadcasters are hoping to entice them by airing a bollywood film for the first time on german television next week .
german private broadcaster , rtl ii , will air the three-hour epic " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " on nov .
19 .
the film is a big family drama with a simple , easy-to-follow narrative structure .
it 's actually a typical soap opera , even if the faces and costumes of the characters are foreign to german viewers .
but if some things will be new and strange for germans , the emotional themes of the films are universal .
and this , said the rtl film director , minea bauer , is the difference between bollywood films and american or german productions .
kitsch factory " it is highly believable , emotional drama , " she said .
" they are , of course , melodramatic films that are not told in a rational way , but which through their telling , transmit a lot of emotion .
and the depth of the characters is something that has been lost in big hollywood films in the past few years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year and a half ago , the movie played in german cinemas .
but the three-hour epic with german subtitles was too much for most germans and it only attracted 7,000 viewers .
rtl ii hopes the german dubbing will attract larger audiences .
" we worked really hard on dubbing the film for over three months , " said bauer .
" and it was n't so easy when you consider that in many places the film suddenly jumps to a musical number , and you have to get the bridges between dialogue and song right , not to mention translating idiomatic and colloquial expressions , and continually finding ways to explain to viewers what is going on , because there are so many cultural differences . "
bollywood is often referred to as the biggest dream and kitsch factory of the indian subcontinent , producing elaborate stories of love and longing , with dance and song numbers that are immensely popular in india .
as multifaceted as hollywood and although more films come out of bollywood each year than hollywood , until now , they have n't presented serious competition for american productions .
but this might be changing , bauer said , because the films are worth seeing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " sometimes happy , sometimes sad " " these films have improved dramatically in quality in the past few years , " she said .
" this genre is so brilliant , so emotional , we should n't keep it from the german public . "
one advantage of the indian productions is their price .
at about $ 10-12 million -lrb- € 7.7 to 9.3 million -rrb- , they are much cheaper than hollywood films .
the private broadcaster hopes to reach eight percent of the german audience with this first dubbed bollywood film .
" firstly , it 's really important to us to bring these wonderful , beautiful films to the german public , and we want to see them succeed , " said bauer .
" and on the other hand , it 's simply a great industry with excellent stories and just as multifaceted as hollywood .
international producers are currently working with indian media production companies to make more films for foreign markets , hoping that bollywood becomes a movement with a future , and that that future has just begun . ana lehmann -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business , politics , bhangra and more even on an everyday level , there 's little doubt that india is increasingly making its presence felt in germany .

stern , a professor emeritus at columbia university , fled nazi germany in 1938 .
the 78-year-old has written numerous books and is considered one of the foremost american scholars on germany .
on monday , fischer will continue on to guatemala where he meets with his counterpart jorge briz , who visited berlin in october .
a foreign ministry spokesman said friday that the visit is intended to underscore german support for the reform policies of president oscar berger and the peace process after guatemala 's devastating civil war .
" with this visit , germany is pointing the way toward continued german involvement in the guatemalan peace process , " spokesman jens plötner said .
guatemalan peace process on what will be his first official visit to central america , fischer will hold talks with berger , 1992 nobel peace prize winner and human rights activist rigoberta menchu and the outgoing german head of the un verification mission in guatemala -lrb- minugua -rrb- .
the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

the mandate for minugua , created by the un to ensure compliance with peace agreements signed between the guatemalan government and the urng guerrilla group in 1996 after a long-running civil war , runs out at the end of 2004 .
fischer 's visit and his focus on the work of minugua is intended to demonstrate germany 's involvement with un work around the globe as part of a campaign to acquire a permanent set for germany on the 15-member un security council .
while in guatemala , the foreign minister will also speak with the un under-secretary general for political affairs , kieran prendergast , and the director of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in guatemala , birgit gerstenberg .
next stop : brazil on wednesday , fischer will travel to brazil , one of germany 's strongest supporters in its bid for a security council seat .
the south american country has agreed with berlin to support each other 's ambitions for permanent chairs at the table , where so far only britain , china , france , russia and the united states have non-rotating seats and veto powers .
following their differences with washington over the iraq war , germany and brazil view an expansion of the council as central to limiting us " unilateralism " on the world stage .
the plan to increase the number of permanent members on the powerful council is part of upcoming proposals to reform the institution and has also been backed by india , which hopes to gain a seat as well .
while in the brazilian capital , fischer will meet with foreign minister celso amorim and president luiz inacio lula da silva and speak at the german-brazilian chambers of commerce and industry in sao paolo - the largest center for german investment outside the united states and the european union .
phasing out nuclear energy just ahead of fischer 's visit to brazil , the south american country agreed to replace its 30-year-old nuclear accord with germany with an energy cooperation pact to include the use of renewable energy sources .
according to a letter delivered to the german embassy in brasilia , the " brazilian government considers it appropriate to substitute the brazil-germany cooperation accord on peaceful uses of nuclear energy with a cooperation accord in the energy sector . "
the letter , which was obtained by afp newswires on saturday , said the pact had " accomplished its central objectives " and that the " evident progress and diversification of energy generating technologies in the past two decades " justifies negotiating a new type of cooperation .
germany , which has been working to phase out its own nuclear power plants , has been a strong advocate of encouraging other nations to adopt alternative forms of energy .

over 1,000 weblogs were suggested for the bobs - the best of the blogs - some commenting on international politics and others on what the blog ’ s creator did last saturday night .
even when bloggers use similar descriptions for the topics they cover , " journalism , " " media " and " technology " themes top the list .
but deutsche welle ’ s international weblog competition has confirmed that the blogosphere isn ’ t a homogeneous place .
instead it ’ s one where language and culture play influential roles - even when bloggers claim they ’ re talking about the same topics .
while not a scientific study , participation in the bobs voting has shown stark differences between blogospheres .
whereas portuguese readers have come out en masse , with 5,707 voting for their favorite blog in the language ’ s best journalism category , just 303 people have taken part in voting to decide which blogs received the english language ’ s best journalism user award .
are portuguese bloggers just better at mobilizing readers to go and vote than their english-language counterparts or do the differences lie somewhere else ?
award burnout " there are already us blog competitions , " jim romenesko of the poynter institute told dw-world .
" maybe americans are sticking with those contests . "
in addition to well-known weblog awards like the bloggies , which started in 2001 , and its counterpart the anti-bloggies , many british and american newspapers also sponsor annual competitions .
the english language could be suffering from award burnout .
it ’ s a feeling that bobs nominee dave shea , author of mezzoblue , said he could imagine setting in the blogosphere psyche .
" i have n't won a ton of awards , " shea said .
" but even so , the first one is always more significant than the seventh or 21st . "
election mania this year timing is also an issue .
in early november most bloggers around the world had one thing on their mind - who would be the next us president .
the bush-kerry debate held the attention of bloggers in all seven of the bobs ’ competition languages - arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish .
but while the world ’ s bloggers were examining america , american bloggers were scrutinizing themselves .
characteristic of the rest of american media , bloggers in the united states , home to the world ’ s most blogs , were busy looking inward and analyzing what was happening in their own backyard rather than looking out into the international arena .
soon the blogosphere will see whether the end of the election means the inward-oriented us bloggers will start looking abroad for ideas and influences .

destina japan says many of the women believe japanese men do not understand their need to have a career , but feel western men are more open-minded .
most clients live in the uk , but some are prepared to pay thousands of pounds to travel from japan to meet a mate .

' modern attitude ' they are still outnumbered by single japanese men , but many women are rejecting the idea of a traditional marriage .
hiroko ozawa , founder of destina japan , said : " we have hundreds of female members living in japan who want to date men in the uk , " she said .
" japanese women like the fact that british men have a modern attitude to family life and marriage as well as a deep respect for the traditional aspects of the japanese culture . "

four thousand people died after an explosion and toxic gas leak at a pesticide factory owned by us company union carbide in 1984 .
union carbide india limited was responsible for cleaning up the site .
but thousands of tonnes of toxic waste are still stored inadequately nearby , poisoning the town 's water supply .
we took a sample of drinking water from a well near the site .
disputed results it had levels of contamination 500 times higher than the maximum limits recommended by the world health organization .
the local people who drink this water every day are exposing themselves to a substantial chemical hazard associated , over time , with liver and kidney damage .
union carbide disputes the test results .
the company says when it handed the site back in 1998 it " found no evidence of groundwater contamination " .
when we presented details of the chemicals we found , it said it was " not aware of any evidence to support such claims " .
but there are still thousands of tons of toxic waste on the abandoned and dilapidated site , lying in piles exposed to the weather .
we found pools of mercury lying on the ground , skips full of poisonous material and in some sheds , chemical waste in bags that was still highly dangerous .
in one building on the site , the atmosphere was so poisonous i could barely breathe .
when it rains - especially in the monsoon season - rainwater washes these chemicals into puddles , streams and eventually into the ground water .
unsurprisingly the wells have become contaminated .
but people drink from them all the same .
those who do , complain of a pattern of symptoms , including pains in the stomach , headaches , anaemia , and gynaecological problems .
although they know the water is unclean , they say they have no other source to drink from .
