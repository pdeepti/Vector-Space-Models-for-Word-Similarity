dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .

the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .

the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .
he has come under criticism from left-leaning members of german society , particularly from trade unions .
they have argued that the german president should address issues more wide ranging than just economic ones . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , horst köhler will become germany 's ninth postwar president .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .
but the netherlands were presented with fresh hope six minutes later when andrade , stretching to intercept van bronckhorst 's cross from the left sent it spinning over the head of his own goalkeeper for an own goal .
it was a lifeline for the dutch but ultimately one they were unable to grasp . lineups : portugal : ricardo pereira ; ricardo carvalho , jorge andrade , nuno valente , miguel ; luis figo , costinha , deco , nuno maniche -lrb- fernando couto 87th -rrb- , cristiano ronaldo -lrb- armando petit 68th -rrb- ; pauleta -lrb- nuno gomes 75th -rrb- . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; michael reiziger , jaap stam , wilfred bouma -lrb- rafael van der vaart 55th -rrb- , giovanni van bronckhorst ; edgar davids , clarence seedorf , phillip cocu ; marc overmars -lrb- roy makaay 46th -rrb- , ruud van nistelrooy , arjen robben -lrb- pierre van hooijdonk 81st -rrb- . referee : anders frisk , sweden afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the bigger they are , the harder they fall the fall-out from euro 2004 elimination is threatening the reputations and careers of some of the major stars who crashed out with their teams , specifically david beckham and zinedine zidane .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuno gomes celebrates the win euro 2004 host portugal dominated the netherlands on wednesday to secure the country 's place in the final this weekend .
the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .

the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team .

it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2004 europe 's mini-states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of britain in the south of spain : the rock of gibraltar since its enlargement in may , the eu now spans across large parts of the continent .
but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .

the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .

about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live people and politics we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .

with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .
greece : nikopolidis , seitaridis , kapsis , dellas , fyssas , basinas , katsouranis , zagorakis , vryzas , haristeas , karagounis .

reports leaking from the greek camp suggest that the row revolves around a demand by the players for more money than they were promised for reaching the last four .
the squad were set for a € 100,000 bonus but now apparently want € 300,000 each .
the greek fa is confident they can find a compromise .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .

beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .

" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .

already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .

beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .

" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .
greece : nikopolidis , seitaridis , kapsis , dellas , fyssas , basinas , katsouranis , zagorakis , vryzas , haristeas , karagounis .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .

" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .

i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2004 europe 's mini-states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of britain in the south of spain : the rock of gibraltar since its enlargement in may , the eu now spans across large parts of the continent .
but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

ten days after his car spun out at 330 kph -lrb- 198 mph -rrb- and hit the wall backward at the u.s. grand prix , ralf , the younger brother of ferrari world champion michael schumacher , discovered that he has two spinal fractures . the extent of his injuries did n't become known until schumacher underwent a six-hour long examination by doctors in the western german spa town of bad nauheim .

u.s. doctors overlooked the extent of schumacher 's injuries .
" i was shocked , " schumacher said in an interview with bild .
" i was examined from head to foot in indianapolis .
i do n't know what the doctors there were doing .
this will have consequences . " schumacher 's german doctors have ordered him to rest for up to three months while his injuries heal .
that could mean that schumacher will miss the rest of the formula one season , which ends in sao paulo on oct .
24 . getting back on the track formula one legend niki lauda , who survived one of the most horrific crashes in the sport 's history , told bild that the longer it takes schumacher to get back into the cockpit , the harder it will be for him to overcome the fear of racing again . but schumacher said that he wants his body to be strong enough to be able to endure another such crash before he races again , adding that no matter how long it takes , fear wo n't stop his return to the sport .

in the meantime we are fortunate to have a driver of marc 's calibre to fill the void . " it 's not the first time gene has stepped in for schumacher .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "

" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuno gomes celebrates the win euro 2004 host portugal dominated the netherlands on wednesday to secure the country 's place in the final this weekend .
the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .
but the netherlands were presented with fresh hope six minutes later when andrade , stretching to intercept van bronckhorst 's cross from the left sent it spinning over the head of his own goalkeeper for an own goal .
it was a lifeline for the dutch but ultimately one they were unable to grasp . lineups : portugal : ricardo pereira ; ricardo carvalho , jorge andrade , nuno valente , miguel ; luis figo , costinha , deco , nuno maniche -lrb- fernando couto 87th -rrb- , cristiano ronaldo -lrb- armando petit 68th -rrb- ; pauleta -lrb- nuno gomes 75th -rrb- . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; michael reiziger , jaap stam , wilfred bouma -lrb- rafael van der vaart 55th -rrb- , giovanni van bronckhorst ; edgar davids , clarence seedorf , phillip cocu ; marc overmars -lrb- roy makaay 46th -rrb- , ruud van nistelrooy , arjen robben -lrb- pierre van hooijdonk 81st -rrb- . referee : anders frisk , sweden afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the bigger they are , the harder they fall the fall-out from euro 2004 elimination is threatening the reputations and careers of some of the major stars who crashed out with their teams , specifically david beckham and zinedine zidane .

the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .
but the netherlands were presented with fresh hope six minutes later when andrade , stretching to intercept van bronckhorst 's cross from the left sent it spinning over the head of his own goalkeeper for an own goal .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .
greece : nikopolidis , seitaridis , kapsis , dellas , fyssas , basinas , katsouranis , zagorakis , vryzas , haristeas , karagounis .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .

municipalities will receive federal funds to help pay for the reform . the new law , known as hartz iv , will take effect on jan .
1 after a mediation committee consisting of members of both houses of the german parliament agreed on a compromise . the reforms affect about 1.6 million germans who have been unemployed for more than a year as well as about 1 million people who are currently receiving social welfare payments because they can not work . until now , long-term unemployed have received a larger sum of money and had to pay for their own housing .
now , single people will receive only about € 345 -lrb- $ 420 -rrb- per month while municipalities will take over paying rent . the change is central to the government 's labor market reforms , which are intended to reduce germany 's rampant unemployment .
currently , about 4.2 million people are unemployed in the country . under the new law , long-term unemployed will now have to accept almost any job they are offered and agree to move across the country if necessary or risk losing some or all of their financial aid from the state . billions for municipalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 're in deep water " : holding up town signs , many mayors all over germany jumped into swimming pools last year to alert people to their cities ' financial problems .
government and opposition leaders finally hammered out a compromise wednesday night after agreeing to increase transfer payments to municipalities to help them deal with the extra costs of paying for housing .
while the government had originally offered € 2.56 billion , local authorities will now receive € 3.2 billion . " the tug-of-war is over , now the work starts , " german labor minister wolfgang clement said . opposition politicians including roland koch , the christian democratic premier from the central state of hesse , said that the agreement was acceptable . " it was better to reach a compromise than letting the bill fail , " he said , adding that he also welcomed a pilot project that allows 69 counties and cities to take over the handling of long-term unemployed completely . koch said christian democrats were convinced that local governments could do a much better job than germany 's federal labor office . but critics of the change said that they expected chaos come january as neither the labor office nor municipalities would have enough time to prepare . " this is going to become a catastrophe just like the toll disaster , " hermann-josef arentz , head of the christian democrats ' social welfare committee , told bavarian public broadcaster br , referring to germany 's planned truck toll system , which was supposed to go into operation almost a year ago . both houses of parliament are expected to finally approve the compromise legislation next week . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .

" i was examined from head to foot in indianapolis .
i do n't know what the doctors there were doing .
this will have consequences . " schumacher 's german doctors have ordered him to rest for up to three months while his injuries heal .
that could mean that schumacher will miss the rest of the formula one season , which ends in sao paulo on oct .
24 . getting back on the track formula one legend niki lauda , who survived one of the most horrific crashes in the sport 's history , told bild that the longer it takes schumacher to get back into the cockpit , the harder it will be for him to overcome the fear of racing again . but schumacher said that he wants his body to be strong enough to be able to endure another such crash before he races again , adding that no matter how long it takes , fear wo n't stop his return to the sport .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .

he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .

after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .

the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .

unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2004 new german president calls for courage and change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler , center , is sworn in as president of germany horst köhler , former president of the international monetary fund , was sworn in today as germany 's ninth post-war president .
in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .

charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .

ten days after his car spun out at 330 kph -lrb- 198 mph -rrb- and hit the wall backward at the u.s. grand prix , ralf , the younger brother of ferrari world champion michael schumacher , discovered that he has two spinal fractures . the extent of his injuries did n't become known until schumacher underwent a six-hour long examination by doctors in the western german spa town of bad nauheim .
a scandal , according to germany 's bild zeitung , which reported that the oversight by u.s. doctors could have caused schumacher to become paralyzed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher after his accident at the u.s. grand prix in indianapolis .
u.s. doctors overlooked the extent of schumacher 's injuries .
" i was shocked , " schumacher said in an interview with bild .
" i was examined from head to foot in indianapolis .
i do n't know what the doctors there were doing .
this will have consequences . " schumacher 's german doctors have ordered him to rest for up to three months while his injuries heal .
that could mean that schumacher will miss the rest of the formula one season , which ends in sao paulo on oct .
24 . getting back on the track formula one legend niki lauda , who survived one of the most horrific crashes in the sport 's history , told bild that the longer it takes schumacher to get back into the cockpit , the harder it will be for him to overcome the fear of racing again . but schumacher said that he wants his body to be strong enough to be able to endure another such crash before he races again , adding that no matter how long it takes , fear wo n't stop his return to the sport .
" i narrowly escaped a huge catastrophe , " schumacher told the paper .
" the doctors have told me how lucky i am .
if i were afraid , i 'd quit formula one immediately , i 've earned enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher in better days .
despite speculation that the accident could spell the end of ralf schumacher 's career , his doctor has delivered a positive prognosis .
" after eight to 12 weeks , fractures like that - which are n't uncommon - will heal well , " johannes m. peil said . replacement ordered for this weekend 's french grand prix at magny-cours , williams have confirmed that schumacher will be replaced by spaniard marc gene , the team 's official reserve driver . team chief frank williams said in a statement : " i wish ralf well for a full recovery and i hope to see him back racing before the end of the season .
in the meantime we are fortunate to have a driver of marc 's calibre to fill the void . " it 's not the first time gene has stepped in for schumacher .
last year , schumi ii , as he 's known in germany , missed september 's italian grand prix after suffering a concussion from a crash during testing .
gene finished in fifth place . " it 's a shame that opportunities only come along when one of my colleagues has endured some kind of misadventure , but it is my job to make the best of such circumstances and ensure the team is not compromised by ralf 's absence , " gene said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schumi off to a roaring start the 2004 formula one season picked up where the last one left off - with a victory lap by michael schumacher .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .
he has come under criticism from left-leaning members of german society , particularly from trade unions .
they have argued that the german president should address issues more wide ranging than just economic ones . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , horst köhler will become germany 's ninth postwar president .

swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .

officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .

liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .

stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .
he has come under criticism from left-leaning members of german society , particularly from trade unions .
they have argued that the german president should address issues more wide ranging than just economic ones . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , horst köhler will become germany 's ninth postwar president .

the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .
but the netherlands were presented with fresh hope six minutes later when andrade , stretching to intercept van bronckhorst 's cross from the left sent it spinning over the head of his own goalkeeper for an own goal .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuno gomes celebrates the win euro 2004 host portugal dominated the netherlands on wednesday to secure the country 's place in the final this weekend .
the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .
but the netherlands were presented with fresh hope six minutes later when andrade , stretching to intercept van bronckhorst 's cross from the left sent it spinning over the head of his own goalkeeper for an own goal .
it was a lifeline for the dutch but ultimately one they were unable to grasp . lineups : portugal : ricardo pereira ; ricardo carvalho , jorge andrade , nuno valente , miguel ; luis figo , costinha , deco , nuno maniche -lrb- fernando couto 87th -rrb- , cristiano ronaldo -lrb- armando petit 68th -rrb- ; pauleta -lrb- nuno gomes 75th -rrb- . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; michael reiziger , jaap stam , wilfred bouma -lrb- rafael van der vaart 55th -rrb- , giovanni van bronckhorst ; edgar davids , clarence seedorf , phillip cocu ; marc overmars -lrb- roy makaay 46th -rrb- , ruud van nistelrooy , arjen robben -lrb- pierre van hooijdonk 81st -rrb- . referee : anders frisk , sweden afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the bigger they are , the harder they fall the fall-out from euro 2004 elimination is threatening the reputations and careers of some of the major stars who crashed out with their teams , specifically david beckham and zinedine zidane .

" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .
he has come under criticism from left-leaning members of german society , particularly from trade unions .
they have argued that the german president should address issues more wide ranging than just economic ones . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , horst köhler will become germany 's ninth postwar president .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2004 europe 's mini-states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piece of britain in the south of spain : the rock of gibraltar since its enlargement in may , the eu now spans across large parts of the continent .
but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

well , tell that to the stars of euro 2004 who are facing an ignominious fall from grace in the aftermath of their teams elimination from the european championships .
when a kick of the ball or a bad result can wipe away the memories of awe-inspiring performances , the years spent carving hard won respect and the struggle to maintain flawless reputations then it 's much , much more than a game .
it is past , present and future wrapped up in one very fragile package .
the trials and tribulations currently facing damaged icons such as david beckham and zinedine zidane are evidence of the rapidly spinning carousel of public opinion and taste .
they are indicative of the modern transformation of footballers from athletes to celebrities and a sign of the times where private lives make as many headlines as achievements on the field .
in these days of fashion contracts , promotional duties and marketable qualities , there are many more areas to exploit than just the work carried out on the pitch .
the network which supports the soccer star 's elevation to icon status is one reminiscent of a house of cards , each one a different persona created to enlarge the player beyond his core strength .
one gust of bad publicity can force the whole cultivated image to wobble , one missed penalty can bring it all crashing down .
david beckham is a man who has already seen one house of cards hit by a bulldozer and is facing an even bigger demolition job this time around .
back in 1998 , beckham effigies were burning outside stadiums the length and breadth of the u.k. just days after the impetuous boy wonder of the england world cup team had been sent off against argentina in the quarter-final elimination of his team .
to his considerable credit , beckham weathered that particular storm to ascend to the heights of england captain .
on his way to that summit , his advisors cleverly began building the beckham brand through endorsements and eventually a big-money move to real madrid which sent beckham global .
terrible year begins in spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up , up and away .
beckham 's right foot took england to japan / korea in 2002 .
his leadership took them to euro 2004 .
but then came beckham 's annus horribilis .
madrid were heading to their first trophy-free season in five years , beckham 's temperament and form were suspect , his private life rife with rumors of infidelity .
not the perfect background for leading england to european glory .
surely things could n't get any worse ?
but then they did .
beckham 's below-par performances , lack of focus and fitness , and those two missed penalties turned the limelight into an ugly spotlight which exposed all the blemishes .
captain invincible had been shown up as a fallible human ; the opposite of the image his marketing people had been hanging their products on .
the commercial impact of beckham 's underachievement has already begun .
the far east market , which underpins his commercial value , has turned against him .
" blow it like beckham , " read a front-page headline of singapore 's straits times , along with a photograph of him slumped on the ground after his quarter-final penalty miss .
" in just one season , the world has witnessed the downfall of the game 's most phenomenal brand , " wrote singapore 's sunday times .
" one so ubiquitous in its global attack that it seems such a shame he is now defenseless in defeat , because , with or without his famed right foot , the poor fellow really is n't skilful enough . "
marketing plan over football bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tabloid paper new did not hold back either .
" no-one is more over-hyped than david beckham .
and no-one is more underachieved . "
then former real madrid president lorenzo sanz claimed the signing of beckham had made the team ' unbalanced ' and was done solely for ' marketing ' purposes .
already talks are doing the rounds that real could cut their losses and sell the england captain just one year after he signed for € 37.2 million -lrb- £ 25 million -rrb- .
most recently , the backlash has hit street level .
a photographic portrait of beckham at london 's royal academy of arts had to be removed from display after being defaced by graffiti .
the words " you loosers " was written in indelible red felt pen on the 1.5 meter high picture of beckham in an exhibition of pictures of the world 's greatest living soccer players .
the vandals spelt " loosers " with a double " o " in a possible reference to rebecca loos , the woman who earlier this year claimed she had an affair with the england captain .
time for a new face to dominate the billboards ?
beckham 's fall from grace is as much to do with the need for a replacement icon than anything else .
ironically , it could be his more prolific england team-mate wayne rooney who is courted as the new kid on the commercial block .
beckham 's recent failures have just speeded up the marketing turnover machine which is always looking for the next big thing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world player of the year to scapegoat .
zidane 's downfall , however , seems more mercenary .
beckham may have bored everyone to the point of indifference with his ubiquity but zidane 's only failure is to end his international career on the losing side .
the man whose face was beamed onto l 'arc de triumphe after scoring two goals in france 's 1998 world cup final victory over brazil and who helped les bleus win the european championship two years later is now the country 's scapegoat .
french hero turned french scapegoat few would argue that the french team that capitulated to greece in the quarter-final would not have been there had it not been for zidane 's goals against england and switzerland .
while his performances throughout the tournament were well below par , ten other men also failed in their attempt to retain the title yet it is zidane who is taking the full blame for france 's elimination .
" zidane was practically useless during the first half , " l 'equipe wrote about the defeat by greece .
" can zizou quit the national team after such a lackluster performance ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was then revealed that thierry henry had been plotting to oust the two-time world player of the year from the french squad .
according to le parisien , henry is keen to assume zidane 's role as france 's leading player and wants the team to be built around him , believing the way the team was built to suit the talents of zidane lessened the impact he could make in front of goal .
the paper cites how the player power of henry , robert pires and patrick vieria forced jacques santini to get zidane to play on the left , then the center and , finally , on the right , in the 0-1 defeat by greece so as to please henry and pires .
some people expected more from zidane and have manifested their disappointment in their team in the form of blame which has been placed squarely on his shoulders .
others have allegedly begun to sully the legend for their own gain .
in both cases it proves that memories in soccer are short and achievements quickly fade in the glare of failure . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de portugal in semis after dramatic penalty shoot-out win over england .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .
greece : nikopolidis , seitaridis , kapsis , dellas , fyssas , basinas , katsouranis , zagorakis , vryzas , haristeas , karagounis .
czech republic : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , baros , koller .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live fit & gesund we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live made in germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2004 new german president calls for courage and change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler , center , is sworn in as president of germany horst köhler , former president of the international monetary fund , was sworn in today as germany 's ninth post-war president .
in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .
he has come under criticism from left-leaning members of german society , particularly from trade unions .
they have argued that the german president should address issues more wide ranging than just economic ones . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , horst köhler will become germany 's ninth postwar president .

it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .

but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .
he has come under criticism from left-leaning members of german society , particularly from trade unions .
they have argued that the german president should address issues more wide ranging than just economic ones . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , horst köhler will become germany 's ninth postwar president .

the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .
11 , 2001 , on the united states .
" we thank you today for your great service to our country , " he said .
ceremonial , but influential the presidency , while officially the country 's highest office , is largely ceremonial .
real policy-making power lies with the chancellor .
but beginning with richard von weizsäcker , who held the office from 1984 to 1994 , the president began acquiring something of a moral pulpit , and holders of the office have weighed in on major national issues such as integration of immigrants , nationalism , and the state of the nation 's psyche .
the president also represents germany abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler , 61 , who headed the international monetary fund from 2000 to 2004 , is putting his moral weight behind the push to restart the once-mighty german economic engine .
" can we afford not to care if one of the motors of europe keeps spluttering every more , as some say ?
i do n't think so , " he told parliamentarians .
although once revered throughout the postwar world for its economic vigor , the german economy has been stagnant for more than three years .
it shrank last year for the first time in a decade and has watched unemployment climb every month this year ; germany 's jobless rate is the highest of the 12 countries that have adopted the euro .
while the governing red-green coalition of social democrats and greens has enacted reforms that it hopes will remedy the problems , the measures have met with strong protest from trade unions and the german populace at large , who do not want to see the welfare state dismantled .
the unpopular reforms include loosening labor market rules , lowering income tax rates and cutting some retirement and jobless benefits .
" we need to push forward with the courage of the government initiatives toward renewal and we need the courage of the opposition to make its alternatives completely clear , " köhler said .
" and we also need something else - the ability to form constructive compromises .
economics heavyweight köhler was born in eastern poland in 1943 to a farming family that fled to germany after the war .
he studied economics at the university of tübingen , getting a doctorate in 1977 .
he has held positions in the west german finance ministry and was once deputy for former finance minister theo waigel .
he became head of the german savings bank association in 1993 and held the post until moving to the european bank for reconstruction and development in 1998 .
he took the reins of the imf in 2000 before stepping down in 2004 to run for president .
he is the first german head of state without experience in political office and some have questioned how he will succeed in an environment that is very different from that of the board room .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 portugal beats holland to book ticket to finals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuno gomes celebrates the win euro 2004 host portugal dominated the netherlands on wednesday to secure the country 's place in the final this weekend .
the portuguese beat a disorganized dutch side 2-1 . a virtuoso performance from luis figo ensured portugal will advance to the final of a major soccer tournament for the first time .
the portugal skipper deservedly picked up the man of the match award after brilliantly orchestrating portugal 's best euro 2004 performance so far . " i 'm happy with this performance and of course i 'm happy for the country to be in the final , " figo said .
" i thing portugal has fantastic players , young players , and the country has to be happy for the future because we have all the conditions to continue to have a great team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a first-half header from teen star cristiano ronaldo and a stunning strike by midfielder maniche just before the hour mark secured the victory .
but it was a freak own goal by centre-back jorge andrade ensured the home supporters had to endure a nerve-tingling semi-final against holland . but the dutch , run to the point of exhaustion by portugal 's slick passing , never seriously threatened to delay the start of one of the biggest nights of celebrations in lisbon 's history .
it was symptomatic of the hosts ' superiority that their opening goal came mid-way through a first half in which , unshackled by nerves , they might easily have put the game out of their opponents ' reach . deco provided the first declaration of attacking intent with a 6th minute chip towards the head of pauleta that almost caught out dutch keeper edwinvan der sar when it flew clean over the head of portugal 's lone striker .
but it was the forward thrusts of cristiano ronaldo and figo which were doing most to unsettle the dutch . twice in the period of sustained pressure which preceded the goal , figo broke clear of their backline in exhilarating fashion and whipped in dangerous low crosses that , first ronaldo and then pauleta , were frustratingly close to meeting . figo deserves goal a goal for figo would have been fitting but it was his heir-apparent ronaldo who was to provide both the foundations and the finish .
michael reiziger did well to halt the manchester united winger 's advance into the dutch box with a well-timed tackle .
but he promptly blotted his record by failing to cut out the resulting corner from deco .
unchallenged , ronaldo was able to head past van der sar from the edge of the six-yard box . philip cocu 's hopeful long range effort had been the netherlands ' solitary attempt on goal up until that point but the flurry of activity that followed the goal almost produced an equalizer .
but portugal quickly re-established their dominance . a neat one-two with deco sent maniche clear on the right of the dutch box .
the midfielder did his job with an early low cross to the near post but pauleta failed to do his , pushing a mishit shot straight at van der sar . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruud van nistelrooy of the netherlands , left , watches as portuguese goalkeeper ricardo fails to save a goal scored by his own defender jorge andrade .
ruud van nistelrooy thought he had scored his fifth goal of the tournament in the 39th minute but his low drive from just inside the area was chalked off for offside .
" it 's unbelievable how the referee ruled everything in favor of portugal .
he was a real home whistler , " said the frustrated van nistelrooy .
" the referee gave them the benefit of the doubt .
every 50-50 situation was for them .
we can not do anything about it . " portugal the countered and finally got the second goal their efforts deserved .
after picking up a short corner from ronaldo just outside the corner of the dutch box , maniche unleashed an angled left-foot drive that dipped over van der sar and into the net off the far post . given what had gone before , the portuguese fans could have been forgiven for thinking that was game over .
but the netherlands were presented with fresh hope six minutes later when andrade , stretching to intercept van bronckhorst 's cross from the left sent it spinning over the head of his own goalkeeper for an own goal .
it was a lifeline for the dutch but ultimately one they were unable to grasp . lineups : portugal : ricardo pereira ; ricardo carvalho , jorge andrade , nuno valente , miguel ; luis figo , costinha , deco , nuno maniche -lrb- fernando couto 87th -rrb- , cristiano ronaldo -lrb- armando petit 68th -rrb- ; pauleta -lrb- nuno gomes 75th -rrb- . netherlands : edwin van der sar ; michael reiziger , jaap stam , wilfred bouma -lrb- rafael van der vaart 55th -rrb- , giovanni van bronckhorst ; edgar davids , clarence seedorf , phillip cocu ; marc overmars -lrb- roy makaay 46th -rrb- , ruud van nistelrooy , arjen robben -lrb- pierre van hooijdonk 81st -rrb- . referee : anders frisk , sweden afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the bigger they are , the harder they fall the fall-out from euro 2004 elimination is threatening the reputations and careers of some of the major stars who crashed out with their teams , specifically david beckham and zinedine zidane .

the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .

the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .

the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

municipalities will receive federal funds to help pay for the reform . the new law , known as hartz iv , will take effect on jan .
1 after a mediation committee consisting of members of both houses of the german parliament agreed on a compromise . the reforms affect about 1.6 million germans who have been unemployed for more than a year as well as about 1 million people who are currently receiving social welfare payments because they can not work . until now , long-term unemployed have received a larger sum of money and had to pay for their own housing .
now , single people will receive only about € 345 -lrb- $ 420 -rrb- per month while municipalities will take over paying rent . the change is central to the government 's labor market reforms , which are intended to reduce germany 's rampant unemployment .
currently , about 4.2 million people are unemployed in the country . under the new law , long-term unemployed will now have to accept almost any job they are offered and agree to move across the country if necessary or risk losing some or all of their financial aid from the state . billions for municipalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 're in deep water " : holding up town signs , many mayors all over germany jumped into swimming pools last year to alert people to their cities ' financial problems .
government and opposition leaders finally hammered out a compromise wednesday night after agreeing to increase transfer payments to municipalities to help them deal with the extra costs of paying for housing .
while the government had originally offered € 2.56 billion , local authorities will now receive € 3.2 billion . " the tug-of-war is over , now the work starts , " german labor minister wolfgang clement said . opposition politicians including roland koch , the christian democratic premier from the central state of hesse , said that the agreement was acceptable . " it was better to reach a compromise than letting the bill fail , " he said , adding that he also welcomed a pilot project that allows 69 counties and cities to take over the handling of long-term unemployed completely . koch said christian democrats were convinced that local governments could do a much better job than germany 's federal labor office . but critics of the change said that they expected chaos come january as neither the labor office nor municipalities would have enough time to prepare . " this is going to become a catastrophe just like the toll disaster , " hermann-josef arentz , head of the christian democrats ' social welfare committee , told bavarian public broadcaster br , referring to germany 's planned truck toll system , which was supposed to go into operation almost a year ago . both houses of parliament are expected to finally approve the compromise legislation next week . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .

ten days after his car spun out at 330 kph -lrb- 198 mph -rrb- and hit the wall backward at the u.s. grand prix , ralf , the younger brother of ferrari world champion michael schumacher , discovered that he has two spinal fractures . the extent of his injuries did n't become known until schumacher underwent a six-hour long examination by doctors in the western german spa town of bad nauheim .
a scandal , according to germany 's bild zeitung , which reported that the oversight by u.s. doctors could have caused schumacher to become paralyzed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf schumacher after his accident at the u.s. grand prix in indianapolis .
u.s. doctors overlooked the extent of schumacher 's injuries .
" i was shocked , " schumacher said in an interview with bild .
" i was examined from head to foot in indianapolis .
i do n't know what the doctors there were doing .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .
greece : nikopolidis , seitaridis , kapsis , dellas , fyssas , basinas , katsouranis , zagorakis , vryzas , haristeas , karagounis .
czech republic : cech , grygera , ujfalusi , bolf , jankulovski , poborsky , galasek , rosicky , nedved , baros , koller .

" it was better to reach a compromise than letting the bill fail , " he said , adding that he also welcomed a pilot project that allows 69 counties and cities to take over the handling of long-term unemployed completely . koch said christian democrats were convinced that local governments could do a much better job than germany 's federal labor office . but critics of the change said that they expected chaos come january as neither the labor office nor municipalities would have enough time to prepare . " this is going to become a catastrophe just like the toll disaster , " hermann-josef arentz , head of the christian democrats ' social welfare committee , told bavarian public broadcaster br , referring to germany 's planned truck toll system , which was supposed to go into operation almost a year ago . both houses of parliament are expected to finally approve the compromise legislation next week . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

government and opposition leaders finally hammered out a compromise wednesday night after agreeing to increase transfer payments to municipalities to help them deal with the extra costs of paying for housing .
while the government had originally offered € 2.56 billion , local authorities will now receive € 3.2 billion . " the tug-of-war is over , now the work starts , " german labor minister wolfgang clement said . opposition politicians including roland koch , the christian democratic premier from the central state of hesse , said that the agreement was acceptable . " it was better to reach a compromise than letting the bill fail , " he said , adding that he also welcomed a pilot project that allows 69 counties and cities to take over the handling of long-term unemployed completely . koch said christian democrats were convinced that local governments could do a much better job than germany 's federal labor office . but critics of the change said that they expected chaos come january as neither the labor office nor municipalities would have enough time to prepare . " this is going to become a catastrophe just like the toll disaster , " hermann-josef arentz , head of the christian democrats ' social welfare committee , told bavarian public broadcaster br , referring to germany 's planned truck toll system , which was supposed to go into operation almost a year ago . both houses of parliament are expected to finally approve the compromise legislation next week . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de powerful union accuses schröder of ' failure ' as once strong relations between germany 's unions and the ruling social democrats plunge to new lows , one of the labor movement 's most-powerful leaders threatens to withdraw his support for chancellor gerhard schröder .

in a speech before parliament , he called for a renewed drive toward economic renewal . during his speech at the reichstag , in front of both the upper and lower houses of parliament , köhler asked german leaders to " show courage " in continuing the unpopular program of reforms that aims to revive a sputtering national economy .
" we can not afford to lose a single year in the renewal of germany , " köhler said during the speech held after he took the oath of office .
" should we not care whether our county grows and prospers or falls further behind the global competition ? "
" we 're all sitting in the boat , " he said to sustained applause .
köhler , a member of the conservative christian democratic union party , follows johannes rau , who has stepped down after five years in office .
the 61-year-old economist began his speech by thanking rau for his guidance during events such as eu enlargement , globalization and the attacks on sept .

king ludwig ii , often called mad king ludwig , built more than his share of castles , and some of bavaria 's most famous ones .
but why ?
a german psychologist thinks he had the answer : compulsive palace-building syndrome . some people simply have that itch that ca n't be scratched .
some wash their hands repeatedly ; others are constantly checking if the stove 's turned off ; or they eat lunch at precisely the same time every day .
fewer feel compelled to build huge palaces over and over again .
but ludwig did .
he squandered a royal fortune due to a particular form of megalomania , according to professor heinz häfner , founder of the central institute for mental health in mannheim , a compulsion to build castle after castle after castle .
he came to this conclusion upon studying the secret archives of prince franz of bavaria , a descendant of king ludwig .
his findings about the mental state of this controversial 19th century figure will be published in the proceedings of heidelberg academy of sciences .
king ludwig was instrumental in bringing bavaria into a unified germany , but he is most remembered for his fairy tale-like neuschwanstein castle , the inspiration for many a disney film .
there were other castles : herrenchiemsee , with a hall of mirrors longer than that at versailles ; linderhof , with its artificial grotto over a lake ; as well as nymphenburg and hohenschwangau .
in the end , the expense of building them wrecked bavaria financially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his problems , the king is still loved in bavaria .
the professor says the misunderstood king , who was diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic by government ministers who were eager to oust him , suffered from an addiction like gambling or kleptomania .
the king would get a craving to build , turn all restless and excited , and could only be calmed by drawing up plans and visiting the construction site .
after a period of satisfaction , the cycle would start all over again .
the king allegedly committed suicide in 1886 , drowning in the starnberg lake near munich , although many a conspiracy theory about murder exists .
according to professor häfner , the king was lucid until his death , perhaps already dreaming up plans for the next gargantuan building project , or maybe resigned to death since he likely realized since the cash had run out , his building days had come to an end . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

but a few tiny white spots remain on the map : miniature states and territories , most of which have remained independent for centuries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. jean de easelles church in andorra .
swiss author max frisch 's book andorra brought some fame to the mountain principality that 's tucked between france and spain .
but unless they 're avid skiers , most people rarely think of the country .
until 1993 , when parliamentary democracy was introduced , andorrans were ruled by so-called co-princes for 715 years .
the co-princes , the french president and the bishop of the spanish town of la seu d 'urgell , stayed on as titular heads of state .
france and spain also guarantee andorra 's defense with their militaries .
the country is about two-and-a-half times as big as washington , d.c. it is not a member of the eu , but a customs union exists with the bloc , enabling andorrans to export their industrial goods without paying tariffs .
that 's of little significance , however , as 80 percent of andorra 's gross domestic product comes from tourism .
the country is also known as a tax haven and has introduced the euro as its official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical faroe islands scene : the town of hellur faroe means " sheep islands " in the islands ' faroese language and there 's a good reason for that : the archipelago 's 70,000 four-legged wool producers outnumber the 47,000 human inhabitants by far .
the 18 islands , which are roughly eight times as large as the u.s. capital , belong to denmark and the mother country influence 's the political process through a high commissioner .
since 1948 , the islands have actually been a self-governing territory and have control over natural resources .
the danish crown is still the official currency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gibraltarians celebrate the outcome of the 2002 referendum , in which a majority opted to stay with britain .
gibraltar is pretty much a large rock that 's about 11 times as big in area as the mall in washington , d.c. about 30,000 people live on the hotly contested peninsula at the southern end of spain .
officially , gibraltar is an autonomous british territory , but spain has long wanted to take back the piece of land it lost in 1713 .
in 2002 , spain and britain tried to resolve the dispute by proposed a joint rule .
gibraltarians whoever rejected that plan as a majority still wants to stay british .
gibraltar belongs to the eu , but like britain has not adopted the euro as its currency and still sticks to the pound . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isle of man britain is also the main supplier of goods for the isle of man and the channel islands , but both have largely kept their independence : neither officially belongs to the united kingdom nor the eu .
the isle of man , which is about three times the size of washington , d.c. and is located in the irish sea between great britain and ireland , is known as a tax haven .
the island 's 74,700 inhabitants have their own constitution and parliament .
also autonomous , the channel islands , which include guernsey and jersey , comprise an area slightly bigger than the u.s. capital .
many of the islands ' 155,000 inhabitants make a living in the tourist industry .
during world war ii , the islands became the only british terrority occupied by german forces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elderly woman buying fish at kaliningrad market since the eu enlargement that took place on may 1 , the russian enclave kaliningrad is surrounded by the bloc : poland to the west and lithuania to the east .
the region on the baltic sea that 's about half as big as belgium is one of russia 's problem children and considered to be extremely poor .
both moscow and the eu are trying to prevent further isolation of kaliningrad and support it financially .
but travelling to russia has become a major hassle for the region 's one million inhabitants as the eu requires them to obtain transit visas for the trip . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the steeple of the church in the liechtenstein village of triesenberg is seen in front of a sea of fog .
the alvierkette mountain chain in the swiss alps is in the background .
liechtenstein is synonymous with money and that 's not just because the alpine country lies right next to switzerland , with austria bordering to the east .
the principality with 33,400 inhabitants is almost as big as washington , d.c. and is known as a tax haven and has battled with accusations of being used as a place for money laundering .
the country remains independent and does not belong to the eu , just like its larger neighbor , with whom it has a customs union .
liechtenstein also continues to use swiss francs as the official currency .
liechtenstein 's royal family claims restitution for 1,600 sq km of land in the czech republic confiscated in 1918 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monaco casinos and formula 1 car races are what monaco is known for - apart from a royal family that 's been filling european yellow press pages for years .
the principality is located on the mediterranean coastline and surrounded by france , the latter being responsible for monaco 's defense .
the state , about three times as big as the mall in washington , has been independent since 1419 , when the french king guaranteed monaco 's autonomy in a letter .
while not a member of the eu , monaco has introduced the euro as the official currency .
it 's another european tax haven and many of its 32,270 residents are millionaires . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's michael schumacher is a regular visitor to san marino 's annual grand prix of san marino .
he won the formula 1 race this year .
stamp and coin collectors have obviously heard about san marino as the enclave in the north of italy is known for its valuable collector editions : while the country - about a third of washington in size - is not a member of the eu , it has adopted the euro and minted its own coins , which rose in price immediately .
largely dependent on italy economically , san marino has been an independent nation since the year 301 and lies claim to the world 's oldest constitution from 1600 .
about 28,500 people live there .
the two heads of state are always elected for a six-month period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john pope ii is framed by a vatican swiss guard during mass .
vatican city in rome is europe 's smallest state and about 0.7 times as big as the mall in washington .
pope john paul ii works and lives here and serves as head of state as the head of the catholic church .
formally , vatican city and the holy see are two different entities : while the former refers to the physical state , the latter is a non-geographical sovereign entity and participates in many international organizations such as the u.n. as an observer .
neither vatican city nor the holy see are eu members , but the euro is used there .
italy is in charge of defending the city state , but the pope also has his own personal guard , the swiss guards , which belong to vatican city 's 921 inhabitants .
only cardinals under the age of 80 are allowed to elect the pope as head of state , however . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe click here to read dw-world 's special coverage of the eu enlargement .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .

municipalities will receive federal funds to help pay for the reform . the new law , known as hartz iv , will take effect on jan .
1 after a mediation committee consisting of members of both houses of the german parliament agreed on a compromise . the reforms affect about 1.6 million germans who have been unemployed for more than a year as well as about 1 million people who are currently receiving social welfare payments because they can not work . until now , long-term unemployed have received a larger sum of money and had to pay for their own housing .
now , single people will receive only about € 345 -lrb- $ 420 -rrb- per month while municipalities will take over paying rent . the change is central to the government 's labor market reforms , which are intended to reduce germany 's rampant unemployment .
currently , about 4.2 million people are unemployed in the country . under the new law , long-term unemployed will now have to accept almost any job they are offered and agree to move across the country if necessary or risk losing some or all of their financial aid from the state . billions for municipalities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we 're in deep water " : holding up town signs , many mayors all over germany jumped into swimming pools last year to alert people to their cities ' financial problems .
government and opposition leaders finally hammered out a compromise wednesday night after agreeing to increase transfer payments to municipalities to help them deal with the extra costs of paying for housing .
while the government had originally offered € 2.56 billion , local authorities will now receive € 3.2 billion .

dutch advance after topping swedes in penalties greek davids ' slay the french goliaths czechs crush danes to make semis world cup 2006 -pipe- 01.07.2004 greece in final after sensational victory over czechs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blue and white army are in portugal for the duration greece will play portugal in the final of euro 2004 after beating the czechs by a silver goal in the second semi-final in the estadio do dragao in porto on thursday night . greece completed an incredible line-up for the final of the 2004 european championships by beating the czech republic 1-0 in porto .
the victory sets up a mouth-watering repeat of the first game of the championships with the host nation portugal facing their opening game nemesis in lisbon on sunday with the henri delauney trophy up for grabs .
neither the windy conditions in the estadio do dragao or the rumors of discontent blowing from the greek camp could spoil the celebration of soccer for the 50,000-strong crowd as both sets of supporters combined to rival the previous night 's noise as the home nation beat holland in the first semi-final .
both teams also looked to rival the spectacle of wednesday 's match in terms of pace and passion .
the greeks aimed to do their bit by attacking from the off , acutely aware of the danger an early czech goal could do .
and that nearly came in the second minute when rosicky rattled the greek crossbar with a vicious volley from the edge of the box as the czechs quickly showed their own intent .
swarming attacks force greeks back the frame of the goal was not the only thing shaken .
the greeks early offensive plan soon reverted to enforced defense as the czechs swarmed forward in wave after wave .
another chance fell to marek jankulovski on five minutes .
his thundering shot was goal bound but for the strong fists of nikopolidis who beat the effort to safety .
composure soon returned to the greeks as they began to put together some well-drilled passing moves in an attempt to threaten petr cech 's goal .
but with the holding czech midfielder tomas galasek a hive of workman-like industry in front of the defense , the greeks were left to bypass the center third of the pitch with high balls ; a plan that played into the hands of their opponents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller gave the greeks plenty of problems in the opening 20 minutes .
traianos dellas was having a busy time of things at the other end , coping with jan koller .
the dortmund striker was the next to wobble the woodwork when he got the better of the greek center-half with a looping header on 19 minutes that bounced off the crossbar into the waiting hands of goalkeeper nikopolidis .
dellas soon passed the giant-watching duties to his defensive partner michalis kapsis . profligate czechs see chances go begging for all their possession in the first 25 minutes , the czechs ' final ball was uncharacteristically wasteful .
too often the sublime movement and slick passing ended with a lazy pass or a crossing of wires .
so when zizis vryzas almost hooked the ball around cech after racing into the opposite penalty area , czech profligacy in front of the greek goal took on an ominous tone .
again , the next culprit to squander a good chance was jankulovski on the half-hour mark .
after poborsky had raced clear and crossed to nedved , who went down clutching his shin , the czech defender found himself in a similar position as before .
and once more , nikopolidis was equal to his powerful shot .
nedved out , not by card but by injury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , fearing a yellow card may rule him out of the final , hobbled out of the game injured .
the gods looked to be playing their part on 40 minutes .
with five minutes to go in the first half , the greek tactics were forcing star striker milan baros into a left-back role and pavel nedved was limping off to be replaced by vlad smicer .
the tide appeared to be turning .
the non-appearance of the goal rush the czechs expected looked to be playing on the minds of their forwards .
once more it was left to defender jankulovski to provide the czech republic with their next effort on goal .
the rampaging number six tried his luck from distance this time and rippled the roof of the net without really worrying the greek keeper .
first 45 minutes end with greece settled at half-time , the greeks looked good value for the goal-less score line .
after weathering the initial storm , otto rehhagel 's team had begun to exert a subtle control on proceedings .
karel brückner 's men , on the other hand , went into the break wondering if their wasted chances would come back to haunt them .
the czechs opened the second half by applying moderate pressure but greece looked the more refreshed and creative although neither team penetrated into the opposition 's final third with any real danger in the opening exchanges .
what first looked to be the beginnings of a free-flowing attacking showpiece soon started to degenerate into a diving contest .
baros was spending more time on the floor than on his feet and many of his team mates were equally happy to go to ground in an attempt to win free-kicks when challenged .
the greeks were equally theatrical in the tackle as the rhythm of the game began to stutter .
speculative efforts increase as clock ticks the first real chance of the half came on the hour .
poborsky 's curling corner went all the way to the back post where koller out-jumped everyone , only to power his header into the back of milan baros and out for a goal kick with the keeper stranded a good few meters away .
minutes later , rosicky had the next opportunity after cleverly making space for himself on the edge of the penalty area but his shot flew high and wide .
the first greek chance of the seciond period soon came .
a high cross was flapped at by cech as he jumped with basinas but the trajectory had been changed enough to foil fyssas who arrived late and directed his own header wide of the mark .
greece had a clearer chance just a minute later .
karagounis drifted across the static czech defense and rifled in a shot that cech did well to save .
final beckons but chances fly wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller could have sealed the game with a glorious chance in the final ten minutes .
as the clock ticked on into the last ten minutes of normal time , jan koller had the best chance of the game .
after a double-pass with dortmund team mate tomas rosicky opened up the greek defense , koller struck his first time shot from ten meters out only to see his perfectly hit effort fly inches past the post with nikopolidis beaten .
then it was the turn of baros .
twisting this way then that , the tournament 's leading scorer teased the back-tracking defense before curling a deceptive shot round the crowd of players and just past the upright with five of the 90 minutes left to play .
when collina blew for full-time , it was the czech republic who knew that the main chances to win the game had been theirs .
for the greeks , they had at least 15 more minutes to carve out their own victory after surviving through their opponents inability to take chances .
the first period of extra-time nearly produced the first goal .
cech came out of his goal to deal with a high ball inot the area only for giannakopoulous to beat him to the ball .
his header looped over the goalie towards an empty net only to be cleared at the last minute by a retreating defender .
greece then had two very good chances to score .
charisteas was caught offside when it looked clear that the bremen striker would score and then giannakopoulous again threatened from close range .
the frenzied goal activity increased at both ends as the teams went all out to win the game before the possibility of agonizing penalty elimination became a reality .
dellas then had a glorious chance as he ran onto a high through ball which caught the czech defense out .
his glancing header was not far enough wide of cech who spread himself to turn the ball away from danger .
the greek defender then made history with his next header .
in the final minute of the first half of extra-time , dellas charged inot the packed area to direct the winning goal past cech and send greece into the final of euro 2004 .
the silver goal was the last action of the game but there was still much activity on the pitch as the greeks were sent into rapture .
the tournament had gone full circle .
the first game will now be the last as the hosts take on their first opponents in the final .
it 's portugal versus greece part ii .
greece : nikopolidis , seitaridis , kapsis , dellas , fyssas , basinas , katsouranis , zagorakis , vryzas , haristeas , karagounis .

dr michael kabesch and colleagues at children 's university hospital , in munich , looked at 3,000 schoolchildren .
those with smoking parents and defects in a gene whose product is responsible for detoxifying smoke from the body were more likely to be asthmatic than other children .
the findings appear in the journal thorax .
the gene they looked at makes a protein called glutathione s transferase , or gst . "
second hand smoke is a serious health hazard for children , however this study suggests that some children may be at greater risk due to their genetic make-up " matthew hallsworth , asthma uk one of gst 's jobs is to rid the body of toxins made when we breathe in cigarette smoke .
dr kabesh 's team found that among children with a specific defect to the gst gene , those whose parents were active smokers were more likely to have respiratory problems than children whose parents did not smoke .
they were five times more likely to have asthma , five times more likely to wheeze and nine times more likely to be short of breath .
risky genes children with another mutation to the gst gene had similar passive-smoking-related lung problems .
those whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy had worse lung function than children with the genetic mutation whose mothers had not smoked .
dr kabesh and colleagues said : " while environmental tobacco smoke exposure is a serious health hazard for children , some are even more susceptible to developing asthma and severe asthma symptoms when exposed to passive smoking . "
matthew hallsworth , research development manager at asthma uk , said : " there is already a great deal of evidence to show that second-hand smoke is a serious health hazard for children , however this study suggests that some children may be at greater risk due to their genetic make-up .
" the enzyme gst has been linked to childhood asthma and allergies in previous studies .
this new research shows that defects in the gene for this enzyme may be associated with the development of asthma and wheezing in children when exposed to second-hand smoke or maternal smoking during pregnancy .
" important findings such as these should help us to begin to unravel the complex jigsaw of interactions between our genes and factors in the environment that can lead to the development of asthma . "

dr michael kabesch and colleagues at children 's university hospital , in munich , looked at 3,000 schoolchildren .
those with smoking parents and defects in a gene whose product is responsible for detoxifying smoke from the body were more likely to be asthmatic than other children .
the findings appear in the journal thorax .
the gene they looked at makes a protein called glutathione s transferase , or gst .
second hand smoke is a serious health hazard for children , however this study suggests that some children may be at greater risk due to their genetic make-up matthew hallsworth , asthma uk one of gst 's jobs is to rid the body of toxins made when we breathe in cigarette smoke .
dr kabesh 's team found that among children with a specific defect to the gst gene , those whose parents were active smokers were more likely to have respiratory problems than children whose parents did not smoke .
they were five times more likely to have asthma , five times more likely to wheeze and nine times more likely to be short of breath .
risky genes children with another mutation to the gst gene had similar passive-smoking-related lung problems .
those whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy had worse lung function than children with the genetic mutation whose mothers had not smoked .
dr kabesh and colleagues said : " while environmental tobacco smoke exposure is a serious health hazard for children , some are even more susceptible to developing asthma and severe asthma symptoms when exposed to passive smoking . "
matthew hallsworth , research development manager at asthma uk , said : " there is already a great deal of evidence to show that second-hand smoke is a serious health hazard for children , however this study suggests that some children may be at greater risk due to their genetic make-up .

the chairman of the north atlantic salmon fund -lrb- nasf -rrb- , orri vigfusson , claims there is still an acute need to protect wild stocks .
he is calling for a ban on interceptory netting in scotland which kills salmon destined for lochs and rivers .
the nasf has campaigned for the scottish executive to preserve salmon before the species is wiped out .
ongoing campaign mr vigfusson said : " it is the duty of the scottish executive to support wild salmon , but they are failing to do so .
" the nasf has raised £ 20m to date to protect salmon originating in scotland and elsewhere - including £ 3.5m to support the buy-out of the north-east drift net fisheries in england - but the scottish executive did not support that buy-out .
" our campaign must go on . "
an executive spokesman said it did support the conservation of wild salmon stocks and their contribution to the scottish economy .
he added : " drift netting was prohibited in scotland in 1962 and the ban remains in force . "
under pressure scottish farmed salmon has also come under pressure in recent months .
a study in january warned that british farmed salmon was so full of pollutant chemicals that it should be eaten only sparingly , a claim dismissed by industry body scottish quality salmon .
the uk 's food watchdog last week issued guidance on the amount of oily fish such as salmon which people should be eating .
the fsa said there were health benefits associated with salmon , including the potential to reduce heart disease .
however , concerns have been raised about chemicals in farmed salmon .
the fsa said its recommendations were aimed at striking the right balance based on the evidence available .

the chairman of the north atlantic salmon fund -lrb- nasf -rrb- , orri vigfusson , claims there is still an acute need to protect wild stocks .
he is calling for a ban on interceptory netting in scotland which kills salmon destined for lochs and rivers .
the nasf has campaigned for the scottish executive to preserve salmon before the species is wiped out .
ongoing campaign mr vigfusson said : " it is the duty of the scottish executive to support wild salmon , but they are failing to do so .
" the nasf has raised £ 20m to date to protect salmon originating in scotland and elsewhere - including £ 3.5m to support the buy-out of the north-east drift net fisheries in england - but the scottish executive did not support that buy-out .
" our campaign must go on . "
an executive spokesman said it did support the conservation of wild salmon stocks and their contribution to the scottish economy .
he added : " drift netting was prohibited in scotland in 1962 and the ban remains in force . "
under pressure scottish farmed salmon has also come under pressure in recent months .
a study in january warned that british farmed salmon was so full of pollutant chemicals that it should be eaten only sparingly , a claim dismissed by industry body scottish quality salmon .
the uk 's food watchdog last week issued guidance on the amount of oily fish such as salmon which people should be eating .
the fsa said there were health benefits associated with salmon , including the potential to reduce heart disease .
however , concerns have been raised about chemicals in farmed salmon .
the fsa said its recommendations were aimed at striking the right balance based on the evidence available .

in every recent testimony before congress and in every speech to bankers , he has indicated that the time was right for a " measured " tightening of monetary policy .
so the announcement surprised no-one .
nor was there any shock in the language in the accompanying statement - which is the way it 's meant to be .
governors of central banks are n't supposed to go round surprising financial markets .
in the statement , the federal reserve said that interest rates would rise " at a pace that is likely to be measured " .
if mr greenspan manages to snuff out incipient inflation without halting growth , his place of honour will be secure though , it added the rider that it would " respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfil its obligation to maintain price stability " .
in other words , it does n't think inflation is about to resurface but if it does , the rises will be by a half point not a quarter point - and they 'll happen more frequently .
balancing act at the heart of the fed 's decision is the belief that recent rises in prices have been one-off and may well be reversed -lrb- as is happening with oil -rrb- and not part of a general process of price rises .
as the statement put it : " a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors . "
that may or may not turn out to be true .
there is some evidence , though , that inflationary pressures remain relatively low .
growth is steady and companies are making profits - but they 're not yet confident enough to take on large numbers of workers .
productivity is rising quickly .
the question now is whether rising rates will cool down the hotter parts of the economy without choking off general growth .
higher interest rates ought to slow consumer spending but all the signs are that optimism is returning and that may take some denting .
and the housing market is so feverish that price rises will take some stopping .
miracle or mirage ?
if mr greenspan manages to snuff out incipient inflation without halting growth , his place of honour will be secure .
under his chairmanship , the federal reserve would have successfully cut rates to their lowest since 1958 , bringing strong growth both in the late 1990s after the stock market crash and then again after september 11 , 2001 .
he would then have managed to put rates back up again to keep the growth going without inflation .
but if employment starts taking off , and inflation turns out to be more ingrained than the fed seems to think - and if it has to raise interest rates at a faster pace - then critics will ask if the great prosperity under mr greenspan had quite as much to do with his magic touch as his many fans think .

in the statement , the federal reserve said that interest rates would rise " at a pace that is likely to be measured " .
if mr greenspan manages to snuff out incipient inflation without halting growth , his place of honour will be secure though , it added the rider that it would " respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfil its obligation to maintain price stability " .

if mr greenspan manages to snuff out incipient inflation without halting growth , his place of honour will be secure .
under his chairmanship , the federal reserve would have successfully cut rates to their lowest since 1958 , bringing strong growth both in the late 1990s after the stock market crash and then again after september 11 , 2001 .
he would then have managed to put rates back up again to keep the growth going without inflation .
but if employment starts taking off , and inflation turns out to be more ingrained than the fed seems to think - and if it has to raise interest rates at a faster pace - then critics will ask if the great prosperity under mr greenspan had quite as much to do with his magic touch as his many fans think .

why has he gone and where does it leave the uk supermarket giant ?
bbc news online explains .
why did he go ?
sir peter davis has been forced out in the latest show of muscle by big institutional shareholders .
the final straw for city investors was a £ 2.4m bonus awarded for last year .
their anger was not so much over the size of the bonus as that it came at a time when sir peter was overseeing falls in the company 's profits , share price and market share .
does this draw a line under sainsbury 's problems ?
not yet .
sir peter 's resignation has been accompanied by a warning that profits in 2004/05 will be significantly below analyst forecasts .
the recently-installed chief executive justin king will be under severe pressure to start improving the store chain 's operating performance .
on the plus side for him , mr king will now have a free hand to devise and drive strategy without former chief executive sir peter looking down from the chairman 's office .
what 's mr king 's plan ?
he has already begun to overturn some of sir peter 's policies , for example by cutting prices .
this will inevitably lower the store 's profit margin but many analysts view it as an essential move if sainsbury 's is to compete again in a meaningful way with tesco and asda .
in the longer term , mr king will have to overhaul sainsbury 's supply chain .
an acceptance of slimmer margins should mean a drive to greater efficiency and increased sales volumes .
there is also the matter of sir peter 's bonus to resolve .
sainsbury 's statement refers to " possible amendments " to the award but says it was not possible to reach agreement with him .
a battle between both sides ' lawyers is now in prospect .
but was n't sir peter supposed to be the saviour of sainsbury 's ?
he was .
" the man from the pru " was appointed to great fanfare .
he promised to reinvigorate sainsbury 's both for customers and workers .
but , after four years , he has failed .
sainsbury 's has been overtaken for market share by price-conscious asda , is under pressure from the newly-combined morrison / safeway , beaten for quality by waitrose and m & s and beaten out of sight on price and quality by market leader tesco .
what happens now ?
sainsbury 's has acted quickly by immediately appointing philip hampton to succeed sir peter .
mr hampton , 50 , is a former finance director of bt , who was highly regarded by shareholders and once thought likely to become chief executive of the telecoms firm .
he was later finance director of lloyds tsb .
with his appointment , sainsbury 's will be hoping finally to have alighted on a chairman that will please shareholders .
the botched appointment of sir ian prosser - picked to succeed sir peter next year but dropped after an investor revolt - had made sainsbury 's look like a company that could do nothing but irritate its shareholders .
and how bad is sainsbury 's business ?
the company is struggling against its competition but it is no basket case .
sainsbury 's still makes an annual profit of £ 670m and has sales north of £ 15bn .
it has become a gaffe-prone company and has appeared leaden-footed compared with tesco .
but it is not a marconi or itv digital .
