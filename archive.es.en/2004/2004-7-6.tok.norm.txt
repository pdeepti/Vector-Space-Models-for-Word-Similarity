pedal boats for the earthbound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " draisine " is the german term for pedal trolley they took a disused but scenic 40-kilometer -lrb- 25-mile -rrb- stretch of railroad track , outfitted it with the terrestrial equivalent of pedal boats , and set up the draisinentour - a change of pace from the typical bike tour , with the possibility to stop and sightsee along the way .
there 's no getting around it : a rail pedal trolley trip is fun , but hard work .
the rail trolley runs on four wheels and is pedaled exactly like a bicycle , but one whose wheels are fixed to the railroad tracks .
there is space on the trolley for up to four people - two can sit on the bicycles , and a bench that spans the tracks can hold up to two more adults or three children .
thunder thighs strong quadriceps are a plus - the trolley is heavy -lrb- plus there 's all that beer - oops , gear - stuck behind the bench .
this could be anything from a picnic lunch to a grill , to some real bikes for side trips , to the ever popular beer keg . -rrb-
on the positive side , since you do n't need to steer , you can give all your attention to the breathtaking landscape , or have a chat with your biking partner , or take a drink - or just sit back on the bench and let one of the other passengers have a turn at the pedals .
breaks encouraged so if you 're stuck fast to the tracks , how do you stop and take time to see the sights ?
the folks at nahe valley tourism have thought of everything .
for picnics , to rest , or for sightseeing stops in nearby towns , there are stopping stations every two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- or so along the route .
-lrb- riders who stop must first remove their trolley from the tracks , so that others can continue on . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not having to steer means you can enjoy the view trolley riders can choose between an overall tour of 20 kilometers or 40 kilometers .
if you 'd rather eat out than bring -lrb- and carry ! -rrb- a picnic , there are small restaurants and inns marked along the route .
the entire route goes from the town of staudernheim , via meisenheim and lauterecken , to altenglan in the palatinate hills , following the meandering glan river , and passing through green meadows , wooded hills and romantic valleys .
the trip also goes through numerous tiny towns and some larger ones as well , with a chance to visit little museums , churches , galleries , and vineyards en route .
reservations required each day the trip goes in one direction or the other , starting on odd-numbered days at lauterecken and even numbered days at staudernheim .
public buses bring you back to your starting point .
while little known outside the region , the trolley tour is becoming more and more popular ; reservations - especially on holidays and weekends - are an absolute necessity .
booking times can be as long as a year in advance .
a day on a trolley costs 35 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- during the week , or 39 euros on weekends and holidays .
it takes two people over 5 feet tall to operate . pia gram -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de biking the iron curtain broke stereotypes for german athlete from norway to greece , frank hülsemann traced 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- of the former iron curtain on his mountain bike .

pedal boats for the earthbound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " draisine " is the german term for pedal trolley they took a disused but scenic 40-kilometer -lrb- 25-mile -rrb- stretch of railroad track , outfitted it with the terrestrial equivalent of pedal boats , and set up the draisinentour - a change of pace from the typical bike tour , with the possibility to stop and sightsee along the way .
there 's no getting around it : a rail pedal trolley trip is fun , but hard work .
the rail trolley runs on four wheels and is pedaled exactly like a bicycle , but one whose wheels are fixed to the railroad tracks .
there is space on the trolley for up to four people - two can sit on the bicycles , and a bench that spans the tracks can hold up to two more adults or three children .
thunder thighs strong quadriceps are a plus - the trolley is heavy -lrb- plus there 's all that beer - oops , gear - stuck behind the bench .
this could be anything from a picnic lunch to a grill , to some real bikes for side trips , to the ever popular beer keg . -rrb-
on the positive side , since you do n't need to steer , you can give all your attention to the breathtaking landscape , or have a chat with your biking partner , or take a drink - or just sit back on the bench and let one of the other passengers have a turn at the pedals .
breaks encouraged so if you 're stuck fast to the tracks , how do you stop and take time to see the sights ?
the folks at nahe valley tourism have thought of everything .
for picnics , to rest , or for sightseeing stops in nearby towns , there are stopping stations every two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- or so along the route .
-lrb- riders who stop must first remove their trolley from the tracks , so that others can continue on . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not having to steer means you can enjoy the view trolley riders can choose between an overall tour of 20 kilometers or 40 kilometers .
if you 'd rather eat out than bring -lrb- and carry ! -rrb- a picnic , there are small restaurants and inns marked along the route .
the entire route goes from the town of staudernheim , via meisenheim and lauterecken , to altenglan in the palatinate hills , following the meandering glan river , and passing through green meadows , wooded hills and romantic valleys .
the trip also goes through numerous tiny towns and some larger ones as well , with a chance to visit little museums , churches , galleries , and vineyards en route .
reservations required each day the trip goes in one direction or the other , starting on odd-numbered days at lauterecken and even numbered days at staudernheim .
public buses bring you back to your starting point .
while little known outside the region , the trolley tour is becoming more and more popular ; reservations - especially on holidays and weekends - are an absolute necessity .
booking times can be as long as a year in advance .
a day on a trolley costs 35 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- during the week , or 39 euros on weekends and holidays .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

until then , both sides say , they will be in constant contact . conflict should be less public klaus uwe benneter , who serves as the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that chancellor gerhard schröder used the meeting to make it clear that he does n't approve of the way the unions are expressing their criticism . according to benneter , schröder called for a less public display of discord and articulated his wish that by the next meeting , both sides would have a common approach to the problems facing them . unions missing opportunity pressure is growing on the unions from industry representatives to abandon their strategy of resistance .

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .
supervie and costagliola believe that only the second wave of infection has been identified while the first one went unreported . first french symptoms ten years after outbreak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the first cases of the deadly disease were spotted in 1980 's britain , the french government was careful to ban imports of infected cows from the neighboring country .
however , the control of its own supplies only began years later , after the first bse symptoms were diagnosed in french bovines in 1991 . up until 1989 , nearly five years after the first bse case in great britain , french farmers were still feeding their livestock british offal ; remnants of the brain and spinal cord of dead animals which were used in animal feed and in which bse remains infectious . farmers still used infected feed so , for over a decade before the first french bse symptoms were noticed , farmers were creating their own outbreak on french soil by using infected animal feed .
it has also been suggested that french herds had been infected a long time before the 1980 's but had gone unidentified due to the lack of knowledge on the disease . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a butcher is preparing beef in front of bse-testet pieces of spinal cord from a cattle in muelheim , germany , on tuesday , nov.14 , 2000 .
beginning next year the bse-test will be officially introduced in germany .
the test detects the mad cow disease , that can cause the creutzfeldt-jacob disease in humans .
the test takes 24 hours .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- the current publication comes at a very unfavorable time for the government in paris .
the french authorities recently announced the death of a 55-year-old man who suffered from the human variant of bse , creutzfeldt jakob 's disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
his death is the seventh cjd fatality registered by french doctors . study suggests cover-up in the report , cosagliola harshly criticizes the french authorities .
" one has known for some time that the official statistics do not reflect the true magnitude of the epidemic , " writes the scientist .
the facts support his claim .
according to official statistics , there were merely 923 cattle infected with bse in france during the last 13 years .
that leaves an estimated 290,000 bse animals unaccounted for in the official records . other evidence shows that the french authorities could have reacted to the potential epidemic at least four years ago .
in a report of the scientific committee of the eu -lrb- ssc -rrb- which appeared in july 2000 , experts warned about the danger of underestimating the numbers of bse cases in france .
according to germany der spiegel magazine which printed extracts of the report at the time , page five of the paper shows that there is " no clear picture about the number of bse cases -lrb- in france -rrb- .

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .
supervie and costagliola believe that only the second wave of infection has been identified while the first one went unreported . first french symptoms ten years after outbreak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the first cases of the deadly disease were spotted in 1980 's britain , the french government was careful to ban imports of infected cows from the neighboring country .
however , the control of its own supplies only began years later , after the first bse symptoms were diagnosed in french bovines in 1991 . up until 1989 , nearly five years after the first bse case in great britain , french farmers were still feeding their livestock british offal ; remnants of the brain and spinal cord of dead animals which were used in animal feed and in which bse remains infectious . farmers still used infected feed so , for over a decade before the first french bse symptoms were noticed , farmers were creating their own outbreak on french soil by using infected animal feed .
it has also been suggested that french herds had been infected a long time before the 1980 's but had gone unidentified due to the lack of knowledge on the disease . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a butcher is preparing beef in front of bse-testet pieces of spinal cord from a cattle in muelheim , germany , on tuesday , nov.14 , 2000 .
beginning next year the bse-test will be officially introduced in germany .
the test detects the mad cow disease , that can cause the creutzfeldt-jacob disease in humans .
the test takes 24 hours .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- the current publication comes at a very unfavorable time for the government in paris .
the french authorities recently announced the death of a 55-year-old man who suffered from the human variant of bse , creutzfeldt jakob 's disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
his death is the seventh cjd fatality registered by french doctors . study suggests cover-up in the report , cosagliola harshly criticizes the french authorities .
" one has known for some time that the official statistics do not reflect the true magnitude of the epidemic , " writes the scientist .
the facts support his claim .
according to official statistics , there were merely 923 cattle infected with bse in france during the last 13 years .
that leaves an estimated 290,000 bse animals unaccounted for in the official records . other evidence shows that the french authorities could have reacted to the potential epidemic at least four years ago .
in a report of the scientific committee of the eu -lrb- ssc -rrb- which appeared in july 2000 , experts warned about the danger of underestimating the numbers of bse cases in france .
according to germany der spiegel magazine which printed extracts of the report at the time , page five of the paper shows that there is " no clear picture about the number of bse cases -lrb- in france -rrb- .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings . " you ca n't win elections with speed limits , but you can lose them , " he said . long , close relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a replica of teh first motorized car by carl benz the country 's relationship with cars and driving is long .
the first successful internal-combustion engine was constructed in germany in 1878 by nikolaus otto .
today germany is home to some of the world 's leading makers of luxury , high-performance cars .
the names mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche have become synonymous with german expertise and play important roles in both the german economy , directly or indirectly employing some 18 percent of the work force , not to mention the national psyche . " when you buy a car in germany , you do n't do it with your brain , you do it because of the feeling , " jochen hövekenmeier , spokesman for the avd automobile club , told dw-world . he and others in the car industry and related fields are strongly against putting a general limit on autobahn speed .
they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions . " we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .
in a june survey commissioned by the newsmagazine stern and carried out by the forsa polling firm , 52 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of autobahn speed limits , while 45 percent rejected the idea . european harmonization but for von weizsäcker , it is time for germany to get in line with its european neighbors , all of which have speed limits on their freeways .
he also pointed out that after the may 1 expansion of the european union , germany lies in its center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on the autobahn the levels of transit traffic from east to west and vice versa is skyrocketing .
a speed limit could help keep traffic moving on the highways , which are almost at capacity . and while he understands that many drivers enamored with high speeds do not want the state to interfere in what he calls their " masculine showing , " he thinks it 's time to discard such ideas and cut the speed . " i believe it 's a reasonable thing , " he said , " a symbol of mature civilization .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings .

today germany is home to some of the world 's leading makers of luxury , high-performance cars .
the names mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche have become synonymous with german expertise and play important roles in both the german economy , directly or indirectly employing some 18 percent of the work force , not to mention the national psyche . " when you buy a car in germany , you do n't do it with your brain , you do it because of the feeling , " jochen hövekenmeier , spokesman for the avd automobile club , told dw-world . he and others in the car industry and related fields are strongly against putting a general limit on autobahn speed .
they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions . " we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .
in a june survey commissioned by the newsmagazine stern and carried out by the forsa polling firm , 52 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of autobahn speed limits , while 45 percent rejected the idea . european harmonization but for von weizsäcker , it is time for germany to get in line with its european neighbors , all of which have speed limits on their freeways .
he also pointed out that after the may 1 expansion of the european union , germany lies in its center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on the autobahn the levels of transit traffic from east to west and vice versa is skyrocketing .
a speed limit could help keep traffic moving on the highways , which are almost at capacity . and while he understands that many drivers enamored with high speeds do not want the state to interfere in what he calls their " masculine showing , " he thinks it 's time to discard such ideas and cut the speed .

the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 and placed on the on the world heritage list in 1996 , is one of germany 's top tourist attractions but its integrity is being threatened by the increasing number of skyscrapers being built and planned for the rhineland city , according to a statement released during the annual meeting of the 21 member world heritage committee in the eastern chinese city of suzhou .

" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
the cathedral , or dom , is the only site in europe to be included on the 32 site list , which is generally considered a source of shame for the countries involved .
birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation at the meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral was endangered , but recognised that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , the statement said . cologne 's christian democrat mayor fritz schramma rejected unesco 's decision on monday .
" it can not be that because a town has a cathedral , it may not develop , " he said .
" of course this must continue and this development will stand in harmony with the cathedral . "

but both sides say they 'll continue to talk . immediately after monday 's meeting , spd national party leader franz müntefering and the head of the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , confirmed that differences of opinion remain on the central points of the spd 's reform plans , known as agenda 2010 .
a point of particular concern for the unions is the spd 's plan to consolidate unemployment and social welfare payments starting in 2005 - a plan the spd says is not up for debate . dgb 's vice-president , ursula engelen-kefer ´ , described the atmosphere during the meeting as " pretty agitated , " adding that such hefty arguments are hardly a " walk in the park .

" there 's no alternative to the course that the government has set since march 2003 , " hans werner busch , head of the employers ' association for the metalworking industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the unions ' choice to go on confrontation course was robbing them of the opportunity to contribute to the reform process , he said . the spd and the unions did agree however , to refuse support to a new grouping of left-wing rebels , who plan to found a party to challenge the spd .
" we made clear that there will be no support in terms of infrastructure for any founding of a new party or similar group , " sommer said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german leftist group emerges unhappy with the german government 's welfare reforms , trade union and social democratic party members have formed a new association that could pose a serious challenge in upcoming elections .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .

while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .

since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings .

" we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .

" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.07.2004 debate over diesel car filters heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : particulate filters -lrb- like the one shown here -rrb- , may soon be required in diesel cars .
german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 .

" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 and placed on the on the world heritage list in 1996 , is one of germany 's top tourist attractions but its integrity is being threatened by the increasing number of skyscrapers being built and planned for the rhineland city , according to a statement released during the annual meeting of the 21 member world heritage committee in the eastern chinese city of suzhou .

the cathedral , or dom , is the only site in europe to be included on the 32 site list , which is generally considered a source of shame for the countries involved .

" it can not be that because a town has a cathedral , it may not develop , " he said .
" of course this must continue and this development will stand in harmony with the cathedral . "

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .

according to official statistics , there were merely 923 cattle infected with bse in france during the last 13 years .
that leaves an estimated 290,000 bse animals unaccounted for in the official records . other evidence shows that the french authorities could have reacted to the potential epidemic at least four years ago .

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .
supervie and costagliola believe that only the second wave of infection has been identified while the first one went unreported . first french symptoms ten years after outbreak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the first cases of the deadly disease were spotted in 1980 's britain , the french government was careful to ban imports of infected cows from the neighboring country .
however , the control of its own supplies only began years later , after the first bse symptoms were diagnosed in french bovines in 1991 . up until 1989 , nearly five years after the first bse case in great britain , french farmers were still feeding their livestock british offal ; remnants of the brain and spinal cord of dead animals which were used in animal feed and in which bse remains infectious . farmers still used infected feed so , for over a decade before the first french bse symptoms were noticed , farmers were creating their own outbreak on french soil by using infected animal feed .
it has also been suggested that french herds had been infected a long time before the 1980 's but had gone unidentified due to the lack of knowledge on the disease . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a butcher is preparing beef in front of bse-testet pieces of spinal cord from a cattle in muelheim , germany , on tuesday , nov.14 , 2000 .
beginning next year the bse-test will be officially introduced in germany .
the test detects the mad cow disease , that can cause the creutzfeldt-jacob disease in humans .
the test takes 24 hours .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- the current publication comes at a very unfavorable time for the government in paris .
the french authorities recently announced the death of a 55-year-old man who suffered from the human variant of bse , creutzfeldt jakob 's disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
his death is the seventh cjd fatality registered by french doctors . study suggests cover-up in the report , cosagliola harshly criticizes the french authorities .
" one has known for some time that the official statistics do not reflect the true magnitude of the epidemic , " writes the scientist .
the facts support his claim .
according to official statistics , there were merely 923 cattle infected with bse in france during the last 13 years .
that leaves an estimated 290,000 bse animals unaccounted for in the official records . other evidence shows that the french authorities could have reacted to the potential epidemic at least four years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

his subject matter already has germany 's conservatives , who find the whole thing too tasteless for words , choking .
it 's the kind of publicity which will secure the project all the more attention , not , however , that he will need to do much to nurture the nation 's interest . however abhorrent and thankfully incomprehensible cannibalism is to the world at large , it remains a source of morbid fascination .
von praunheim has been working on the subject for more than twenty years and has already written several scripts .
now he has been granted € 20,000 -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- in development money from the north rhine-westphalia film foundation for the project , which is going to be a mixture of thriller , grotesque and documentation . the background to the film is the case of the cannibal armin meiws , who was sentenced to 8 and a half years imprisonment for manslaughter after he was found guilty of killing and then eating parts of the engineer bernd jürgen b. von praunhein has long been considered a controversial filmmaker who is not afraid of tackling tough topics , which probably makes him the perfect man for this somewhat unsavoury job . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a full 67 percent of males aged between 14 and 54 change their skivvies daily , compared to just 50 percent of men over the age of 55 . women emerged from the survey looking slighty more decent .
90 percent of ladies between the age of 14 and 34 insist on fresh panties on a daily basis .
but as they get older , even their good habits start to slip .
only 85 percent of 35 to 54 year olds start the day with fresh smalls , and by the time they have reached the age of 55 , that figure has dropped to 67 percent . some folks - 4.5 percent of men and 2.1 percent of women - actually owned up to only changing their drawers once a week . when it comes to general cleanliness , women are marginally more game for a wash than men .
although , with just 39 percent of women and 37 percent of men taking a daily shower , neither gender could exactly be accused of going overboard when it comes to scrubbing up . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .

a full 67 percent of males aged between 14 and 54 change their skivvies daily , compared to just 50 percent of men over the age of 55 . women emerged from the survey looking slighty more decent .
90 percent of ladies between the age of 14 and 34 insist on fresh panties on a daily basis .

a full 67 percent of males aged between 14 and 54 change their skivvies daily , compared to just 50 percent of men over the age of 55 . women emerged from the survey looking slighty more decent .
90 percent of ladies between the age of 14 and 34 insist on fresh panties on a daily basis .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .

southwest of frankfurt , close to the french border - the nearest large town is kaiserslautern , home to a huge us military base - the district of kusel came up with a clever way to get a bigger piece of germany 's tourism pie .
pedal boats for the earthbound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " draisine " is the german term for pedal trolley they took a disused but scenic 40-kilometer -lrb- 25-mile -rrb- stretch of railroad track , outfitted it with the terrestrial equivalent of pedal boats , and set up the draisinentour - a change of pace from the typical bike tour , with the possibility to stop and sightsee along the way .
there 's no getting around it : a rail pedal trolley trip is fun , but hard work .
the rail trolley runs on four wheels and is pedaled exactly like a bicycle , but one whose wheels are fixed to the railroad tracks .
there is space on the trolley for up to four people - two can sit on the bicycles , and a bench that spans the tracks can hold up to two more adults or three children .
thunder thighs strong quadriceps are a plus - the trolley is heavy -lrb- plus there 's all that beer - oops , gear - stuck behind the bench .
this could be anything from a picnic lunch to a grill , to some real bikes for side trips , to the ever popular beer keg . -rrb-
on the positive side , since you do n't need to steer , you can give all your attention to the breathtaking landscape , or have a chat with your biking partner , or take a drink - or just sit back on the bench and let one of the other passengers have a turn at the pedals .
breaks encouraged so if you 're stuck fast to the tracks , how do you stop and take time to see the sights ?
the folks at nahe valley tourism have thought of everything .
for picnics , to rest , or for sightseeing stops in nearby towns , there are stopping stations every two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- or so along the route .
-lrb- riders who stop must first remove their trolley from the tracks , so that others can continue on . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not having to steer means you can enjoy the view trolley riders can choose between an overall tour of 20 kilometers or 40 kilometers .
if you 'd rather eat out than bring -lrb- and carry ! -rrb- a picnic , there are small restaurants and inns marked along the route .
the entire route goes from the town of staudernheim , via meisenheim and lauterecken , to altenglan in the palatinate hills , following the meandering glan river , and passing through green meadows , wooded hills and romantic valleys .
the trip also goes through numerous tiny towns and some larger ones as well , with a chance to visit little museums , churches , galleries , and vineyards en route .
reservations required each day the trip goes in one direction or the other , starting on odd-numbered days at lauterecken and even numbered days at staudernheim .
public buses bring you back to your starting point .
while little known outside the region , the trolley tour is becoming more and more popular ; reservations - especially on holidays and weekends - are an absolute necessity .
booking times can be as long as a year in advance .
a day on a trolley costs 35 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- during the week , or 39 euros on weekends and holidays .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.07.2004 putting the brakes on germany 's autobahn ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , formula one wannabes could face the radar gun while many sections of germany 's freeway system , or autobahn , allow drivers to cruise as fast as they want , politicians have begun calling for a general speed limit .
public opinion on the issue looks to be changing . there is something almost mythic about german autobahns .
to many they are nothing less than freedom itself , the ability to drive as fast as one 's heart desires and one 's automobile engine allows .
the network of well-maintained , black asphalt ribbons snaking their way across the landscape are symbols for some of one of the last unregulated aspects of german life . for a first timer on a german highways , the first brush with high-speed , high-performance driving can be an unsettling experience .
it 's not unusual to be cruising along at a brisk 160 kmh -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- and suddenly feel like you 're standing still as a bmw or mercedes flies past you in the left lane going 200 or 230 kmh -lrb- 125 or 136 mph -rrb- . but that freedom to drive full throttle might be entering its sunset as politicians from across the spectrum renew their demands to " bring sanity " to the country 's freeway system .
while calls to reign in unfettered drivers have been occasional occurrences in germany over the years , they have been generally received by the public with a mixture of scorn and derision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 cologne cathedral on unesco danger list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's cathedral could be off the world heritage list after eight years cologne 's magnificent gothic cathedral has been placed on unesco 's list of world heritage in danger due to the increasing development of the german city 's skyline . one of germany 's most iconic buildings , the historic cologne cathedral , has been put on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organisation 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger . the organization admitted concerns during its annual meeting that the construction of several highrise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral would damage the visual impact of one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture .
the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 and placed on the on the world heritage list in 1996 , is one of germany 's top tourist attractions but its integrity is being threatened by the increasing number of skyscrapers being built and planned for the rhineland city , according to a statement released during the annual meeting of the 21 member world heritage committee in the eastern chinese city of suzhou .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage centre , said in the statement .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
the cathedral , or dom , is the only site in europe to be included on the 32 site list , which is generally considered a source of shame for the countries involved .
birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation at the meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral was endangered , but recognised that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , the statement said . cologne 's christian democrat mayor fritz schramma rejected unesco 's decision on monday .
" it can not be that because a town has a cathedral , it may not develop , " he said .
" of course this must continue and this development will stand in harmony with the cathedral . "
nevertheless , there are obviously people who would have an aversion against a building more than 100 meters in height , added schramma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic fortress of bam , parts of which date back 2000 years , was partially destroyed by the earthquake last year .
cologne cathedral joined other sites considered in danger , such as the kathmandu valley in nepal and the ancient desert city of timbuktu in mali , which have been threatened by industry or mining , pollution , looting , war or uncontrolled tourism .
another site has been added to the list - the rich archaeological remains of the iranian city of bam -lrb- photo -rrb- , devastated by an earthquake last year .
so far , three sites have been taken off the danger list during the on-going meeting : cambodia 's angkor wat temple complex , the bahla fort of oman and the rwenzori mountains national park of uganda . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unesco honors three german treasures dresden 's romantic elbe valley , bremen 's historic spots and a park on the saxon-polish border will rub shoulders with the likes of venice and angkor wat as unesco accepted the german gems to the world heritage site list .

but both sides say they 'll continue to talk . immediately after monday 's meeting , spd national party leader franz müntefering and the head of the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , confirmed that differences of opinion remain on the central points of the spd 's reform plans , known as agenda 2010 .
a point of particular concern for the unions is the spd 's plan to consolidate unemployment and social welfare payments starting in 2005 - a plan the spd says is not up for debate . dgb 's vice-president , ursula engelen-kefer ´ , described the atmosphere during the meeting as " pretty agitated , " adding that such hefty arguments are hardly a " walk in the park .

" there 's no alternative to the course that the government has set since march 2003 , " hans werner busch , head of the employers ' association for the metalworking industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the unions ' choice to go on confrontation course was robbing them of the opportunity to contribute to the reform process , he said . the spd and the unions did agree however , to refuse support to a new grouping of left-wing rebels , who plan to found a party to challenge the spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

public opinion on the issue looks to be changing . there is something almost mythic about german autobahns .
to many they are nothing less than freedom itself , the ability to drive as fast as one 's heart desires and one 's automobile engine allows .
the network of well-maintained , black asphalt ribbons snaking their way across the landscape are symbols for some of one of the last unregulated aspects of german life . for a first timer on a german highways , the first brush with high-speed , high-performance driving can be an unsettling experience .
it 's not unusual to be cruising along at a brisk 160 kmh -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- and suddenly feel like you 're standing still as a bmw or mercedes flies past you in the left lane going 200 or 230 kmh -lrb- 125 or 136 mph -rrb- . but that freedom to drive full throttle might be entering its sunset as politicians from across the spectrum renew their demands to " bring sanity " to the country 's freeway system .
while calls to reign in unfettered drivers have been occasional occurrences in germany over the years , they have been generally received by the public with a mixture of scorn and derision .
this time , however , with gasoline prices at near record highs and increasing concerns about the environment and public safety , the pendulum is swinging toward a grudging acceptance of future limits on highway speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- spd -rrb- , deutscher politiker und friedensaktivist " it just makes sense , " ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairman of the environmental committee of the german parliament and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told dw-world .
" we do a lot of things to force industry and households to get their carbon dioxide emissions down , why should n't we do the same for cars ? " last month , he and politicians from across germany 's political spectrum reignited the debate over speed limits , calling for the introduction of a general limit of 130 kph limit -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- throughout the autobahn system . " it would be good for the environment and the climate , since pollutant emissions go up with high speeds , " said von weizsäcker .
" we could avoid unnecessary accidents and keep gasoline consumption down , since at very high speed , gas consumption is very high . " this time the calls for a deceleration are not just coming from the left-leaning spd and its environmentalist coalition partners , the greens .
the conservative opposition has also shown a willingness to move into the slow lane .
josef göppel , a parliamentarian for the christian social union and member of that party 's environment committee , told reporters he has long been in favor of a general limit of 130 kph and is sure many of his party colleagues feel the same .
he added it was now " unavoidable " that the country hold a rational discussion about speed limits . next page : taboo topic 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de autobahn tailgater conviction revives speed limit debate rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .

"
but whatever you call it , this bike-plus-bench-on-a-railroad-track makes for one fun , unusual , sightseeing trip . active tourists looking for a singular outdoor experience should make their way to germany 's little-known nahe valley , in the rhineland-palatinate region .
southwest of frankfurt , close to the french border - the nearest large town is kaiserslautern , home to a huge us military base - the district of kusel came up with a clever way to get a bigger piece of germany 's tourism pie .
pedal boats for the earthbound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " draisine " is the german term for pedal trolley they took a disused but scenic 40-kilometer -lrb- 25-mile -rrb- stretch of railroad track , outfitted it with the terrestrial equivalent of pedal boats , and set up the draisinentour - a change of pace from the typical bike tour , with the possibility to stop and sightsee along the way .
there 's no getting around it : a rail pedal trolley trip is fun , but hard work .
the rail trolley runs on four wheels and is pedaled exactly like a bicycle , but one whose wheels are fixed to the railroad tracks .
there is space on the trolley for up to four people - two can sit on the bicycles , and a bench that spans the tracks can hold up to two more adults or three children .
thunder thighs strong quadriceps are a plus - the trolley is heavy -lrb- plus there 's all that beer - oops , gear - stuck behind the bench .
this could be anything from a picnic lunch to a grill , to some real bikes for side trips , to the ever popular beer keg . -rrb-
on the positive side , since you do n't need to steer , you can give all your attention to the breathtaking landscape , or have a chat with your biking partner , or take a drink - or just sit back on the bench and let one of the other passengers have a turn at the pedals .
breaks encouraged so if you 're stuck fast to the tracks , how do you stop and take time to see the sights ?
the folks at nahe valley tourism have thought of everything .
for picnics , to rest , or for sightseeing stops in nearby towns , there are stopping stations every two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- or so along the route .
-lrb- riders who stop must first remove their trolley from the tracks , so that others can continue on . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not having to steer means you can enjoy the view trolley riders can choose between an overall tour of 20 kilometers or 40 kilometers .
if you 'd rather eat out than bring -lrb- and carry ! -rrb- a picnic , there are small restaurants and inns marked along the route .
the entire route goes from the town of staudernheim , via meisenheim and lauterecken , to altenglan in the palatinate hills , following the meandering glan river , and passing through green meadows , wooded hills and romantic valleys .
the trip also goes through numerous tiny towns and some larger ones as well , with a chance to visit little museums , churches , galleries , and vineyards en route .
reservations required each day the trip goes in one direction or the other , starting on odd-numbered days at lauterecken and even numbered days at staudernheim .
public buses bring you back to your starting point .
while little known outside the region , the trolley tour is becoming more and more popular ; reservations - especially on holidays and weekends - are an absolute necessity .
booking times can be as long as a year in advance .
a day on a trolley costs 35 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- during the week , or 39 euros on weekends and holidays .

but both sides say they 'll continue to talk . immediately after monday 's meeting , spd national party leader franz müntefering and the head of the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , confirmed that differences of opinion remain on the central points of the spd 's reform plans , known as agenda 2010 .
a point of particular concern for the unions is the spd 's plan to consolidate unemployment and social welfare payments starting in 2005 - a plan the spd says is not up for debate . dgb 's vice-president , ursula engelen-kefer ´ , described the atmosphere during the meeting as " pretty agitated , " adding that such hefty arguments are hardly a " walk in the park . " despite the lack of progress in resolving what 's become a very public dispute , both sides emphasized their willingness to keep the dialogue going .
sommer said germany 's problems could only be solved if the spd and the unions work together . the next meeting between the spd and union representatives is planned for october .
until then , both sides say , they will be in constant contact . conflict should be less public klaus uwe benneter , who serves as the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that chancellor gerhard schröder used the meeting to make it clear that he does n't approve of the way the unions are expressing their criticism . according to benneter , schröder called for a less public display of discord and articulated his wish that by the next meeting , both sides would have a common approach to the problems facing them . unions missing opportunity pressure is growing on the unions from industry representatives to abandon their strategy of resistance . " there 's no alternative to the course that the government has set since march 2003 , " hans werner busch , head of the employers ' association for the metalworking industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the unions ' choice to go on confrontation course was robbing them of the opportunity to contribute to the reform process , he said . the spd and the unions did agree however , to refuse support to a new grouping of left-wing rebels , who plan to found a party to challenge the spd .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .
supervie and costagliola believe that only the second wave of infection has been identified while the first one went unreported . first french symptoms ten years after outbreak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the first cases of the deadly disease were spotted in 1980 's britain , the french government was careful to ban imports of infected cows from the neighboring country .
however , the control of its own supplies only began years later , after the first bse symptoms were diagnosed in french bovines in 1991 . up until 1989 , nearly five years after the first bse case in great britain , french farmers were still feeding their livestock british offal ; remnants of the brain and spinal cord of dead animals which were used in animal feed and in which bse remains infectious . farmers still used infected feed so , for over a decade before the first french bse symptoms were noticed , farmers were creating their own outbreak on french soil by using infected animal feed .
it has also been suggested that french herds had been infected a long time before the 1980 's but had gone unidentified due to the lack of knowledge on the disease . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : file - a butcher is preparing beef in front of bse-testet pieces of spinal cord from a cattle in muelheim , germany , on tuesday , nov.14 , 2000 .
beginning next year the bse-test will be officially introduced in germany .
the test detects the mad cow disease , that can cause the creutzfeldt-jacob disease in humans .
the test takes 24 hours .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- the current publication comes at a very unfavorable time for the government in paris .
the french authorities recently announced the death of a 55-year-old man who suffered from the human variant of bse , creutzfeldt jakob 's disease -lrb- cjd -rrb- .
his death is the seventh cjd fatality registered by french doctors . study suggests cover-up in the report , cosagliola harshly criticizes the french authorities .
" one has known for some time that the official statistics do not reflect the true magnitude of the epidemic , " writes the scientist .
the facts support his claim .
according to official statistics , there were merely 923 cattle infected with bse in france during the last 13 years .
that leaves an estimated 290,000 bse animals unaccounted for in the official records . other evidence shows that the french authorities could have reacted to the potential epidemic at least four years ago .
in a report of the scientific committee of the eu -lrb- ssc -rrb- which appeared in july 2000 , experts warned about the danger of underestimating the numbers of bse cases in france .
according to germany der spiegel magazine which printed extracts of the report at the time , page five of the paper shows that there is " no clear picture about the number of bse cases -lrb- in france -rrb- .

but both sides say they 'll continue to talk . immediately after monday 's meeting , spd national party leader franz müntefering and the head of the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , confirmed that differences of opinion remain on the central points of the spd 's reform plans , known as agenda 2010 .
a point of particular concern for the unions is the spd 's plan to consolidate unemployment and social welfare payments starting in 2005 - a plan the spd says is not up for debate . dgb 's vice-president , ursula engelen-kefer ´ , described the atmosphere during the meeting as " pretty agitated , " adding that such hefty arguments are hardly a " walk in the park .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 and placed on the on the world heritage list in 1996 , is one of germany 's top tourist attractions but its integrity is being threatened by the increasing number of skyscrapers being built and planned for the rhineland city , according to a statement released during the annual meeting of the 21 member world heritage committee in the eastern chinese city of suzhou .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage centre , said in the statement .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
the cathedral , or dom , is the only site in europe to be included on the 32 site list , which is generally considered a source of shame for the countries involved .
birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation at the meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral was endangered , but recognised that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , the statement said . cologne 's christian democrat mayor fritz schramma rejected unesco 's decision on monday .
" it can not be that because a town has a cathedral , it may not develop , " he said .
" of course this must continue and this development will stand in harmony with the cathedral . "
nevertheless , there are obviously people who would have an aversion against a building more than 100 meters in height , added schramma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic fortress of bam , parts of which date back 2000 years , was partially destroyed by the earthquake last year .
cologne cathedral joined other sites considered in danger , such as the kathmandu valley in nepal and the ancient desert city of timbuktu in mali , which have been threatened by industry or mining , pollution , looting , war or uncontrolled tourism .
another site has been added to the list - the rich archaeological remains of the iranian city of bam -lrb- photo -rrb- , devastated by an earthquake last year .
so far , three sites have been taken off the danger list during the on-going meeting : cambodia 's angkor wat temple complex , the bahla fort of oman and the rwenzori mountains national park of uganda . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unesco honors three german treasures dresden 's romantic elbe valley , bremen 's historic spots and a park on the saxon-polish border will rub shoulders with the likes of venice and angkor wat as unesco accepted the german gems to the world heritage site list .

"
but whatever you call it , this bike-plus-bench-on-a-railroad-track makes for one fun , unusual , sightseeing trip . active tourists looking for a singular outdoor experience should make their way to germany 's little-known nahe valley , in the rhineland-palatinate region .
southwest of frankfurt , close to the french border - the nearest large town is kaiserslautern , home to a huge us military base - the district of kusel came up with a clever way to get a bigger piece of germany 's tourism pie .
pedal boats for the earthbound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " draisine " is the german term for pedal trolley they took a disused but scenic 40-kilometer -lrb- 25-mile -rrb- stretch of railroad track , outfitted it with the terrestrial equivalent of pedal boats , and set up the draisinentour - a change of pace from the typical bike tour , with the possibility to stop and sightsee along the way .
there 's no getting around it : a rail pedal trolley trip is fun , but hard work .
the rail trolley runs on four wheels and is pedaled exactly like a bicycle , but one whose wheels are fixed to the railroad tracks .
there is space on the trolley for up to four people - two can sit on the bicycles , and a bench that spans the tracks can hold up to two more adults or three children .
thunder thighs strong quadriceps are a plus - the trolley is heavy -lrb- plus there 's all that beer - oops , gear - stuck behind the bench .
this could be anything from a picnic lunch to a grill , to some real bikes for side trips , to the ever popular beer keg . -rrb-
on the positive side , since you do n't need to steer , you can give all your attention to the breathtaking landscape , or have a chat with your biking partner , or take a drink - or just sit back on the bench and let one of the other passengers have a turn at the pedals .
breaks encouraged so if you 're stuck fast to the tracks , how do you stop and take time to see the sights ?
the folks at nahe valley tourism have thought of everything .
for picnics , to rest , or for sightseeing stops in nearby towns , there are stopping stations every two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- or so along the route .
-lrb- riders who stop must first remove their trolley from the tracks , so that others can continue on . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not having to steer means you can enjoy the view trolley riders can choose between an overall tour of 20 kilometers or 40 kilometers .
if you 'd rather eat out than bring -lrb- and carry ! -rrb- a picnic , there are small restaurants and inns marked along the route .
the entire route goes from the town of staudernheim , via meisenheim and lauterecken , to altenglan in the palatinate hills , following the meandering glan river , and passing through green meadows , wooded hills and romantic valleys .
the trip also goes through numerous tiny towns and some larger ones as well , with a chance to visit little museums , churches , galleries , and vineyards en route .
reservations required each day the trip goes in one direction or the other , starting on odd-numbered days at lauterecken and even numbered days at staudernheim .
public buses bring you back to your starting point .
while little known outside the region , the trolley tour is becoming more and more popular ; reservations - especially on holidays and weekends - are an absolute necessity .
booking times can be as long as a year in advance .
a day on a trolley costs 35 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- during the week , or 39 euros on weekends and holidays .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings . " you ca n't win elections with speed limits , but you can lose them , " he said . long , close relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a replica of teh first motorized car by carl benz the country 's relationship with cars and driving is long .
the first successful internal-combustion engine was constructed in germany in 1878 by nikolaus otto .
today germany is home to some of the world 's leading makers of luxury , high-performance cars .
the names mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche have become synonymous with german expertise and play important roles in both the german economy , directly or indirectly employing some 18 percent of the work force , not to mention the national psyche . " when you buy a car in germany , you do n't do it with your brain , you do it because of the feeling , " jochen hövekenmeier , spokesman for the avd automobile club , told dw-world . he and others in the car industry and related fields are strongly against putting a general limit on autobahn speed .
they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions . " we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .
in a june survey commissioned by the newsmagazine stern and carried out by the forsa polling firm , 52 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of autobahn speed limits , while 45 percent rejected the idea . european harmonization but for von weizsäcker , it is time for germany to get in line with its european neighbors , all of which have speed limits on their freeways .
he also pointed out that after the may 1 expansion of the european union , germany lies in its center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on the autobahn the levels of transit traffic from east to west and vice versa is skyrocketing .
a speed limit could help keep traffic moving on the highways , which are almost at capacity . and while he understands that many drivers enamored with high speeds do not want the state to interfere in what he calls their " masculine showing , " he thinks it 's time to discard such ideas and cut the speed . " i believe it 's a reasonable thing , " he said , " a symbol of mature civilization .

public opinion on the issue looks to be changing . there is something almost mythic about german autobahns .
to many they are nothing less than freedom itself , the ability to drive as fast as one 's heart desires and one 's automobile engine allows .
the network of well-maintained , black asphalt ribbons snaking their way across the landscape are symbols for some of one of the last unregulated aspects of german life . for a first timer on a german highways , the first brush with high-speed , high-performance driving can be an unsettling experience .
it 's not unusual to be cruising along at a brisk 160 kmh -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- and suddenly feel like you 're standing still as a bmw or mercedes flies past you in the left lane going 200 or 230 kmh -lrb- 125 or 136 mph -rrb- . but that freedom to drive full throttle might be entering its sunset as politicians from across the spectrum renew their demands to " bring sanity " to the country 's freeway system .
while calls to reign in unfettered drivers have been occasional occurrences in germany over the years , they have been generally received by the public with a mixture of scorn and derision .
this time , however , with gasoline prices at near record highs and increasing concerns about the environment and public safety , the pendulum is swinging toward a grudging acceptance of future limits on highway speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- spd -rrb- , deutscher politiker und friedensaktivist " it just makes sense , " ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairman of the environmental committee of the german parliament and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told dw-world .
" we do a lot of things to force industry and households to get their carbon dioxide emissions down , why should n't we do the same for cars ? " last month , he and politicians from across germany 's political spectrum reignited the debate over speed limits , calling for the introduction of a general limit of 130 kph limit -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- throughout the autobahn system . " it would be good for the environment and the climate , since pollutant emissions go up with high speeds , " said von weizsäcker .

pedal boats for the earthbound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " draisine " is the german term for pedal trolley they took a disused but scenic 40-kilometer -lrb- 25-mile -rrb- stretch of railroad track , outfitted it with the terrestrial equivalent of pedal boats , and set up the draisinentour - a change of pace from the typical bike tour , with the possibility to stop and sightsee along the way .
there 's no getting around it : a rail pedal trolley trip is fun , but hard work .
the rail trolley runs on four wheels and is pedaled exactly like a bicycle , but one whose wheels are fixed to the railroad tracks .
there is space on the trolley for up to four people - two can sit on the bicycles , and a bench that spans the tracks can hold up to two more adults or three children .
thunder thighs strong quadriceps are a plus - the trolley is heavy -lrb- plus there 's all that beer - oops , gear - stuck behind the bench .
this could be anything from a picnic lunch to a grill , to some real bikes for side trips , to the ever popular beer keg . -rrb-
on the positive side , since you do n't need to steer , you can give all your attention to the breathtaking landscape , or have a chat with your biking partner , or take a drink - or just sit back on the bench and let one of the other passengers have a turn at the pedals .
breaks encouraged so if you 're stuck fast to the tracks , how do you stop and take time to see the sights ?
the folks at nahe valley tourism have thought of everything .
for picnics , to rest , or for sightseeing stops in nearby towns , there are stopping stations every two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- or so along the route .
-lrb- riders who stop must first remove their trolley from the tracks , so that others can continue on . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not having to steer means you can enjoy the view trolley riders can choose between an overall tour of 20 kilometers or 40 kilometers .
if you 'd rather eat out than bring -lrb- and carry ! -rrb- a picnic , there are small restaurants and inns marked along the route .
the entire route goes from the town of staudernheim , via meisenheim and lauterecken , to altenglan in the palatinate hills , following the meandering glan river , and passing through green meadows , wooded hills and romantic valleys .
the trip also goes through numerous tiny towns and some larger ones as well , with a chance to visit little museums , churches , galleries , and vineyards en route .
reservations required each day the trip goes in one direction or the other , starting on odd-numbered days at lauterecken and even numbered days at staudernheim .
public buses bring you back to your starting point .
while little known outside the region , the trolley tour is becoming more and more popular ; reservations - especially on holidays and weekends - are an absolute necessity .
booking times can be as long as a year in advance .
a day on a trolley costs 35 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- during the week , or 39 euros on weekends and holidays .

this time , however , with gasoline prices at near record highs and increasing concerns about the environment and public safety , the pendulum is swinging toward a grudging acceptance of future limits on highway speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- spd -rrb- , deutscher politiker und friedensaktivist " it just makes sense , " ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairman of the environmental committee of the german parliament and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told dw-world .
" we do a lot of things to force industry and households to get their carbon dioxide emissions down , why should n't we do the same for cars ? " last month , he and politicians from across germany 's political spectrum reignited the debate over speed limits , calling for the introduction of a general limit of 130 kph limit -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- throughout the autobahn system . " it would be good for the environment and the climate , since pollutant emissions go up with high speeds , " said von weizsäcker .
" we could avoid unnecessary accidents and keep gasoline consumption down , since at very high speed , gas consumption is very high . " this time the calls for a deceleration are not just coming from the left-leaning spd and its environmentalist coalition partners , the greens .
the conservative opposition has also shown a willingness to move into the slow lane .
josef göppel , a parliamentarian for the christian social union and member of that party 's environment committee , told reporters he has long been in favor of a general limit of 130 kph and is sure many of his party colleagues feel the same .
he added it was now " unavoidable " that the country hold a rational discussion about speed limits . next page : taboo topic 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de autobahn tailgater conviction revives speed limit debate rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .

they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions . " we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .

a point of particular concern for the unions is the spd 's plan to consolidate unemployment and social welfare payments starting in 2005 - a plan the spd says is not up for debate . dgb 's vice-president , ursula engelen-kefer ´ , described the atmosphere during the meeting as " pretty agitated , " adding that such hefty arguments are hardly a " walk in the park .

projected figures from the study suggest that the number of infected cows which made it into the french food chain as bse contaminated meat products could well be into the tens of thousands and may have already contributed to human deaths . " we assume that between 1980 and 2000 , a total of 301,200 cattle were infected in france with bse , " states the study by virginie supervie and dominique costagliola , the researchers responsible for exposing a new bse scandal in france .
according to the study published in the institute 's specialist journal , a total of 47,300 infected cattle had made it onto french consumers ' tables by 1996 . the most explosive aspect of the study implies massive negligence on the part of the health and safety standards authorities in france for allowing contaminated meat to become available to the french public , not once but twice .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution .

his subject matter already has germany 's conservatives , who find the whole thing too tasteless for words , choking .
it 's the kind of publicity which will secure the project all the more attention , not , however , that he will need to do much to nurture the nation 's interest . however abhorrent and thankfully incomprehensible cannibalism is to the world at large , it remains a source of morbid fascination .
von praunheim has been working on the subject for more than twenty years and has already written several scripts .
now he has been granted € 20,000 -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- in development money from the north rhine-westphalia film foundation for the project , which is going to be a mixture of thriller , grotesque and documentation . the background to the film is the case of the cannibal armin meiws , who was sentenced to 8 and a half years imprisonment for manslaughter after he was found guilty of killing and then eating parts of the engineer bernd jürgen b. von praunhein has long been considered a controversial filmmaker who is not afraid of tackling tough topics , which probably makes him the perfect man for this somewhat unsavoury job . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

his subject matter already has germany 's conservatives , who find the whole thing too tasteless for words , choking .
it 's the kind of publicity which will secure the project all the more attention , not , however , that he will need to do much to nurture the nation 's interest . however abhorrent and thankfully incomprehensible cannibalism is to the world at large , it remains a source of morbid fascination .
von praunheim has been working on the subject for more than twenty years and has already written several scripts .
now he has been granted € 20,000 -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- in development money from the north rhine-westphalia film foundation for the project , which is going to be a mixture of thriller , grotesque and documentation . the background to the film is the case of the cannibal armin meiws , who was sentenced to 8 and a half years imprisonment for manslaughter after he was found guilty of killing and then eating parts of the engineer bernd jürgen b. von praunhein has long been considered a controversial filmmaker who is not afraid of tackling tough topics , which probably makes him the perfect man for this somewhat unsavoury job . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

public opinion on the issue looks to be changing . there is something almost mythic about german autobahns .
to many they are nothing less than freedom itself , the ability to drive as fast as one 's heart desires and one 's automobile engine allows .
the network of well-maintained , black asphalt ribbons snaking their way across the landscape are symbols for some of one of the last unregulated aspects of german life . for a first timer on a german highways , the first brush with high-speed , high-performance driving can be an unsettling experience .
it 's not unusual to be cruising along at a brisk 160 kmh -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- and suddenly feel like you 're standing still as a bmw or mercedes flies past you in the left lane going 200 or 230 kmh -lrb- 125 or 136 mph -rrb- . but that freedom to drive full throttle might be entering its sunset as politicians from across the spectrum renew their demands to " bring sanity " to the country 's freeway system .
while calls to reign in unfettered drivers have been occasional occurrences in germany over the years , they have been generally received by the public with a mixture of scorn and derision .
this time , however , with gasoline prices at near record highs and increasing concerns about the environment and public safety , the pendulum is swinging toward a grudging acceptance of future limits on highway speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- spd -rrb- , deutscher politiker und friedensaktivist " it just makes sense , " ernst ulrich von weizsäcker -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairman of the environmental committee of the german parliament and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , told dw-world .
" we do a lot of things to force industry and households to get their carbon dioxide emissions down , why should n't we do the same for cars ? " last month , he and politicians from across germany 's political spectrum reignited the debate over speed limits , calling for the introduction of a general limit of 130 kph limit -lrb- 81 mph -rrb- throughout the autobahn system . " it would be good for the environment and the climate , since pollutant emissions go up with high speeds , " said von weizsäcker .
" we could avoid unnecessary accidents and keep gasoline consumption down , since at very high speed , gas consumption is very high . " this time the calls for a deceleration are not just coming from the left-leaning spd and its environmentalist coalition partners , the greens .
the conservative opposition has also shown a willingness to move into the slow lane .
josef göppel , a parliamentarian for the christian social union and member of that party 's environment committee , told reporters he has long been in favor of a general limit of 130 kph and is sure many of his party colleagues feel the same .
he added it was now " unavoidable " that the country hold a rational discussion about speed limits . next page : taboo topic 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de autobahn tailgater conviction revives speed limit debate rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings . " you ca n't win elections with speed limits , but you can lose them , " he said . long , close relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a replica of teh first motorized car by carl benz the country 's relationship with cars and driving is long .
the first successful internal-combustion engine was constructed in germany in 1878 by nikolaus otto .
today germany is home to some of the world 's leading makers of luxury , high-performance cars .
the names mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche have become synonymous with german expertise and play important roles in both the german economy , directly or indirectly employing some 18 percent of the work force , not to mention the national psyche . " when you buy a car in germany , you do n't do it with your brain , you do it because of the feeling , " jochen hövekenmeier , spokesman for the avd automobile club , told dw-world . he and others in the car industry and related fields are strongly against putting a general limit on autobahn speed .
they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions . " we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .
in a june survey commissioned by the newsmagazine stern and carried out by the forsa polling firm , 52 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of autobahn speed limits , while 45 percent rejected the idea . european harmonization but for von weizsäcker , it is time for germany to get in line with its european neighbors , all of which have speed limits on their freeways .
he also pointed out that after the may 1 expansion of the european union , germany lies in its center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on the autobahn the levels of transit traffic from east to west and vice versa is skyrocketing .
a speed limit could help keep traffic moving on the highways , which are almost at capacity . and while he understands that many drivers enamored with high speeds do not want the state to interfere in what he calls their " masculine showing , " he thinks it 's time to discard such ideas and cut the speed .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings . " you ca n't win elections with speed limits , but you can lose them , " he said . long , close relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a replica of teh first motorized car by carl benz the country 's relationship with cars and driving is long .
the first successful internal-combustion engine was constructed in germany in 1878 by nikolaus otto .
today germany is home to some of the world 's leading makers of luxury , high-performance cars .
the names mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche have become synonymous with german expertise and play important roles in both the german economy , directly or indirectly employing some 18 percent of the work force , not to mention the national psyche . " when you buy a car in germany , you do n't do it with your brain , you do it because of the feeling , " jochen hövekenmeier , spokesman for the avd automobile club , told dw-world . he and others in the car industry and related fields are strongly against putting a general limit on autobahn speed .
they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions . " we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .
in a june survey commissioned by the newsmagazine stern and carried out by the forsa polling firm , 52 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of autobahn speed limits , while 45 percent rejected the idea . european harmonization but for von weizsäcker , it is time for germany to get in line with its european neighbors , all of which have speed limits on their freeways .
he also pointed out that after the may 1 expansion of the european union , germany lies in its center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on the autobahn the levels of transit traffic from east to west and vice versa is skyrocketing .
a speed limit could help keep traffic moving on the highways , which are almost at capacity . and while he understands that many drivers enamored with high speeds do not want the state to interfere in what he calls their " masculine showing , " he thinks it 's time to discard such ideas and cut the speed . " i believe it 's a reasonable thing , " he said , " a symbol of mature civilization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

but both sides say they 'll continue to talk . immediately after monday 's meeting , spd national party leader franz müntefering and the head of the federation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , confirmed that differences of opinion remain on the central points of the spd 's reform plans , known as agenda 2010 .
a point of particular concern for the unions is the spd 's plan to consolidate unemployment and social welfare payments starting in 2005 - a plan the spd says is not up for debate . dgb 's vice-president , ursula engelen-kefer ´ , described the atmosphere during the meeting as " pretty agitated , " adding that such hefty arguments are hardly a " walk in the park . " despite the lack of progress in resolving what 's become a very public dispute , both sides emphasized their willingness to keep the dialogue going .
sommer said germany 's problems could only be solved if the spd and the unions work together . the next meeting between the spd and union representatives is planned for october .
until then , both sides say , they will be in constant contact . conflict should be less public klaus uwe benneter , who serves as the leader of the spd 's parliamentary group , said that chancellor gerhard schröder used the meeting to make it clear that he does n't approve of the way the unions are expressing their criticism . according to benneter , schröder called for a less public display of discord and articulated his wish that by the next meeting , both sides would have a common approach to the problems facing them . unions missing opportunity pressure is growing on the unions from industry representatives to abandon their strategy of resistance . " there 's no alternative to the course that the government has set since march 2003 , " hans werner busch , head of the employers ' association for the metalworking industry , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the unions ' choice to go on confrontation course was robbing them of the opportunity to contribute to the reform process , he said . the spd and the unions did agree however , to refuse support to a new grouping of left-wing rebels , who plan to found a party to challenge the spd .
" we made clear that there will be no support in terms of infrastructure for any founding of a new party or similar group , " sommer said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german leftist group emerges unhappy with the german government 's welfare reforms , trade union and social democratic party members have formed a new association that could pose a serious challenge in upcoming elections .

since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings .

" we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .
in a june survey commissioned by the newsmagazine stern and carried out by the forsa polling firm , 52 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of autobahn speed limits , while 45 percent rejected the idea . european harmonization but for von weizsäcker , it is time for germany to get in line with its european neighbors , all of which have speed limits on their freeways .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2004 ikea 's furniture is standard , but its prices are n't großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will ikea parking lots in poland be filled with cars bearing german license plates ?
not necessarily .
shoppers throughout europe may find the same selection of clean-lined , modern furniture at their local ikea , but the prices are not the same .
a european consumer organization has created the first ' ikea index ' . for good or bad , swedish furniture maker ikea has been credited with the " mcdonaldization of the furniture industry " .
by offering high-style , clean-lined furniture at affordable prices , ikea has bumped up the style factor in the average home , particularly in germany , which accounts for 20 percent of the company 's total sales .
the concept has proven so popular that ikea 's founder , ingvar kamprad , temporarily knocked microsoft founder bill gates out of the top spot on the list of the world 's richest men earlier this year .
but while ikea furniture may be synonymous with standardization , the prices at ikea outlets throughout europe are anything but , according to a report released on tuesday by the european consumer center -lrb- ecc -rrb- , a düsseldorf-based consumer advocacy organization and member of the european consumer centers network .
the european union formed the centers to help consumers benefit from the common european market .
buy your couch in poland , lamp in the czech republic in its third study comparing ikea prices , call it the " big mac " index of the furniture world , ecc looked at 75 products in 18 countries , including new eu members like poland and hungary for the first time .
the center found that the price for the same product varied as much as 72 percent and differed an average of 40 percent .
but compared to previous years , the prices in western european countries are becoming increasingly uniform , theo wolsing , a project director at the institute , told dw-world .
despite the harmonization of markets in western europe , the report showed , bargains can still be found at ikea warehouses in eastern europe , particularly in poland .
and that could translate into big savings for neighboring german consumers - at least those living close to the border .
for example , the popular " klippen sofa " model costs € 299 in germany , while across the border in poland it costs just € 190 .
ditto with the " enetri " shelf , which costs € 49.90 in germany and € 35.83 in poland .
but if it 's a deal on a lamp you 're after , do n't go to hungary , where the " steneby " lamp costs € 51.77 , but instead to the czech republic , where it costs € 30.32 , almost five euros less than in germany .
ikea tourism ?
with pricy gasoline costs and long distances between the swedish company 's trademark blue and yellow furniture warehouses , it is unlikely that a trend of " ikea tourism " will emerge .
but studies like ecc 's ikea index help consumers better compare costs across the common market as well as witness first hand the level of economic integration that 's been happening in europe .
common market good for consumers since it was founded by the european commission in 2002 , the european consumer center in düsseldorf has been publishing reports like the ikea study and another comparing e-commerce sites and practices across europe in an effort to promote transparency and help european consumers benefit from the common market . for most european consumers , the common market has already opened up new doors , wolsing says . " there are more advantages than disadvantages , " he says .
" it 's easier to compare prices from country to country , consumers have a larger variety of products on offer , and the internet has made ordering products from neighboring countries easy and reliable , " he points out .
what 's more , a german purchasing a product from spain has the same consumer rights as at home , thanks to eu-wide legislation governing such transactions . savvy consumers casting a wider when comparing prices - when it comes to furniture or other products , like cars - may find their efforts pay off . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu requires labels for gm food a new eu directive requiring labels for genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- food took effect sunday : some hailed it as a way to give people more choice , opponents said it did not go far enough as it excludes animal products .

not necessarily .
shoppers throughout europe may find the same selection of clean-lined , modern furniture at their local ikea , but the prices are not the same .
a european consumer organization has created the first ' ikea index ' . for good or bad , swedish furniture maker ikea has been credited with the " mcdonaldization of the furniture industry " .
by offering high-style , clean-lined furniture at affordable prices , ikea has bumped up the style factor in the average home , particularly in germany , which accounts for 20 percent of the company 's total sales .
the concept has proven so popular that ikea 's founder , ingvar kamprad , temporarily knocked microsoft founder bill gates out of the top spot on the list of the world 's richest men earlier this year .
but while ikea furniture may be synonymous with standardization , the prices at ikea outlets throughout europe are anything but , according to a report released on tuesday by the european consumer center -lrb- ecc -rrb- , a düsseldorf-based consumer advocacy organization and member of the european consumer centers network .
the european union formed the centers to help consumers benefit from the common european market .
buy your couch in poland , lamp in the czech republic in its third study comparing ikea prices , call it the " big mac " index of the furniture world , ecc looked at 75 products in 18 countries , including new eu members like poland and hungary for the first time .
the center found that the price for the same product varied as much as 72 percent and differed an average of 40 percent .
but compared to previous years , the prices in western european countries are becoming increasingly uniform , theo wolsing , a project director at the institute , told dw-world .
despite the harmonization of markets in western europe , the report showed , bargains can still be found at ikea warehouses in eastern europe , particularly in poland .
and that could translate into big savings for neighboring german consumers - at least those living close to the border .
for example , the popular " klippen sofa " model costs € 299 in germany , while across the border in poland it costs just € 190 .
ditto with the " enetri " shelf , which costs € 49.90 in germany and € 35.83 in poland .
but if it 's a deal on a lamp you 're after , do n't go to hungary , where the " steneby " lamp costs € 51.77 , but instead to the czech republic , where it costs € 30.32 , almost five euros less than in germany .

not necessarily .
shoppers throughout europe may find the same selection of clean-lined , modern furniture at their local ikea , but the prices are not the same .
a european consumer organization has created the first ' ikea index ' . for good or bad , swedish furniture maker ikea has been credited with the " mcdonaldization of the furniture industry " .
by offering high-style , clean-lined furniture at affordable prices , ikea has bumped up the style factor in the average home , particularly in germany , which accounts for 20 percent of the company 's total sales .
the concept has proven so popular that ikea 's founder , ingvar kamprad , temporarily knocked microsoft founder bill gates out of the top spot on the list of the world 's richest men earlier this year .
but while ikea furniture may be synonymous with standardization , the prices at ikea outlets throughout europe are anything but , according to a report released on tuesday by the european consumer center -lrb- ecc -rrb- , a düsseldorf-based consumer advocacy organization and member of the european consumer centers network .
the european union formed the centers to help consumers benefit from the common european market .
buy your couch in poland , lamp in the czech republic in its third study comparing ikea prices , call it the " big mac " index of the furniture world , ecc looked at 75 products in 18 countries , including new eu members like poland and hungary for the first time .
the center found that the price for the same product varied as much as 72 percent and differed an average of 40 percent .
but compared to previous years , the prices in western european countries are becoming increasingly uniform , theo wolsing , a project director at the institute , told dw-world .
despite the harmonization of markets in western europe , the report showed , bargains can still be found at ikea warehouses in eastern europe , particularly in poland .
and that could translate into big savings for neighboring german consumers - at least those living close to the border .
for example , the popular " klippen sofa " model costs € 299 in germany , while across the border in poland it costs just € 190 .
ditto with the " enetri " shelf , which costs € 49.90 in germany and € 35.83 in poland .
but if it 's a deal on a lamp you 're after , do n't go to hungary , where the " steneby " lamp costs € 51.77 , but instead to the czech republic , where it costs € 30.32 , almost five euros less than in germany .
ikea tourism ?
with pricy gasoline costs and long distances between the swedish company 's trademark blue and yellow furniture warehouses , it is unlikely that a trend of " ikea tourism " will emerge .
but studies like ecc 's ikea index help consumers better compare costs across the common market as well as witness first hand the level of economic integration that 's been happening in europe .

his subject matter already has germany 's conservatives , who find the whole thing too tasteless for words , choking .
it 's the kind of publicity which will secure the project all the more attention , not , however , that he will need to do much to nurture the nation 's interest . however abhorrent and thankfully incomprehensible cannibalism is to the world at large , it remains a source of morbid fascination .
von praunheim has been working on the subject for more than twenty years and has already written several scripts .
now he has been granted € 20,000 -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- in development money from the north rhine-westphalia film foundation for the project , which is going to be a mixture of thriller , grotesque and documentation . the background to the film is the case of the cannibal armin meiws , who was sentenced to 8 and a half years imprisonment for manslaughter after he was found guilty of killing and then eating parts of the engineer bernd jürgen b. von praunhein has long been considered a controversial filmmaker who is not afraid of tackling tough topics , which probably makes him the perfect man for this somewhat unsavoury job . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.07.2004 german soccer body on borrowed time after emergency summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mayer-vorfelder survived the summit but rebels still lie in wait a crucial meeting to heal the rifts in the german football association on monday diverted a potential rebellion but failed to fully resolve the major problems threatening the future of german soccer . the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is no closer to healing the deep divisions which are threatening the 2006 world cup finals or finding a successor to rudi völler as head coach of the national soccer team after a closed crisis meeting on monday .
the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .

the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .

" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .
foreign coach a real possibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could guus hiddink be germany 's first foreign coach ?
the shrinking list of potential coaches may lead germany to consider appointing their first foreign coach .
speculation so far has included psv eindhoven boss guus hiddink -lrb- photo -rrb- , who reached the world cup semi-finals with the netherlands in 1998 and south korea in 2002 , and danish coach morten olsen .
but for such a proud soccer nation which has won the major prizes in the game several times over with germans at the helm , this would be a huge loss of face . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german team still without a coach germany 's national soccer team remains coach-less after the top candidate surprisingly turned down the job .

the chancellor seems to be back pedalling on his health reforms , which were introduced with the decisive aim of removing the financial burden from state insurance companies and shifting it onto patients , doctors and pharmaceutical companies .
this week , the chancellor 's office announced plans to reduce the burden on the pharmaceutical industry , with government spokesman thomas steg calling on the social ministry to take the wishes of the pharmaceutical industry into consideration when fixing prices for medication .
the social ministry said the target savings figure would not be changed , but steg was confident that the industry would be allowed to wield some influence .
" the ministry will assess the situation carefully , and will certainly take on board possible advice and concerns from the pharmaceutical industry , " he said .
the state insurance companies warned against bowing to industry demands on the grounds that a system of free pricing would jeopardize the target savings figure . more briefs 06.07.2004 -pipe- east germans possess less buying power 06.07.2004 -pipe- clamp down on illegal building workers 05.07.2004 -pipe- schröder weighs in on longer work week 05.07.2004 -pipe- karstadtquelle to cut more jobs 05.07.2004 -pipe- service industry sees growth slowdown 02.07.2004 -pipe- germany sells russian debt bonds 02.07.2004 -pipe- study : german women shop more than men 02.07.2004 -pipe- tui threatens to leave hanover if easyjet comes radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings . " you ca n't win elections with speed limits , but you can lose them , " he said . long , close relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a replica of teh first motorized car by carl benz the country 's relationship with cars and driving is long .
the first successful internal-combustion engine was constructed in germany in 1878 by nikolaus otto .
today germany is home to some of the world 's leading makers of luxury , high-performance cars .
the names mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche have become synonymous with german expertise and play important roles in both the german economy , directly or indirectly employing some 18 percent of the work force , not to mention the national psyche . " when you buy a car in germany , you do n't do it with your brain , you do it because of the feeling , " jochen hövekenmeier , spokesman for the avd automobile club , told dw-world . he and others in the car industry and related fields are strongly against putting a general limit on autobahn speed .
they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions . " we also have to remember where our jobs are coming from , " hövenkenmeier added .
" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .
in a june survey commissioned by the newsmagazine stern and carried out by the forsa polling firm , 52 percent of germans asked said they were in favor of autobahn speed limits , while 45 percent rejected the idea . european harmonization but for von weizsäcker , it is time for germany to get in line with its european neighbors , all of which have speed limits on their freeways .
he also pointed out that after the may 1 expansion of the european union , germany lies in its center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic jam on the autobahn the levels of transit traffic from east to west and vice versa is skyrocketing .
a speed limit could help keep traffic moving on the highways , which are almost at capacity . and while he understands that many drivers enamored with high speeds do not want the state to interfere in what he calls their " masculine showing , " he thinks it 's time to discard such ideas and cut the speed . " i believe it 's a reasonable thing , " he said , " a symbol of mature civilization .

the chancellor seems to be back pedalling on his health reforms , which were introduced with the decisive aim of removing the financial burden from state insurance companies and shifting it onto patients , doctors and pharmaceutical companies .
this week , the chancellor 's office announced plans to reduce the burden on the pharmaceutical industry , with government spokesman thomas steg calling on the social ministry to take the wishes of the pharmaceutical industry into consideration when fixing prices for medication .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.07.2004 debate over diesel car filters heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : particulate filters -lrb- like the one shown here -rrb- , may soon be required in diesel cars .
german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.07.2004 debate over diesel car filters heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : particulate filters -lrb- like the one shown here -rrb- , may soon be required in diesel cars .
german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .
-lrb- june 11 , 2004 -rrb- economists call for higher petrol taxes in germany in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes .

german car manufacturers and environmentalists are battling over diesel cars .
should they be fitted with filters , and should motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models be given tax breaks ? tensions are rising between german car manufacturers and environmentalists .
at issue are diesel cars .
the latter group credit the rising popularity of diesel-powered models with a dangerous increase in cancer-causing particulate pollution . they are pushing for emissions limits to be set so low that car manufacturers will be forced to install filters .
meanwhile , car makers , particularly volkswagen , say the cost of fitting filters into smaller models is simply too high . both sides are vying for the attention of german chancellor gerhard schröder in the hope that he will come in on their side . filters for all models ? ahead of tuesday 's meeting between germany 's environmental minister jürgen trittin and chancellor schröder , where the two discussed the subject , environmentalists staged a publicity stunt to punch holes in volkswagen 's argument .
the alliance " no diesel without filters " , of which help the german environment -lrb- duh -rrb- is a participant , unveiled a diesel-powered smart car with a filter costing just € 200 . " we hereby belie the assertions of german car makers who claim particulate filters are not cost efficient , " said jürgen resch , the head of duh .
the organization claims filters for other smaller models , like the vw lupo and audi a2 , are also cheap at just € 250 .
" that 's what customers pay for the added option of a heated side-wing mirror , " said resch .
" volkswagen wants to gain a competitive edge at the cost of the environment and people 's health . " duh and other environmental organizations would like the government to set emission limits at 2.5 milligrams per kilometer , while volkswagen is hoping for higher limits of around 8 milligrams per kilometer , which it could adhere to without installing filters .
what 's more , environmentalists would like to see tax breaks for motorists who opt for so-called " clean diesel " models fitted with filters .
france has already introduced such a system . " generation cancer " ? whatever the other advantages of diesel-powered cars may be , they emit more carcinogenic sooty particles than traditional fossil-fuel burning cars .
these particles have been linked to lung cancer and trigger other adverse respiratory problems . according to a study conducted by the federal environmental agency , 14,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of diesel pollution . " we expect the chancellor to choose a limit based on what is technically possible and to introduce tax incentives on models with filters by 2006 , " said stefan bundscherer , an expert for the german association of environment and nature protection .
" thus germany 's ' generation golf ' children will not become ' generation cancer ' , " he added , referring to the gen-x type term used to describe germany 's younger generation , which overwhelmingly drove popular volkwagen golf models . however , it is not entirely clear if this posturing on the part of environmental groups has paid off .
thomas steg , a government spokesman , said on tuesday that the federal government was waiting for the european commission to set eu-wide limits - now expected to be released in the fall - and would re-examine the situation at that time . both sides may have to wait a bit longer to find out where the chancellor stands . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government split on ' clean diesel ' initiatives berlin says it wants to give tax breaks for cars with clean diesel , but a divided cabinet and automobile industry have stalled the effort - at least for now .
-lrb- june 11 , 2004 -rrb- economists call for higher petrol taxes in germany in the debate over how to cope with soaring oil prices , one german economist think tank has made an appeal for higher taxes .

back to first page back 2/2 rationality has not always characterized past debates about forcing drivers to let up on the gas pedal .
since the construction of the first autobahn between cologne and bonn in 1929 , there have never been regular speed limits on the system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a national limit of 100 kmh -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- was imposed during the 1973 energy crisis but was repealed in fewer than four months .
in the past , surveys have regularly shown that between 70 and 80 percent of drivers were against putting any kind of general limit on the german freeways . " the car is something very special in germany , so discussions about speed limits are not easy , " mathias knobloch , head of transport policy at auto club europe , a german automobile association , told dw-world .
he compares german 's affinity for unrestricted speed on the highway to many americans ' feelings about guns . " in the united states , they say , ' ok , we are free , we can use weapons , " ' he said .
" in germany , the equivalent might be ' we are free citizens , we have to drive without a speed limit . " ' he added that just as american politicians tread carefully around the gun issue with voters , leading german politicians have generally been unwilling to wholeheartedly endorse highway speed restrictions .
social democratic transportation minister manfred stolpe rejected the most recent calls to introduce a general limit , a stance that did not surprise knobloch , given the spd 's already low popularity ratings . " you ca n't win elections with speed limits , but you can lose them , " he said . long , close relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a replica of teh first motorized car by carl benz the country 's relationship with cars and driving is long .
the first successful internal-combustion engine was constructed in germany in 1878 by nikolaus otto .
today germany is home to some of the world 's leading makers of luxury , high-performance cars .
the names mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche have become synonymous with german expertise and play important roles in both the german economy , directly or indirectly employing some 18 percent of the work force , not to mention the national psyche . " when you buy a car in germany , you do n't do it with your brain , you do it because of the feeling , " jochen hövekenmeier , spokesman for the avd automobile club , told dw-world . he and others in the car industry and related fields are strongly against putting a general limit on autobahn speed .
they note that many stretches of the country 's 11,980 km -lrb- 7,444 miles -rrb- of freeway already have permanent limits on them and that other sections have so-called dynamic speed limits , which are imposed according to traffic , road or weather conditions .

" we sell a lot of cars all over the world because we have no speed limit , " he said .
" people want german cars because they know they 've been built for high speeds on the highway . " those kind of arguments appear to be carrying less and less weight with both politicians and the general public .

a speed limit could help keep traffic moving on the highways , which are almost at capacity . and while he understands that many drivers enamored with high speeds do not want the state to interfere in what he calls their " masculine showing , " he thinks it 's time to discard such ideas and cut the speed .

"
but whatever you call it , this bike-plus-bench-on-a-railroad-track makes for one fun , unusual , sightseeing trip . active tourists looking for a singular outdoor experience should make their way to germany 's little-known nahe valley , in the rhineland-palatinate region .
southwest of frankfurt , close to the french border - the nearest large town is kaiserslautern , home to a huge us military base - the district of kusel came up with a clever way to get a bigger piece of germany 's tourism pie .
pedal boats for the earthbound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " draisine " is the german term for pedal trolley they took a disused but scenic 40-kilometer -lrb- 25-mile -rrb- stretch of railroad track , outfitted it with the terrestrial equivalent of pedal boats , and set up the draisinentour - a change of pace from the typical bike tour , with the possibility to stop and sightsee along the way .
there 's no getting around it : a rail pedal trolley trip is fun , but hard work .
the rail trolley runs on four wheels and is pedaled exactly like a bicycle , but one whose wheels are fixed to the railroad tracks .
there is space on the trolley for up to four people - two can sit on the bicycles , and a bench that spans the tracks can hold up to two more adults or three children .
thunder thighs strong quadriceps are a plus - the trolley is heavy -lrb- plus there 's all that beer - oops , gear - stuck behind the bench .
this could be anything from a picnic lunch to a grill , to some real bikes for side trips , to the ever popular beer keg . -rrb-
on the positive side , since you do n't need to steer , you can give all your attention to the breathtaking landscape , or have a chat with your biking partner , or take a drink - or just sit back on the bench and let one of the other passengers have a turn at the pedals .
breaks encouraged so if you 're stuck fast to the tracks , how do you stop and take time to see the sights ?
the folks at nahe valley tourism have thought of everything .
for picnics , to rest , or for sightseeing stops in nearby towns , there are stopping stations every two kilometers -lrb- one mile -rrb- or so along the route .
-lrb- riders who stop must first remove their trolley from the tracks , so that others can continue on . -rrb-
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not having to steer means you can enjoy the view trolley riders can choose between an overall tour of 20 kilometers or 40 kilometers .
if you 'd rather eat out than bring -lrb- and carry ! -rrb- a picnic , there are small restaurants and inns marked along the route .
the entire route goes from the town of staudernheim , via meisenheim and lauterecken , to altenglan in the palatinate hills , following the meandering glan river , and passing through green meadows , wooded hills and romantic valleys .
the trip also goes through numerous tiny towns and some larger ones as well , with a chance to visit little museums , churches , galleries , and vineyards en route .
reservations required each day the trip goes in one direction or the other , starting on odd-numbered days at lauterecken and even numbered days at staudernheim .
public buses bring you back to your starting point .
while little known outside the region , the trolley tour is becoming more and more popular ; reservations - especially on holidays and weekends - are an absolute necessity .
booking times can be as long as a year in advance .
a day on a trolley costs 35 euros -lrb- $ 46 -rrb- during the week , or 39 euros on weekends and holidays .

the dfb was thrown into turmoil after the german team 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign ended with just two points , two goals and a first round elimination which immediately led to the resignation of völler .
it also prompted a serious review of the state of the german game which unearthed long-standing resentment towards dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder and the working practices of the association .
the emergency summit was expected to include calls for 71-year-old mayer-vorfelder 's head after five regional presidents of the dfb , who control most of the votes in the organization 's general assembly , accused him of leading the association with an " autocratic " style and warned that his re-election in october was far from assured .
dfb vice president englebert nelle who is leading the rebellion , the first in the organization 's 104-year history , told the stuttgarter zeitung on saturday that mayer-vorfelder was the " root of evil " in the dfb .
but mayer-vorfelder survived and turned attention away from his own survival to the search for a new national team coach .
the dfb president said at the meeting that he and dfb general secretary horst r. schmidt and werner hackmann , president of the bundesliga front office would join franz beckenbauer in a four-man commission set up to find a new germany coach .
germany looks to 2006 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the golden days of german soccer drift further into the past .
while the rebellion looks to have been quelled for now , there is growing concern surrounding the health of germany 's game with the next world cup being held in the country in 2006 .
the rebels have complained that the dfb has failed to promote the country 's talent and has missed opportunities to reform the structure of the sport in germany .
there are doubts that the current administration can do what is necessary for the nation which has won three world cups and three european championships to regain its role as a soccer superpower .
while the five regional heads leading the revolt represent the amateur side of the sport , the bundesliga 's professionals are far from keen to see mayer-vorfelder removed this close to the 2006 world cup .
" among those of us who have real say , we do n't have a problem with him , " said karl-heinz rummenigge , the president of bayern munich .
fifa watch situation with concern fifa , soccer 's world governing body , is also far from happy at the idea of a radical shake-up of the dfb so close to the next global showcase event .
fifa president sepp blatter spoke at the weekend of his concerns over the current crisis and the effect it may have on germany 's role as host of the 2006 world cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president joseph blatter has made his organization 's feelings very clear .
" if i think about the 2006 world cup in germany , it 's not the time to question the whole structure of german football , " blatter told the german sports agency sid on saturday .
" if that does happen , we will be very , very angry at fifa . "
on a national level , a weak performance from the host nation at the 2006 world cup could jeopardize the interest of the germans and affect the mood at the event .
franz beckenbauer , the head of the world cup organizing committee , warned that germany needed to produce a winner for the event or risk just that .
the first step in returning the team to form would be the appointment of the right coach , something that is proving increasingly difficult .
list of coaching candidates shrinking daily after former bayern munich coach and preferred candidate ottmar hitzfeld turned down the dfb 's offer last thursday , the association approached christoph daum , the man who was due to take over the team until a random drug test showed traces of cocaine in 2001 .
he too turned down the job , preferring to stay at his club side fenerbache in turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece coach otto rehhagel is the man the dfb want to restore past glories .
that prompted the dfb to turn their sights on greece coach otto rehhagel after he crafted a greek side lacking any obvious stars into european champions .
however , according to vasilios gagatsis , the head of greece 's soccer federation , rehhagel is going nowhere .
" we wo n't consider it at all .
otto just extended his contract , not just until 2006 , but until 2008 .
he will be with us until he retires .
he told me that himself , " gagatsis said .
the only other german candidate appears to be lothar matthäus , the former germany captain who played a record 150 times for germany and lifted both the world cup and european championship trophy for his country . matthäus , currently national coach of hungary , has made it clear that he would take the job if offered to him but his lack of coaching experience would be a disadvantage .

the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 and placed on the on the world heritage list in 1996 , is one of germany 's top tourist attractions but its integrity is being threatened by the increasing number of skyscrapers being built and planned for the rhineland city , according to a statement released during the annual meeting of the 21 member world heritage committee in the eastern chinese city of suzhou .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage centre , said in the statement .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
the cathedral , or dom , is the only site in europe to be included on the 32 site list , which is generally considered a source of shame for the countries involved .
birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation at the meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral was endangered , but recognised that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , the statement said . cologne 's christian democrat mayor fritz schramma rejected unesco 's decision on monday .
" it can not be that because a town has a cathedral , it may not develop , " he said .
" of course this must continue and this development will stand in harmony with the cathedral . "
nevertheless , there are obviously people who would have an aversion against a building more than 100 meters in height , added schramma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the historic fortress of bam , parts of which date back 2000 years , was partially destroyed by the earthquake last year .
cologne cathedral joined other sites considered in danger , such as the kathmandu valley in nepal and the ancient desert city of timbuktu in mali , which have been threatened by industry or mining , pollution , looting , war or uncontrolled tourism .
another site has been added to the list - the rich archaeological remains of the iranian city of bam -lrb- photo -rrb- , devastated by an earthquake last year .
so far , three sites have been taken off the danger list during the on-going meeting : cambodia 's angkor wat temple complex , the bahla fort of oman and the rwenzori mountains national park of uganda . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : unesco honors three german treasures dresden 's romantic elbe valley , bremen 's historic spots and a park on the saxon-polish border will rub shoulders with the likes of venice and angkor wat as unesco accepted the german gems to the world heritage site list .

the compromise amendment , supported by the government , was drafted by liberal democrat lord lester of herne hill .

labour peer lord peston called the government 's decision not to grant a free vote on the total ban , rejected 250 to 75 , " shameful " .

the government is about to announce proposals for britain 's second tolled motorway .
the " pay as you go " motorway is expected to run roughly parallel to the m6 between birmingham and manchester - currently one of the most congested routes in the country .
the four-lane 50 mile stretch of road would link up with britain 's only existing toll motorway , the m6 toll , which by-passes birmingham .
this morning , breakfast asked whether toll roads are the shape of things to come for britain 's drivers find out what breakfast viewers think motorway tolls , on your your say page we talked to the government 's former transport advisor , professor david begg begg : new roads fill up too quickly if they 're free from his point of view , the beauty of imposing a toll on a new road is that motorists have to think twice before using it , so the road does n't reach full capacity so quickly .
" if you build an extra lane on the m25 , it fills up within two or three years , " he explained .
" this is a smart move : it 's raising extra money so it does n't put pressure on the budget and the improvement in journey times will last for longer . " watch our interview with david begg we heard from the motoring organisation the aa , who fear that toll motorways may be used as a trojan horse , to sneak in further charges for motorists " there 's some mileage in this if road tax and fuel tax fall , " the aa 's john dawson told us .
he added : " motorists worry that it 's a trojan horse - that the next thing is that all motorways will become tolled , without much improvement . " watch our interview in full with john dawson , from the aa motoring trust we talked to stephen joseph , of the campaigning group transport 2000 watch our interview in full with stephen joseph the proposed new stretch of motorway , linking birmingham to manchester , would be labour 's first toll motorway .
the current m6 toll was designed and planned by the previous conservative government , although it did n't open until december 2003 at 50 miles , it would be almost twice as long as the existing m6 toll .
and charges are expected to be higher than the current toll motorway 's £ 3 a day for cars and £ 11 for hgvs .
would you be prepared to pay to by-pass the jams ?

the company said it was the first rail firm in the uk to provide the service .
first class passengers can get online free , said chief executive christopher garnett , but those in standard class will have to pay for the service .
business use gner , which operates between london kings cross , the east midlands , yorkshire , the north east and scotland , said it would provide uninterrupted wi-fi coverage at speeds of up to 125mph .
the launch follows successful trials among first class passengers on some services .
the technology will be installed on a further nine trains over the summer .
mr garnett said : " wireless internet is already proving invaluable to our business customers as a means of transforming train time into more productive working time .
" the technology also has major potential to create a more enjoyable leisure time experience on our trains , and that 's one of the major reasons why we 're now making it available throughout our new-look trains . "
standard fare holders will have to pay between £ 2.95 and £ 9.95 , depending on their length of access .
according to telecoms analysts bwcs , 625 million people worldwide will be travelling on wi-fi enabled trains within the next five years .

unicef uk figures show that scotland has proportionally more births in maternity units which have achieved " baby friendly " accreditation .
the initiative is a worldwide programme run by unicef and the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
the baby friendly award has been given to 46 % of maternity wards in scotland .
the figure compares to 34 % in northern ireland and wales respectively and 10 % in england .
the initiative aims to promote breastfeeding by training and supporting health professionals in giving mothers information about feeding their baby . "
changes need to be made , midwives want to make those changes , but all too often there is a manager standing in the way " andrew radford unicef uk baby friendly director research in the uk shows that nine out of 10 women who give up breastfeeding in the first six weeks of life said they stopped before they wanted to , but that better breastfeeding support would have made a difference .
hospitals are given the baby friendly award only after they have implemented a series of 10 steps to successful breastfeeding .
these include training all staff with the techniques of successful breastfeeding , encouraging breastfeeding on demand , skin-to-skin contact , and allowing mothers and babies to remain together 24 hours a day .
changes needed a hospital has to undergo rigorous assessment and examination by unicef professional staff before the award is given .
andrew radford , unicef uk baby friendly director , said : " this is great news for mothers and babies in scotland , who are increasingly likely to be given effective support to breastfeed successfully .
" we are delighted at the willingness of many scottish maternity units to work with us towards giving mothers the best possible care around breastfeeding . "
but mr radford said the picture in scotland was " patchy " with some areas providing poor services and advice .
he said : " changes need to be made , midwives want to make those changes , but all too often there is a manager standing in the way .
" breastfeeding has such overwhelming health benefits for babies that every parent should be demanding that their hospital becomes baby friendly . "
within the uk , breastfeeding levels are low compared with europe and much of the rest of the world , and there is a strong cultural and social context which can determine whether a woman chooses to breastfeed .
unicef said that overall breastfeeding rates in the uk have not increased for the past 20 years , but that baby friendly hospitals raise their rates by an average of 10.5 % over four years .
' real commitment ' gillian lenaghan , from the royal college of midwives in scotland , said she was delighted with the unicef report .
" not too long ago , scotland was the worst in europe for breastfeeding so the fact that this is happening is brilliant , " she told bbc news online .
" one of the reasons why scotland has come out top is probably because we do n't have the staff shortages they have in england .
" in scotland it 's more one-to-one whereas in england , especially in london and the south west , they have massive shortages .
" i think because scotland had such a low rate , there has been a real commitment to turn things around . "

these include training all staff with the techniques of successful breastfeeding , encouraging breastfeeding on demand , skin-to-skin contact , and allowing mothers and babies to remain together 24 hours a day .
changes needed a hospital has to undergo rigorous assessment and examination by unicef professional staff before the award is given .
andrew radford , unicef uk baby friendly director , said : " this is great news for mothers and babies in scotland , who are increasingly likely to be given effective support to breastfeed successfully .
breastfeeding in public is still sometimes taboo " we are delighted at the willingness of many scottish maternity units to work with us towards giving mothers the best possible care around breastfeeding . "
but mr radford said the picture in scotland was " patchy " with some areas providing poor services and advice .
he said : " changes need to be made , midwives want to make those changes , but all too often there is a manager standing in the way .
" breastfeeding has such overwhelming health benefits for babies that every parent should be demanding that their hospital becomes baby friendly . "
within the uk , breastfeeding levels are low compared with europe and much of the rest of the world , and there is a strong cultural and social context which can determine whether a woman chooses to breastfeed .
unicef said that overall breastfeeding rates in the uk have not increased for the past 20 years , but that baby friendly hospitals raise their rates by an average of 10.5 % over four years .
' real commitment ' gillian lenaghan , from the royal college of midwives in scotland , said she was delighted with the unicef report .
" not too long ago , scotland was the worst in europe for breastfeeding so the fact that this is happening is brilliant , " she told bbc news online .
" one of the reasons why scotland has come out top is probably because we do n't have the staff shortages they have in england .
" in scotland it 's more one-to-one whereas in england , especially in london and the south west , they have massive shortages .
" i think because scotland had such a low rate , there has been a real commitment to turn things around . "

police say figures show that more motorists now drink over the limit during the summer than at christmas .
there has also been a change in the traditional profile of the typical drink-driver , from the middle-aged to 18 to 25-year-olds .
police warn that barbecues and summer parties can mean drivers drinking " way above the legal limit " .
dyfed-powys police will spearhead the summer campaign , being run jointly with the other three welsh forces - south wales , gwent and north wales .
posters will go up in pubs showing a police car with the headline " we 're going out tonight too - catch you later " .
andy edwards , acting assistant chief constable of dyfed-powys , will launch the campaign in newtown later , by showing a damaged taxi hit by another car whose driver had been drinking .
bob parkes , the dyfed-powys road safety officer , said it was not clear why there had been an increase in the percentage of younger drink-drivers .
" for example over 35 % of those who were positive or who failed to provide -lrb- a sample -rrb- involved drivers under the age of 25 , " said mr parkes .
" i think a lot of it is to do with ' i 'm fit to drive after one or two ' . "
but , said mr parkes , many drivers did not realise the varying strengths of drinks , such as alcopops or cider .
hard core whereas an average beer might be the equivalent of one unit of alcohol , an alcopop could be considerably stronger .
police say anyone who deliberately broke the drink-drive laws would be tackled " robustly " .
although officers say it is only a small minority , there was a " hard core that are prepared to flout the law " .
police say their advice is straightforward : if you are going to drive , do not drink .
experts say that using units of alcohol is an unreliable way of measuring how much it is safe to drink and drive .
in addition to varying strengths of drinks , measures poured at home can be much bigger than in pubs .
police say there is no guaranteed way of knowing how much alcohol is in the body , and advise motorists to have only soft drinks .
but officers also recommend that people going out in groups should nominate a designated driver who will stick to soft drinks .
the summer campaign will run for the next two weeks , and will also include do n't drink and drive messages flashed above the two biggest roads in north and south wales : the a55 and m4 .
