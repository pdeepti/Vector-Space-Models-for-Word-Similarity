germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .
the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .
" but in the end , tui ca n't do much more -lrb- against risks -rrb- than the others .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .

a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible .

athens admitted earlier this month that its deficit figures had broken the eu 's three percent limit every year from 1999 onwards .
the issue will be discussed in the european commission meeting on wednesday and sources close to the greek government and the commission have confirmed that they believe a letter will be sent to the greek authorities , formally beginning infringement proceedings against them .
athens will then have two months to reply .
countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above three percent of gdp before joining the euro or during their membership of the euro zone .
the athens authorities incorrectly calculated income from social security , and military spending was not accounted for appropriately .
the greek finance ministry projects that it will reduce its deficit figure from an estimated 5.3 percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent next year , scraping back below the maximum permitted amount .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .

the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .

" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .

20-30 , said that starting next year foreign films will get the same billing as their us counterparts . " we have always had an international component , but from next year they will enter a jury competition , " a festival organizer told afp news service .
" we wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the american dramatic and documentary competitions . " organizers unveiled 16 films each in the competitions for independent us dramas , american documentaries and world cinema features , as well as 12 entries for world cinema documentaries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundance film festival logo the 12 films in the world cinema documentary section , which bring true stories from strife-torn countries such as iraq , chechnya , israel and rwanda to the screen , are frequently dark , organizers said .

it recounts the life and death of timothy treadwell , an amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist .
treadwell and his girlfriend were attacked and killed by a grizzly in october 2003 . other world documentaries recount such diverse tales as that of war-ravaged iraq 's most famous pianist , " the liberace of baghdad " by british director sean mcallister about pianist amir peter ; child casualties of the russian and chechen war ; the unsolved disappearance of an aboriginal leader , and the rwandan genocide . dutch documentary " shape of the moon " is about the life of three generations of an indonesian family , while the french-israeli production " wall , " tells of israel 's controversial security wall separating it from the palestinian territories .

ade , a graduate of munich 's tv and film academy -lrb- hff -rrb- , tells the story of a young woman who leaves her small town to start a teaching career . while hoping to win over her students with alternative methods and bright-eyed optimism , she soon realizes that what they really need is a taskmaster instead .
at the same time , she is trying to find love and ends up seeing her life 's plans disintegrate before her eyes . other films set to be screened include " the hero , " an angolan-french film telling of a survivor of angola 's protracted civil war , and denmark 's " brothers , " from director susanne bier , which looks at the story of two brothers who are sent to war in afghanistan . the 32 feature films competing were selected from among 2,613 movies submitted for consideration , including 1,385 us films and 1,228 international offerings . growing " hollywood-ization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert redford at a press conference for the 1996 festival redford -lrb- photo -rrb- launched the festival in 1981 as a small affair that gave non-mainstream filmmakers a rare forum at which to exhibit their work .
it was ruthlessly shunned by tinseltown at the time . but in recent years there has been growing criticism of the " hollywood-ization " of sundance that attracts the movie industry 's good and great in search of buying up films by independent talent . hidden jewels are what has made it increasingly important to the industry since the 1989 global sensation caused by the premiere here of the smash hit small film " sex , lies and videotape . " other small pictures that debuted at sundance and went on to achieve huge success include quentin tarantino 's " reservoir dogs , " and the dark scottish film " trainspotting .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .

human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.11.2004 schröder 's delicate russia problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin : friendly during earlier talks amid the crisis in ukraine , germany 's chancellor finds himself wedged ever tighter between a rock and a hard place as the european leader with the closest ties to russia 's putin the support russian president vladimir putin has given pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovych in ukraine 's disputed presidential election has left german chancellor gerhard schröder in an uneasy situation .
while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

a draft of the conclusions for a meeting of eu leaders next month , circulated by the dutch eu presidency on monday , set conditions that would mean ankara having to recognize cyprus and accept permanent restrictions on the movement of its workers .
reacting to the proposals , a spokesperson for turkey said " this is just a draft of a draft " adding that the state of negotiations could change between now and the eu leaders ' summit , which will take place on december 17 .
earlier this month , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul said that turkey should not join the eu " at any cost . "
the possible permanent restriction of workers is a very sensitive issue for both sides of the negotiations .
the issue of the divided island of cyprus is also extremely sensitive for ankara which only recognizes the turkish northern half of the island but not the greek southern part .
however , for the moment the " no recognition " policy remains the same .
" there will be no recognition of greek cyprus before the summit , " said the spokesperson .
for its part , cyprus has indicated it will veto turkey 's application if there is no movement on this issue - negotiations can only start if all 25 member states agree .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.11.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc greece to be held accountable the european commission on wednesday begins infringement proceedings against greece for incorrectly presenting statistics relating to its budget .
athens admitted earlier this month that its deficit figures had broken the eu 's three percent limit every year from 1999 onwards .
the issue will be discussed in the european commission meeting on wednesday and sources close to the greek government and the commission have confirmed that they believe a letter will be sent to the greek authorities , formally beginning infringement proceedings against them .
athens will then have two months to reply .
countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above three percent of gdp before joining the euro or during their membership of the euro zone .

20-30 , said that starting next year foreign films will get the same billing as their us counterparts . " we have always had an international component , but from next year they will enter a jury competition , " a festival organizer told afp news service .
" we wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the american dramatic and documentary competitions . " organizers unveiled 16 films each in the competitions for independent us dramas , american documentaries and world cinema features , as well as 12 entries for world cinema documentaries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundance film festival logo the 12 films in the world cinema documentary section , which bring true stories from strife-torn countries such as iraq , chechnya , israel and rwanda to the screen , are frequently dark , organizers said .

" grizzly man " the german entry in the world documentaries category is directed by werner herzog and called " grizzly man . "
it recounts the life and death of timothy treadwell , an amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist .
treadwell and his girlfriend were attacked and killed by a grizzly in october 2003 . other world documentaries recount such diverse tales as that of war-ravaged iraq 's most famous pianist , " the liberace of baghdad " by british director sean mcallister about pianist amir peter ; child casualties of the russian and chechen war ; the unsolved disappearance of an aboriginal leader , and the rwandan genocide . dutch documentary " shape of the moon " is about the life of three generations of an indonesian family , while the french-israeli production " wall , " tells of israel 's controversial security wall separating it from the palestinian territories .

ade , a graduate of munich 's tv and film academy -lrb- hff -rrb- , tells the story of a young woman who leaves her small town to start a teaching career . while hoping to win over her students with alternative methods and bright-eyed optimism , she soon realizes that what they really need is a taskmaster instead .
at the same time , she is trying to find love and ends up seeing her life 's plans disintegrate before her eyes . other films set to be screened include " the hero , " an angolan-french film telling of a survivor of angola 's protracted civil war , and denmark 's " brothers , " from director susanne bier , which looks at the story of two brothers who are sent to war in afghanistan . the 32 feature films competing were selected from among 2,613 movies submitted for consideration , including 1,385 us films and 1,228 international offerings . growing " hollywood-ization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert redford at a press conference for the 1996 festival redford -lrb- photo -rrb- launched the festival in 1981 as a small affair that gave non-mainstream filmmakers a rare forum at which to exhibit their work .

a draft of the conclusions for a meeting of eu leaders next month , circulated by the dutch eu presidency on monday , set conditions that would mean ankara having to recognize cyprus and accept permanent restrictions on the movement of its workers .
reacting to the proposals , a spokesperson for turkey said " this is just a draft of a draft " adding that the state of negotiations could change between now and the eu leaders ' summit , which will take place on december 17 .
earlier this month , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul said that turkey should not join the eu " at any cost . "
the possible permanent restriction of workers is a very sensitive issue for both sides of the negotiations .
the issue of the divided island of cyprus is also extremely sensitive for ankara which only recognizes the turkish northern half of the island but not the greek southern part .
however , for the moment the " no recognition " policy remains the same .
" there will be no recognition of greek cyprus before the summit , " said the spokesperson .
for its part , cyprus has indicated it will veto turkey 's application if there is no movement on this issue - negotiations can only start if all 25 member states agree .

they also criticized as inadequate proposed changes to the pact designed to underpin the euro .

athens admitted earlier this month that its deficit figures had broken the eu 's three percent limit every year from 1999 onwards .
the issue will be discussed in the european commission meeting on wednesday and sources close to the greek government and the commission have confirmed that they believe a letter will be sent to the greek authorities , formally beginning infringement proceedings against them .
athens will then have two months to reply .
countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above three percent of gdp before joining the euro or during their membership of the euro zone .
the athens authorities incorrectly calculated income from social security , and military spending was not accounted for appropriately .
the greek finance ministry projects that it will reduce its deficit figure from an estimated 5.3 percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent next year , scraping back below the maximum permitted amount .

by itself , however , it does not solve the problems of struggling pension programs .
from 1995 to 2000 , the european population would have shrunk by 4.4 million if 5 million migrants had not arrived during that period , says this year ’ s un world economic and social survey . even if 600,000 immigrants a year arrive in europe between 2000 and 2050 , the european population is still likely to decline by 96 million in that period .
" in any event , incoming migration would have to expand at virtually impossible rates to offset declining support ratios , that is workers per retirees , " warns the report .
in the future , spain is projected to have one of the world ’ s highest support ratios .
historically , most member states have not regarded themselves as receiving countries and people are not generally encouraged to seek citizenship .

western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko has refused to accept the results , charging there was widespread ballot fraud . the parliamentary motion had called for the sacking of the government , the prosecutor general , and the governors of the eastern donetsk and lugansk regions , yanukovych 's strongholds . ballot fraud allegations have focused on the two yanukovych bastions , which have also been at the forefront of threats by ukraine 's eastern and southern russian-speaking regions to seek autonomy from kiev . debate set for second hearing the parliament ended its meeting tuesday without adopting a no-confidence motion .
but speaker volodymyr litvin told lawmakers they would resume debate wednesday on a " well formulated and agreed text . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushenko .
addressing lawmakers , yushchenko said the government should resign for rigging the vote in the disputed election .
" the government must resign for these actions made in the east , for its handling of the budget , for the falsifications during the election , " said yushchenko . talk of separatism quashed earlier in the day , the on-going crisis had prompted the country ’ s central government to quash talk of separatism in the russian-speaking east of the country , as ukraine remained deadlocked over the disputed elections as compromise proposals failed to gain any apparent traction . as the state 's judicial and legislative branches continued to deliberate on the pro-western opposition charges that the elections were rigged , yanukovych floated two proposals for resolving the nine-day-old crisis . firstly , he said if his preliminary victory were upheld he would offer the post of prime minister to yushchenko .
and secondly , if the nov .
21 ballot were ruled too flawed to stand , he would support a repeat election , provided neither he nor yushchenko were candidates again . both overtures were swiftly rejected by yushchenko .
" no , i can not accept these proposals , " yushchenko told reporters , without elaborating . eu 's solana heads back to kiev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana .
as the deadlock continued , european union foreign policy chief javier solana headed back to ukraine on tuesday in another attempt at mediation just days after his first visit on friday , the eu 's dutch presidency said .
solana will consult in kiev with all sides before heading to moscow , dutch foreign minister ben bot told reporters . " what we think is necessary would be to have a re-run of the elections , " bot reaffirmed .
“ mr. solana is on his way now to discuss with all the parties concerned .
this -lrb- a re-run -rrb- is one of the possibilities .
we have to wait of course for the verdict of the supreme court , " he added . " he 's traveling to kiev , and then afterwards he 's going to moscow .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .

a draft of the conclusions for a meeting of eu leaders next month , circulated by the dutch eu presidency on monday , set conditions that would mean ankara having to recognize cyprus and accept permanent restrictions on the movement of its workers .
reacting to the proposals , a spokesperson for turkey said " this is just a draft of a draft " adding that the state of negotiations could change between now and the eu leaders ' summit , which will take place on december 17 .
earlier this month , turkish foreign minister abdullah gul said that turkey should not join the eu " at any cost . "
the possible permanent restriction of workers is a very sensitive issue for both sides of the negotiations .
the issue of the divided island of cyprus is also extremely sensitive for ankara which only recognizes the turkish northern half of the island but not the greek southern part .
however , for the moment the " no recognition " policy remains the same .
" there will be no recognition of greek cyprus before the summit , " said the spokesperson .
for its part , cyprus has indicated it will veto turkey 's application if there is no movement on this issue - negotiations can only start if all 25 member states agree .
-lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- dw-world.de germany , france want turkey in eu germany and france offered a ringing endorsement for turkey 's future membership in the eu at a bilateral summit tuesday .
they also criticized as inadequate proposed changes to the pact designed to underpin the euro .

the resolution was not supported by the communist party and received only 196 votes , short of the 226 votes needed in the 450-member assembly to be approved . ukraine has been gripped by a political crisis since the disputed nov .
21 elections , in which pro-russia yanukovych was declared the winner .
western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko has refused to accept the results , charging there was widespread ballot fraud . the parliamentary motion had called for the sacking of the government , the prosecutor general , and the governors of the eastern donetsk and lugansk regions , yanukovych 's strongholds . ballot fraud allegations have focused on the two yanukovych bastions , which have also been at the forefront of threats by ukraine 's eastern and southern russian-speaking regions to seek autonomy from kiev . debate set for second hearing the parliament ended its meeting tuesday without adopting a no-confidence motion .
but speaker volodymyr litvin told lawmakers they would resume debate wednesday on a " well formulated and agreed text . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushenko .
addressing lawmakers , yushchenko said the government should resign for rigging the vote in the disputed election .
" the government must resign for these actions made in the east , for its handling of the budget , for the falsifications during the election , " said yushchenko . talk of separatism quashed earlier in the day , the on-going crisis had prompted the country ’ s central government to quash talk of separatism in the russian-speaking east of the country , as ukraine remained deadlocked over the disputed elections as compromise proposals failed to gain any apparent traction . as the state 's judicial and legislative branches continued to deliberate on the pro-western opposition charges that the elections were rigged , yanukovych floated two proposals for resolving the nine-day-old crisis . firstly , he said if his preliminary victory were upheld he would offer the post of prime minister to yushchenko .
and secondly , if the nov .
21 ballot were ruled too flawed to stand , he would support a repeat election , provided neither he nor yushchenko were candidates again . both overtures were swiftly rejected by yushchenko .
" no , i can not accept these proposals , " yushchenko told reporters , without elaborating . eu 's solana heads back to kiev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana .
as the deadlock continued , european union foreign policy chief javier solana headed back to ukraine on tuesday in another attempt at mediation just days after his first visit on friday , the eu 's dutch presidency said .
solana will consult in kiev with all sides before heading to moscow , dutch foreign minister ben bot told reporters . " what we think is necessary would be to have a re-run of the elections , " bot reaffirmed .
“ mr. solana is on his way now to discuss with all the parties concerned .
this -lrb- a re-run -rrb- is one of the possibilities .
we have to wait of course for the verdict of the supreme court , " he added . " he 's traveling to kiev , and then afterwards he 's going to moscow .

athens admitted earlier this month that its deficit figures had broken the eu 's three percent limit every year from 1999 onwards .
the issue will be discussed in the european commission meeting on wednesday and sources close to the greek government and the commission have confirmed that they believe a letter will be sent to the greek authorities , formally beginning infringement proceedings against them .
athens will then have two months to reply .
countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above three percent of gdp before joining the euro or during their membership of the euro zone .
the athens authorities incorrectly calculated income from social security , and military spending was not accounted for appropriately .
the greek finance ministry projects that it will reduce its deficit figure from an estimated 5.3 percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent next year , scraping back below the maximum permitted amount .

the resolution was not supported by the communist party and received only 196 votes , short of the 226 votes needed in the 450-member assembly to be approved . ukraine has been gripped by a political crisis since the disputed nov .
21 elections , in which pro-russia yanukovych was declared the winner .
western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko has refused to accept the results , charging there was widespread ballot fraud . the parliamentary motion had called for the sacking of the government , the prosecutor general , and the governors of the eastern donetsk and lugansk regions , yanukovych 's strongholds . ballot fraud allegations have focused on the two yanukovych bastions , which have also been at the forefront of threats by ukraine 's eastern and southern russian-speaking regions to seek autonomy from kiev . debate set for second hearing the parliament ended its meeting tuesday without adopting a no-confidence motion .
but speaker volodymyr litvin told lawmakers they would resume debate wednesday on a " well formulated and agreed text . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushenko .
addressing lawmakers , yushchenko said the government should resign for rigging the vote in the disputed election .
" the government must resign for these actions made in the east , for its handling of the budget , for the falsifications during the election , " said yushchenko . talk of separatism quashed earlier in the day , the on-going crisis had prompted the country ’ s central government to quash talk of separatism in the russian-speaking east of the country , as ukraine remained deadlocked over the disputed elections as compromise proposals failed to gain any apparent traction . as the state 's judicial and legislative branches continued to deliberate on the pro-western opposition charges that the elections were rigged , yanukovych floated two proposals for resolving the nine-day-old crisis . firstly , he said if his preliminary victory were upheld he would offer the post of prime minister to yushchenko .
and secondly , if the nov .
21 ballot were ruled too flawed to stand , he would support a repeat election , provided neither he nor yushchenko were candidates again . both overtures were swiftly rejected by yushchenko .
" no , i can not accept these proposals , " yushchenko told reporters , without elaborating . eu 's solana heads back to kiev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana .
as the deadlock continued , european union foreign policy chief javier solana headed back to ukraine on tuesday in another attempt at mediation just days after his first visit on friday , the eu 's dutch presidency said .
solana will consult in kiev with all sides before heading to moscow , dutch foreign minister ben bot told reporters . " what we think is necessary would be to have a re-run of the elections , " bot reaffirmed .
“ mr. solana is on his way now to discuss with all the parties concerned .
this -lrb- a re-run -rrb- is one of the possibilities .
we have to wait of course for the verdict of the supreme court , " he added . " he 's traveling to kiev , and then afterwards he 's going to moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.11.2004 tackling terror threats to tourism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are tourists well enough informed before disaster strikes paradise ?
germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .
the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .
" but in the end , tui ca n't do much more -lrb- against risks -rrb- than the others . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the changing face of tourism after a tough few years , the tourism branch is back , with a few changes .

" regardless of the law of the place of commission , the german criminal law is also applicable to … acts committed outside of germany , " the law reads . while the law could be interpreted as an obligation to act in cases of crimes against international law , a clause leaves it up to prosecutors to decide whether alleged crimes should be brought before a german court . prosecution can be dropped in cases where neither the victim nor the perpetrator of a crime are german citizens .
if the accused is not in germany nor can be expected to come to germany , prosecution can also be dropped . germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries justified these limitations by saying that germany should not act as a " global policeman " by prosecuting all crimes against international law regardless of where they have been committed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld sued for alleged war crimes alleging responsibility for war crimes and torture at baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , a human rights group has filed a criminal complaint in germany against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and other top us officials .

athens admitted earlier this month that its deficit figures had broken the eu 's three percent limit every year from 1999 onwards .
the issue will be discussed in the european commission meeting on wednesday and sources close to the greek government and the commission have confirmed that they believe a letter will be sent to the greek authorities , formally beginning infringement proceedings against them .
athens will then have two months to reply .
countries are not permitted to run a budget deficit above three percent of gdp before joining the euro or during their membership of the euro zone .
the athens authorities incorrectly calculated income from social security , and military spending was not accounted for appropriately .
the greek finance ministry projects that it will reduce its deficit figure from an estimated 5.3 percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent next year , scraping back below the maximum permitted amount .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .

the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .

" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .

in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .

here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.11.2004 schröder 's delicate russia problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin : friendly during earlier talks amid the crisis in ukraine , germany 's chancellor finds himself wedged ever tighter between a rock and a hard place as the european leader with the closest ties to russia 's putin the support russian president vladimir putin has given pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovych in ukraine 's disputed presidential election has left german chancellor gerhard schröder in an uneasy situation .
while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "

20-30 , said that starting next year foreign films will get the same billing as their us counterparts . " we have always had an international component , but from next year they will enter a jury competition , " a festival organizer told afp news service .
" we wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the american dramatic and documentary competitions . " organizers unveiled 16 films each in the competitions for independent us dramas , american documentaries and world cinema features , as well as 12 entries for world cinema documentaries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundance film festival logo the 12 films in the world cinema documentary section , which bring true stories from strife-torn countries such as iraq , chechnya , israel and rwanda to the screen , are frequently dark , organizers said . " as one might expect , a number of films explore the human costs and response to war and conflict in regions throughout the world , " said sundance film festival director geoffrey gilmore . " grizzly man " the german entry in the world documentaries category is directed by werner herzog and called " grizzly man . "
it recounts the life and death of timothy treadwell , an amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist .
treadwell and his girlfriend were attacked and killed by a grizzly in october 2003 . other world documentaries recount such diverse tales as that of war-ravaged iraq 's most famous pianist , " the liberace of baghdad " by british director sean mcallister about pianist amir peter ; child casualties of the russian and chechen war ; the unsolved disappearance of an aboriginal leader , and the rwandan genocide . dutch documentary " shape of the moon " is about the life of three generations of an indonesian family , while the french-israeli production " wall , " tells of israel 's controversial security wall separating it from the palestinian territories . " the forest for the trees " in the world cinema dramatic competition , the german entry was directed by maren ade and is called " the forest for the trees " -lrb- " der wald vor lauter bäumen " -rrb- .
ade , a graduate of munich 's tv and film academy -lrb- hff -rrb- , tells the story of a young woman who leaves her small town to start a teaching career . while hoping to win over her students with alternative methods and bright-eyed optimism , she soon realizes that what they really need is a taskmaster instead .
at the same time , she is trying to find love and ends up seeing her life 's plans disintegrate before her eyes . other films set to be screened include " the hero , " an angolan-french film telling of a survivor of angola 's protracted civil war , and denmark 's " brothers , " from director susanne bier , which looks at the story of two brothers who are sent to war in afghanistan . the 32 feature films competing were selected from among 2,613 movies submitted for consideration , including 1,385 us films and 1,228 international offerings . growing " hollywood-ization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert redford at a press conference for the 1996 festival redford -lrb- photo -rrb- launched the festival in 1981 as a small affair that gave non-mainstream filmmakers a rare forum at which to exhibit their work .
it was ruthlessly shunned by tinseltown at the time . but in recent years there has been growing criticism of the " hollywood-ization " of sundance that attracts the movie industry 's good and great in search of buying up films by independent talent . hidden jewels are what has made it increasingly important to the industry since the 1989 global sensation caused by the premiere here of the smash hit small film " sex , lies and videotape . " other small pictures that debuted at sundance and went on to achieve huge success include quentin tarantino 's " reservoir dogs , " and the dark scottish film " trainspotting .

it will help mitigate international concern about the nature of iran 's program and over time should help to build confidence with regard to iran 's nuclear programme , " iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said . us : security council still an option but the head of the us team at the world 's nuclear body said washington still did not rule out taking iran to the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

" the people and the officials are not scared of the political threats made by the powers in the service of oppression , " khamenei was quoted as saying by state television in tehran . " iran will never stop its nuclear programme , that is our red line , " he said . iaea to continue investigations the adoption of the resolution ended a roller-coaster week of back-door talks when iran 's demand to exempt 20 centrifuges had threatened to torpedo the agreement reached earlier this month with the three european countries . but iran backed off on its demand and the resolution did not demand that the islamic republic be taken to the un security council for possible sanctions , as the us had wanted . the iaea is continuing to investigate iran as elbaradei has said that while no diversion of nuclear materials for weapons purposes has been detected , he could not rule out that there might be covert activity . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran allegedly builds secret facility for nuke program iran has been constructing a secret tunnel since october to continue uranium enrichment , despite a deal two weeks ago to freeze the program , german news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .

11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry .

not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .

11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .

" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry .

not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .

for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .

human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .

the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .

human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .

the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .

11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .

the resolution was not supported by the communist party and received only 196 votes , short of the 226 votes needed in the 450-member assembly to be approved . ukraine has been gripped by a political crisis since the disputed nov .
21 elections , in which pro-russia yanukovych was declared the winner .
western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko has refused to accept the results , charging there was widespread ballot fraud . the parliamentary motion had called for the sacking of the government , the prosecutor general , and the governors of the eastern donetsk and lugansk regions , yanukovych 's strongholds . ballot fraud allegations have focused on the two yanukovych bastions , which have also been at the forefront of threats by ukraine 's eastern and southern russian-speaking regions to seek autonomy from kiev . debate set for second hearing the parliament ended its meeting tuesday without adopting a no-confidence motion .

" the government must resign for these actions made in the east , for its handling of the budget , for the falsifications during the election , " said yushchenko . talk of separatism quashed earlier in the day , the on-going crisis had prompted the country ’ s central government to quash talk of separatism in the russian-speaking east of the country , as ukraine remained deadlocked over the disputed elections as compromise proposals failed to gain any apparent traction . as the state 's judicial and legislative branches continued to deliberate on the pro-western opposition charges that the elections were rigged , yanukovych floated two proposals for resolving the nine-day-old crisis . firstly , he said if his preliminary victory were upheld he would offer the post of prime minister to yushchenko .
and secondly , if the nov .

" regardless of the law of the place of commission , the german criminal law is also applicable to … acts committed outside of germany , " the law reads . while the law could be interpreted as an obligation to act in cases of crimes against international law , a clause leaves it up to prosecutors to decide whether alleged crimes should be brought before a german court . prosecution can be dropped in cases where neither the victim nor the perpetrator of a crime are german citizens .
if the accused is not in germany nor can be expected to come to germany , prosecution can also be dropped . germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries justified these limitations by saying that germany should not act as a " global policeman " by prosecuting all crimes against international law regardless of where they have been committed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld sued for alleged war crimes alleging responsibility for war crimes and torture at baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , a human rights group has filed a criminal complaint in germany against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and other top us officials .

" regardless of the law of the place of commission , the german criminal law is also applicable to … acts committed outside of germany , " the law reads . while the law could be interpreted as an obligation to act in cases of crimes against international law , a clause leaves it up to prosecutors to decide whether alleged crimes should be brought before a german court . prosecution can be dropped in cases where neither the victim nor the perpetrator of a crime are german citizens .
if the accused is not in germany nor can be expected to come to germany , prosecution can also be dropped . germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries justified these limitations by saying that germany should not act as a " global policeman " by prosecuting all crimes against international law regardless of where they have been committed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld sued for alleged war crimes alleging responsibility for war crimes and torture at baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , a human rights group has filed a criminal complaint in germany against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and other top us officials .

20-30 , said that starting next year foreign films will get the same billing as their us counterparts . " we have always had an international component , but from next year they will enter a jury competition , " a festival organizer told afp news service .
" we wanted to give world cinema more emphasis and have now put it on par with the american dramatic and documentary competitions . " organizers unveiled 16 films each in the competitions for independent us dramas , american documentaries and world cinema features , as well as 12 entries for world cinema documentaries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sundance film festival logo the 12 films in the world cinema documentary section , which bring true stories from strife-torn countries such as iraq , chechnya , israel and rwanda to the screen , are frequently dark , organizers said .

" grizzly man " the german entry in the world documentaries category is directed by werner herzog and called " grizzly man . "
it recounts the life and death of timothy treadwell , an amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist .

ade , a graduate of munich 's tv and film academy -lrb- hff -rrb- , tells the story of a young woman who leaves her small town to start a teaching career . while hoping to win over her students with alternative methods and bright-eyed optimism , she soon realizes that what they really need is a taskmaster instead .
at the same time , she is trying to find love and ends up seeing her life 's plans disintegrate before her eyes . other films set to be screened include " the hero , " an angolan-french film telling of a survivor of angola 's protracted civil war , and denmark 's " brothers , " from director susanne bier , which looks at the story of two brothers who are sent to war in afghanistan . the 32 feature films competing were selected from among 2,613 movies submitted for consideration , including 1,385 us films and 1,228 international offerings . growing " hollywood-ization " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert redford at a press conference for the 1996 festival redford -lrb- photo -rrb- launched the festival in 1981 as a small affair that gave non-mainstream filmmakers a rare forum at which to exhibit their work .

" grizzly man " the german entry in the world documentaries category is directed by werner herzog and called " grizzly man . "
it recounts the life and death of timothy treadwell , an amateur grizzly bear expert and wildlife preservationist .

" this is clearly a first step in the right direction .
it will help mitigate international concern about the nature of iran 's program and over time should help to build confidence with regard to iran 's nuclear programme , " iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said . us : security council still an option but the head of the us team at the world 's nuclear body said washington still did not rule out taking iran to the united nations security council for possible sanctions . " the united states reserves all its options with respect to security council consideration of the iranian nuclear weapons program , " said jackie sanders .
" we believe iran 's nuclear weapons program poses a growing threat to international peace and security , and to the global non-proliferation regime . " british prime minister tony blair pledged he would " hold iran to account " over its promises to halt its uranium enrichment program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.11.2004 schröder 's delicate russia problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin : friendly during earlier talks amid the crisis in ukraine , germany 's chancellor finds himself wedged ever tighter between a rock and a hard place as the european leader with the closest ties to russia 's putin the support russian president vladimir putin has given pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovych in ukraine 's disputed presidential election has left german chancellor gerhard schröder in an uneasy situation .
while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .
the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.11.2004 schröder 's delicate russia problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin : friendly during earlier talks amid the crisis in ukraine , germany 's chancellor finds himself wedged ever tighter between a rock and a hard place as the european leader with the closest ties to russia 's putin the support russian president vladimir putin has given pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovych in ukraine 's disputed presidential election has left german chancellor gerhard schröder in an uneasy situation .
while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .
the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .
" but in the end , tui ca n't do much more -lrb- against risks -rrb- than the others .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .

the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .

" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .

the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .

the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

the resolution was not supported by the communist party and received only 196 votes , short of the 226 votes needed in the 450-member assembly to be approved . ukraine has been gripped by a political crisis since the disputed nov .
21 elections , in which pro-russia yanukovych was declared the winner .
western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko has refused to accept the results , charging there was widespread ballot fraud . the parliamentary motion had called for the sacking of the government , the prosecutor general , and the governors of the eastern donetsk and lugansk regions , yanukovych 's strongholds . ballot fraud allegations have focused on the two yanukovych bastions , which have also been at the forefront of threats by ukraine 's eastern and southern russian-speaking regions to seek autonomy from kiev . debate set for second hearing the parliament ended its meeting tuesday without adopting a no-confidence motion .
but speaker volodymyr litvin told lawmakers they would resume debate wednesday on a " well formulated and agreed text . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushenko .
addressing lawmakers , yushchenko said the government should resign for rigging the vote in the disputed election .
" the government must resign for these actions made in the east , for its handling of the budget , for the falsifications during the election , " said yushchenko . talk of separatism quashed earlier in the day , the on-going crisis had prompted the country ’ s central government to quash talk of separatism in the russian-speaking east of the country , as ukraine remained deadlocked over the disputed elections as compromise proposals failed to gain any apparent traction . as the state 's judicial and legislative branches continued to deliberate on the pro-western opposition charges that the elections were rigged , yanukovych floated two proposals for resolving the nine-day-old crisis . firstly , he said if his preliminary victory were upheld he would offer the post of prime minister to yushchenko .
and secondly , if the nov .
21 ballot were ruled too flawed to stand , he would support a repeat election , provided neither he nor yushchenko were candidates again . both overtures were swiftly rejected by yushchenko .
" no , i can not accept these proposals , " yushchenko told reporters , without elaborating . eu 's solana heads back to kiev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana .
as the deadlock continued , european union foreign policy chief javier solana headed back to ukraine on tuesday in another attempt at mediation just days after his first visit on friday , the eu 's dutch presidency said .
solana will consult in kiev with all sides before heading to moscow , dutch foreign minister ben bot told reporters . " what we think is necessary would be to have a re-run of the elections , " bot reaffirmed .
“ mr. solana is on his way now to discuss with all the parties concerned .
this -lrb- a re-run -rrb- is one of the possibilities .
we have to wait of course for the verdict of the supreme court , " he added . " he 's traveling to kiev , and then afterwards he 's going to moscow .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "

11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .

all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry .

not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

the resolution was not supported by the communist party and received only 196 votes , short of the 226 votes needed in the 450-member assembly to be approved . ukraine has been gripped by a political crisis since the disputed nov .
21 elections , in which pro-russia yanukovych was declared the winner .
western-leaning opposition leader viktor yushchenko has refused to accept the results , charging there was widespread ballot fraud . the parliamentary motion had called for the sacking of the government , the prosecutor general , and the governors of the eastern donetsk and lugansk regions , yanukovych 's strongholds . ballot fraud allegations have focused on the two yanukovych bastions , which have also been at the forefront of threats by ukraine 's eastern and southern russian-speaking regions to seek autonomy from kiev . debate set for second hearing the parliament ended its meeting tuesday without adopting a no-confidence motion .
but speaker volodymyr litvin told lawmakers they would resume debate wednesday on a " well formulated and agreed text . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushenko .
addressing lawmakers , yushchenko said the government should resign for rigging the vote in the disputed election .
" the government must resign for these actions made in the east , for its handling of the budget , for the falsifications during the election , " said yushchenko . talk of separatism quashed earlier in the day , the on-going crisis had prompted the country ’ s central government to quash talk of separatism in the russian-speaking east of the country , as ukraine remained deadlocked over the disputed elections as compromise proposals failed to gain any apparent traction . as the state 's judicial and legislative branches continued to deliberate on the pro-western opposition charges that the elections were rigged , yanukovych floated two proposals for resolving the nine-day-old crisis . firstly , he said if his preliminary victory were upheld he would offer the post of prime minister to yushchenko .
and secondly , if the nov .
21 ballot were ruled too flawed to stand , he would support a repeat election , provided neither he nor yushchenko were candidates again . both overtures were swiftly rejected by yushchenko .
" no , i can not accept these proposals , " yushchenko told reporters , without elaborating . eu 's solana heads back to kiev bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana .
as the deadlock continued , european union foreign policy chief javier solana headed back to ukraine on tuesday in another attempt at mediation just days after his first visit on friday , the eu 's dutch presidency said .
solana will consult in kiev with all sides before heading to moscow , dutch foreign minister ben bot told reporters . " what we think is necessary would be to have a re-run of the elections , " bot reaffirmed .
“ mr. solana is on his way now to discuss with all the parties concerned .
this -lrb- a re-run -rrb- is one of the possibilities .

" this is clearly a first step in the right direction .
it will help mitigate international concern about the nature of iran 's program and over time should help to build confidence with regard to iran 's nuclear programme , " iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said . us : security council still an option but the head of the us team at the world 's nuclear body said washington still did not rule out taking iran to the united nations security council for possible sanctions .

" we believe iran 's nuclear weapons program poses a growing threat to international peace and security , and to the global non-proliferation regime . " british prime minister tony blair pledged he would " hold iran to account " over its promises to halt its uranium enrichment program . " our task has been to get the undertakings from iran , but to recognise that in the end we will have to make sure -lrb- we use -rrb- the right authority - in this case the atomic energy authority - then make sure the undertakings they have given are actually adhered to , " blair said . but iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said his country would press on with its nuclear programme and was not afraid of pressure from the us . " the people and the officials are not scared of the political threats made by the powers in the service of oppression , " khamenei was quoted as saying by state television in tehran . " iran will never stop its nuclear programme , that is our red line , " he said . iaea to continue investigations the adoption of the resolution ended a roller-coaster week of back-door talks when iran 's demand to exempt 20 centrifuges had threatened to torpedo the agreement reached earlier this month with the three european countries . but iran backed off on its demand and the resolution did not demand that the islamic republic be taken to the un security council for possible sanctions , as the us had wanted . the iaea is continuing to investigate iran as elbaradei has said that while no diversion of nuclear materials for weapons purposes has been detected , he could not rule out that there might be covert activity . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran allegedly builds secret facility for nuke program iran has been constructing a secret tunnel since october to continue uranium enrichment , despite a deal two weeks ago to freeze the program , german news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

" regardless of the law of the place of commission , the german criminal law is also applicable to … acts committed outside of germany , " the law reads . while the law could be interpreted as an obligation to act in cases of crimes against international law , a clause leaves it up to prosecutors to decide whether alleged crimes should be brought before a german court . prosecution can be dropped in cases where neither the victim nor the perpetrator of a crime are german citizens .
if the accused is not in germany nor can be expected to come to germany , prosecution can also be dropped . germany 's justice minister brigitte zypries justified these limitations by saying that germany should not act as a " global policeman " by prosecuting all crimes against international law regardless of where they have been committed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld sued for alleged war crimes alleging responsibility for war crimes and torture at baghdad 's abu ghraib prison , a human rights group has filed a criminal complaint in germany against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld and other top us officials .

but success at home is no longer sufficient : saic aims to become one of the world 's six largest car makers by 2010 . first steps to achieve this goal have already been taken .
if the chinese government approves the deal , state-owned saic has announced a cooperation with struggling british car maker rover that will basically result in a takeover .
the company plans to produce one million rover cars per year and sell them in europe and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mini mg rover convertible the deal is expected to cost saic about € 1.4 billion and comes just weeks after the chinese paid almost € 400 million for south korean suv maker ssangyong .
but saic expects to get more than just brand names by investing in these companies , according to experts . collecting know-how " the chinese want to collect know-how and not just produce cars for other companies under license agreements " such as volkswagen and general motors , who have kept control over technology , said albrecht denninghoff , a car market analyst for germany 's hypovereinsbank . by buying rover , saic now also wants to produce its own cars .
the company plans to make 50,000 automobiles under its own name by 2007 .
growing competition in china 's automotive industry is one of the reasons why companies are looking to expand abroad : too many cars are being produced , causing the prices to fall . other chinese firms have also started to eye the european market - albeit employing a different strategy .
carmaker chery , for example , wants to export its discount models overseas .
while the company sold 1,200 cars abroad in 2003 , it aims to export 10,000 vehicles this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car production in china volkswagen and general motors , who have invested billions in the people 's republic , are starting to be concerned about such expansionist plans and accuse the chinese of copying their cars and throwing them on the market at dumping prices .
there have been allegations that chery has developed a car that is mainly built with vw jetta parts . investment is backfiring " the investment in china is beginning to backfire , " denninghoff said .
" yesterday 's partners are today 's competitors .
how are people going to prevent technology that 's been transferred under license agreements from returning to europe ? " german car industry representatives estimate that china will become the world 's third largest producer - behind the us and japan - and push germany in the no. 4 spot , according to die welt newspaper : chinese car production will overtake germany 's output by the second half of 2005 at the latest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen passat cars in shanghai the chinese arrival on the european market has local carmakers worried about falling prices .
this reduces profits , which are already not that great , at least as far as the big carmakers are concerned , denninghoff said . pontential vw or opel customers are less and less willing to pay premium prices while others , such as toyota , offer the same amount of car for less money .
japanese and south korean carmakers already control 17 percent of the european market . " european cars have to become more distinguished again , " denninghoff said , adding that costs need to come down in order to stay competitive . ralf jäckel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler expands in china german carmaker daimlerchrysler plans to invest € 1.2 billion -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- in china .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .
the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .
" but in the end , tui ca n't do much more -lrb- against risks -rrb- than the others .

but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .
the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .
" but in the end , tui ca n't do much more -lrb- against risks -rrb- than the others .

instructors allegedly tied up their charges , covered their heads with hoods and in some cases , administered electric shocks . a scandal in germany surrounding the alleged abuse of army recruits by their officers widened on friday when the government revealed it had been informed of at least one other case .
a total of 20 non-commissioned officers and a captain are already under investigation by prosecutors in the western city of münster , accused of mistreating 80 of their charges at a barracks in coesfeld , at least half of whom were doing national service .
but the army 's representative in the bundestag lower house of parliament , willfried penner , has been informed of more accusations of mistreatment , his spokesman guido large told a weekly press conference .
" we are looking into this , " large said , but declined to give further details . new case die welt newspaper reported on friday that the new case concerned a barracks in north rhine-westphalia and that the events resembled those in the case being investigated in coesfeld .
one of the soldiers in that case told the top-selling bild newspaper that instructors had tied up recruits , covered their heads and administered electric shocks .
there was a code word that recruits could use to end the exercise , but only one of the young soldiers used it , the soldier told bild .
one non-commissioned officer in the coesfeld case has admitted mistreating the recruits with electric shocks and " deeply regrets " his actions , his lawyer said this week . argument for military service the president of the federation of german soldiers -lrb- dbwv -rrb- , bernhard gertz , said the revelations of mistreatment were a good reason to maintain compulsory military service , which has been the subject of a major debate in germany recently .

while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .

the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .

" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .

in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .

in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .
the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .
" but in the end , tui ca n't do much more -lrb- against risks -rrb- than the others . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the changing face of tourism after a tough few years , the tourism branch is back , with a few changes .

germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .
but tui 's plan to introduce a risk certificate is n't getting a lot of support . to tui it 's a sign they care deeply about the well-being of their customers .
to others , it 's a clever marketing ploy .
whatever the take , the tourism titan 's proposal to let pricewaterhouse coopers evaluate its crisis management system is a first in an industry that critics say has preferred to keep its ongoing security debate out of the public eye .
a tui spokesman said the plan will allow the company to see how well it prepares customers travelling to high-risk areas and how it responds when a crisis occurs .
at the end of the evaluation , the company will receive a certificate from the global consulting firm that will confirm that its warning and response system to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters , is as good as possible . " the communication policy regarding security was very conservative for a long time .
there was this idea that we 're a sunshine branch , and such a discussion does n't belong here , " a tui spokesman said .
" but we saw that it was important to our customers , and that 's why we wanted to take this step . "
clever ploy in a tight market analysts say it 's a clever one in a branch that has been suffering declining sales in recent years .

11 terrorist attacks in the us and ensuing attacks on european tourists on the tunisian island of djerba and in the sahara plunged the industry into a crisis from which it has only recently begun recovering . germans , who along with americans are the tourism industry 's most dependable customers , initially followed the trend , spending $ 2 billion -lrb- € 1.5 billion -rrb- less on tourism in 2001 compared to the previous year .
in 2002 , they spent $ 53.2 billion , only slightly higher than the $ 53 billion they spent in 2000 , according to the world tourism organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists : in demand in such a market , every little incentive to choose one competitor over another can help .
" a certification is a way of answering the question : ' how can i separate myself from the competition ? ' , " said günter schröder , an industry expert and author of several books on tourism , in an interview . how much can they do ? in reality , said schröder , tui ca n't offer anything new in the way of risk prevention and crisis management .
all tourism companies have contacts in the regions to which they plan trips that assess the security situation .
they also rely heavily on germany 's foreign ministry , which issues monthly travel warnings , for help in informing their customers . some argue that those measures are n't enough .
the parents of a six-year-old boy badly burned in a terrorism attack on djerba in april 2002 sued the company for not adequately informing them of the risks of traveling to the region .
tui won the case at the end of october after judges found the company did all it could to warn its customers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an explosion at a synagogue in djerba killed 19 tourists and shook the tourism industry the company 's pro-active approach is annoying its competitors , who say there is no need to make such a certification standard in the industry . " we think our established crisis management system is good enough , " rolf-dieter grass , a spokesman for thomas cook , said .
" we do n't see the necessity for such a -lrb- certification -rrb- . "
not to be taken lightly some analysts also disagree with the way in which tui is calling attention to what is a very serious subject .
" i think the security topic is too important for companies to establish as a competitive advantage , " said peter höbel , an expert at the risk management company crisadvice in an interview with reuters . at a conference for german tourism organizations in mallorca over the weekend , there did n't seem to be much support for making tui 's plan apply to the entire industry .
but schröder thinks that might not be too important . " they 're doing it because they want to appease their customers , " he explained .

" this is clearly a first step in the right direction .
it will help mitigate international concern about the nature of iran 's program and over time should help to build confidence with regard to iran 's nuclear programme , " iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said . us : security council still an option but the head of the us team at the world 's nuclear body said washington still did not rule out taking iran to the united nations security council for possible sanctions . " the united states reserves all its options with respect to security council consideration of the iranian nuclear weapons program , " said jackie sanders .
" we believe iran 's nuclear weapons program poses a growing threat to international peace and security , and to the global non-proliferation regime . " british prime minister tony blair pledged he would " hold iran to account " over its promises to halt its uranium enrichment program . " our task has been to get the undertakings from iran , but to recognise that in the end we will have to make sure -lrb- we use -rrb- the right authority - in this case the atomic energy authority - then make sure the undertakings they have given are actually adhered to , " blair said . but iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said his country would press on with its nuclear programme and was not afraid of pressure from the us . " the people and the officials are not scared of the political threats made by the powers in the service of oppression , " khamenei was quoted as saying by state television in tehran . " iran will never stop its nuclear programme , that is our red line , " he said . iaea to continue investigations the adoption of the resolution ended a roller-coaster week of back-door talks when iran 's demand to exempt 20 centrifuges had threatened to torpedo the agreement reached earlier this month with the three european countries . but iran backed off on its demand and the resolution did not demand that the islamic republic be taken to the un security council for possible sanctions , as the us had wanted . the iaea is continuing to investigate iran as elbaradei has said that while no diversion of nuclear materials for weapons purposes has been detected , he could not rule out that there might be covert activity . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran allegedly builds secret facility for nuke program iran has been constructing a secret tunnel since october to continue uranium enrichment , despite a deal two weeks ago to freeze the program , german news weekly der spiegel reported in an issue to be published monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.11.2004 schröder 's delicate russia problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin : friendly during earlier talks amid the crisis in ukraine , germany 's chancellor finds himself wedged ever tighter between a rock and a hard place as the european leader with the closest ties to russia 's putin the support russian president vladimir putin has given pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovych in ukraine 's disputed presidential election has left german chancellor gerhard schröder in an uneasy situation .
while many european countries have condemned the official election results which proclaimed yanukovych the winner , schröder 's criticism was muted .
increasingly , political observers are calling for schröder to take a stronger stand in support of the democratic process in ukraine , on behalf of the international community .
personal friends at the opening of an annual political meeting in berlin on tuesday , dick morris , the us campaign advisor to bill clinton , demanded more decisive action on the part of the german leader .
" schröder has the best relationship to russian president putin .
he should use it for the good of the international community , " morris told a press conference at the opening of the meeting , which hosts 700 top international political players .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder at the russian leader 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia , monday aug .
30 , 2004 .
the chancellor is a personal friend of putin 's and the two leaders and their wives even celebrated orthodox christmas together in moscow in 2001 .
for his part , schröder has actively promoted a positive relationship between the cold war foes - what he calls a " strategic partnership . "
the unspoken concern , however , is that too much pressure from germany to persuade russia to back off its support for the pro-kremlin yanukovych could put that relationship under strain .
schröder ' under pressure ' but even within schröder 's own government there is growing dissent on how to approach the issue .
recently , his coalition of social democrats and greens issued statements aimed at appeasing the chancellor 's increasingly loud critics , both from the conservative opposition as well as from outside the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators wave an orange flag in front of police blocking a street to the ukrainian presidental administration building in kiev , tuesday , nov .
23 , 2004 .
" the crisis in ukraine puts the chancellor in a difficult situation , " alexander rahr , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations told afp news agency .
" he is under pressure from both the german opposition and his own party . "
human rights supporters within schröder 's social democratic party and the greens are critical of his policy towards putin and are pushing for him to back the supporters of ukraine 's pro-western opposition candidate , viktor yushchenko .
but it would be in berlin 's interest " not to burn its bridges " with russia or the russian-speaking eastern ukraine which strongly backs yanukovych , rahr said with a view to german exports to russia , which have more than doubled since 1999 . germany is also growing more dependent on its close ties to the kremlin as it imports 30 percent of its gas from russia and plans to increase that to 40 percent in the next few years .
diplomatic ties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin meets schröder july 8 , 2004 for kremlin talks on expanding economic cooperation between the two nations .
the schröder-putin friendship functions not only on an economic level , but on a diplomatic one as well .
in recent days , german government speaker bela anda has made much of the fact that only after schröder telephoned putin last week to express his hope that a solution would be found - " and not before " - did putin agree to cooperate " with any elected ukrainian president . "
the comment clearly implied that schröder 's intervention had been crucial .
and on tuesday , anda announced that schröder and putin had agreed that the outcome of any new presidential election in ukraine " must be strictly respected . "
meanwhile , however , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens has adopted a sharper tone , putting yet more pressure on the chancellor .
over the weekend , fischer described the ukrainian parliament 's decision to annul the results of the election as an important step " to allow the will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people to be respected . "
pipelines are key alexander rahr of the german council on foreign relations predicted that in the difficult days to come , germany is going to have to involve itself more deeply in the ukrainian crisis in a mediating role which could help it preserve its relationship and economic ties with russia , especially in the energy sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas from russia is piped to germany via ukraine .
here , a portion of the pipe is being built near halle .
the fact , for instance , that pipelines from russia to germany pass through ukraine only increase its importance to berlin , rahr said .
in response to the pressure , politicians in schröder 's own party have begun making comments aimed at playing up the chancellor 's pro-democratic position .
on monday , for instance , the german government once again called for a peaceful and constitutional solution to the election debacle in ukraine .
government spokesman anda said it was absolutely necessary that " the crisis be solved in dialog . "
and foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner said it is important " that the unadulterated will of the democratic majority of the ukrainian people be brought to bear , " and that a " solution without violence " must be found . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kuchma for new election in ukraine outgoing president leonid kuchma said monday that he was in favor of staging new elections in ukraine to resolve a bitter dispute over a nov .

up until now , studies have relied on clinical specimens or materials from people infected with the virus because it has not been possible to grow noroviruses in cell culture .
outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis are common in environments where there is confined contact between large numbers of people - such as in hospitals , nursing homes , schools and cruise ships .
the virus is passed through infected faeces and vomit .

dr skip virgin and colleagues were able to grow a version of the virus inside cells from mice .
by looking at the mouse virus , they were able to identify the part that is essential to its ability to cause disease .
this was the virus ' protein shell called the capsid .
" if this part of the capsid has an equivalent in human noroviruses , altering or disabling it may give us a way to produce forms of the viruses that are weak enough to serve as vaccines , " said dr virgin .

although rarely life threatening , there is currently no effective treatment for norovirus .
up to 1m people catch this stomach bug each year in the uk .
it has caused some hospital wards to close temporarily .
washington university researchers were the first to successfully grow the virus in the lab for testing .
this is a significant advance , even though it is in mice professor ian clarke virology professor southampton university this should make it much easier to learn about the virus and develop ways of combating the disease with antiviral treatments and vaccines , the scientists hope .
up until now , studies have relied on clinical specimens or materials from people infected with the virus because it has not been possible to grow noroviruses in cell culture .
outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis are common in environments where there is confined contact between large numbers of people - such as in hospitals , nursing homes , schools and cruise ships .
the virus is passed through infected faeces and vomit .
winter outbreaks good hygiene can help stop the virus from spreading , but it is difficult to contain .
dr skip virgin and colleagues were able to grow a version of the virus inside cells from mice .
by looking at the mouse virus , they were able to identify the part that is essential to its ability to cause disease .
this was the virus ' protein shell called the capsid .
" if this part of the capsid has an equivalent in human noroviruses , altering or disabling it may give us a way to produce forms of the viruses that are weak enough to serve as vaccines , " said dr virgin .
the researchers believe cells within the human gut are the site where the virus enters the body to cause disease .
they will publish their findings in the journal public library of science - biology .
' holy grail ' professor ian clarke , professor of virology at southampton university , said : " it 's a brilliant discovery .
" the holy grail of that research is to grow the virus in cell culture because that 's the real breakthrough that allows you to understand more about how the virus works .

" it is a model with which to work out how to study the human virus .
" ultimately , it could lead to the development of antiviral treatments and perhaps vaccines .
that 's a long way off . "
so far this year , including the winter months at the start of the year , there have been 160 outbreaks of infectious gastroenteritis due to norovirus , compared to 220 outbreaks in the whole of 2003 , according to the uk 's health protection agency .
a spokesman from the hpa said : " the identification of a mouse norovirus and a culture system in which it grows offers insights into the cultivation of human noroviruses .
it will allow work on the effects of disinfectants , cleaning regimes , antiviral drugs and possible vaccine candidates to be accelerated . "

yesterday we reported on the latest scam in which a computer user 's internet dialler is diverted to a premium rate or international number .
you only find out you 've been affected when suddenly a massive phone bill drops on your door mat .
breakfast 's max foster reported on the story for breakfast .
we 've had an overwhelming response from you with e-mails texts and calls to the programme , so today robert freeman who presents the bbc 's click online programme offers some advice on what you can do to protect yourself .
apologies if you have been trying to access the above video clip , we have had technical problems but they 've now been fixed what are ' rogue diallers ' ?
these are small files which you may unwittingly or accidentally download on to your computer whilst browsing web pages .
the rogue dialler replaces the number you normally use for dial-up internet , with a premium rate number , or an international number , with very high charges .
the rogue dialler can disconnect you from your normal internet service provider -lrb- isp and dial the new number without you noticing .
some may also mute your modem volume so you can not hear them dialling .
how do i avoid them ?
rogue diallers normally force themselves onto your computer in what is called a ' drive-by download ' - a quick file transfer which can occur without you realising it .
usually a pop-up window appears on the screen which does n't disappear until you click a ' yes ' or ' ok ' button .
you should always be suspicious of unexpected install requests and you should avoid accepting a pop-up window without knowing what it does .
restart your computer if you can not get rid of it by closing the window or using the ' esc ' key .
what if i have broadband ?
broadband connections are not susceptible to rogue diallers as they do not use a dial up process to connect .
however , you should make sure that you do not leave a standard phone plugged into your computer when you are not using it .
what you can do when dialling , confirm the number on your screen is correct for your isp .
it is worth noting that apple mac computers are largely immune to this kind of attack , but if you have a mac , it 's good practice to check this number .
if you have windows , check your dial-up networking , or connections folders for any unrecognised internet connections and delete them .
turn off your computer when you are not using it .
this is good advice , even if you have so-called ' always-on ' broadband .
consider changing your web browser .
a popular new browser is firefox , which is less susceptible to security threats than internet explorer , the browser used by most people running windows .
it includes pop-up blocker , which will prevent most rogue diallers from loading .
there are links on the right of this page to all the companies mentioned in the next few paragraphs if you are using windows , make sure that you have the latest updates .
microsoft 's latest addition to windows xp includes several security features , one of which is a pop-up blocker .
if you use internet explorer , check your browser 's security settings by going to tools > internet options click on the security tab , and choose the ' medium ' security setting .
check your computer for rogue software by running a spyware search program , such as spybot search and destroy or ad-aware .
there are several other options available by searching the web .
ring your phone company and ask about barring for premium rate numbers and international calls .
there may be a cost for this .
check a premium rate number , and make a complaint to the regulator , icstis .

follow robert freeman 's advice and do n't get hi-jacked yesterday we reported on the latest scam in which a computer user 's internet dialler is diverted to a premium rate or international number .
you only find out you 've been affected when suddenly a massive phone bill drops on your door mat .
breakfast 's max foster reported on the story for breakfast .
we 've had an overwhelming response from you with e-mails texts and calls to the programme , so today robert freeman who presents the bbc 's click online programme offers some advice on what you can do to protect yourself .
click here for robert freeman 's advice on rogue diallers apologies if you have been trying to access the above video clip , we have had technical problems but they 've now been fixed what are ' rogue diallers ' ?
these are small files which you may unwittingly or accidentally download on to your computer whilst browsing web pages .
the rogue dialler replaces the number you normally use for dial-up internet , with a premium rate number , or an international number , with very high charges .
the rogue dialler can disconnect you from your normal internet service provider -lrb- isp and dial the new number without you noticing .
some may also mute your modem volume so you can not hear them dialling .
how do i avoid them ?
rogue diallers normally force themselves onto your computer in what is called a ' drive-by download ' - a quick file transfer which can occur without you realising it .
usually a pop-up window appears on the screen which does n't disappear until you click a ' yes ' or ' ok ' button .
you should always be suspicious of unexpected install requests and you should avoid accepting a pop-up window without knowing what it does .
restart your computer if you can not get rid of it by closing the window or using the ' esc ' key .
what if i have broadband ?
broadband connections are not susceptible to rogue diallers as they do not use a dial up process to connect .
however , you should make sure that you do not leave a standard phone plugged into your computer when you are not using it .
what you can do when dialling , confirm the number on your screen is correct for your isp .
it is worth noting that apple mac computers are largely immune to this kind of attack , but if you have a mac , it 's good practice to check this number .
if you have windows , check your dial-up networking , or connections folders for any unrecognised internet connections and delete them .
turn off your computer when you are not using it .
this is good advice , even if you have so-called ' always-on ' broadband .
consider changing your web browser .
a popular new browser is firefox , which is less susceptible to security threats than internet explorer , the browser used by most people running windows .
it includes pop-up blocker , which will prevent most rogue diallers from loading .
there are links on the right of this page to all the companies mentioned in the next few paragraphs if you are using windows , make sure that you have the latest updates .
microsoft 's latest addition to windows xp includes several security features , one of which is a pop-up blocker .
if you use internet explorer , check your browser 's security settings by going to tools > internet options click on the security tab , and choose the ' medium ' security setting .
check your computer for rogue software by running a spyware search program , such as spybot search and destroy or ad-aware .
there are several other options available by searching the web .
ring your phone company and ask about barring for premium rate numbers and international calls .
there may be a cost for this .
check a premium rate number , and make a complaint to the regulator , icstis .

these are small files which you may unwittingly or accidentally download on to your computer whilst browsing web pages .
the rogue dialler replaces the number you normally use for dial-up internet , with a premium rate number , or an international number , with very high charges .
the rogue dialler can disconnect you from your normal internet service provider -lrb- isp and dial the new number without you noticing .
some may also mute your modem volume so you can not hear them dialling .
how do i avoid them ?
rogue diallers normally force themselves onto your computer in what is called a ' drive-by download ' - a quick file transfer which can occur without you realising it .
usually a pop-up window appears on the screen which does n't disappear until you click a ' yes ' or ' ok ' button .
you should always be suspicious of unexpected install requests and you should avoid accepting a pop-up window without knowing what it does .
restart your computer if you can not get rid of it by closing the window or using the ' esc ' key .
what if i have broadband ?
broadband connections are not susceptible to rogue diallers as they do not use a dial up process to connect .
however , you should make sure that you do not leave a standard phone plugged into your computer when you are not using it .
what you can do when dialling , confirm the number on your screen is correct for your isp .
it is worth noting that apple mac computers are largely immune to this kind of attack , but if you have a mac , it 's good practice to check this number .
if you have windows , check your dial-up networking , or connections folders for any unrecognised internet connections and delete them .
turn off your computer when you are not using it .
this is good advice , even if you have so-called ' always-on ' broadband .
consider changing your web browser .
a popular new browser is firefox , which is less susceptible to security threats than internet explorer , the browser used by most people running windows .
it includes pop-up blocker , which will prevent most rogue diallers from loading .
there are links on the right of this page to all the companies mentioned in the next few paragraphs if you are using windows , make sure that you have the latest updates .
microsoft 's latest addition to windows xp includes several security features , one of which is a pop-up blocker .
if you use internet explorer , check your browser 's security settings by going to tools > internet options click on the security tab , and choose the ' medium ' security setting .
check your computer for rogue software by running a spyware search program , such as spybot search and destroy or ad-aware .
there are several other options available by searching the web .
ring your phone company and ask about barring for premium rate numbers and international calls .
there may be a cost for this .
check a premium rate number , and make a complaint to the regulator , icstis .

production dropped 1.6 % in october , reflecting a decline in exports , while unemployment levels edged up 0.1 % to 4.7 % , slightly higher than forecast .
the economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand .
japan 's government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand .
adjustment analysts had been forecasting a 0.1 % rise in month on month industrial output .
it is a sign that the economy 's adjustment phase is stronger than expected takashi yamanaka , according to figures from the ministry of economy , trade and industry -lrb- meti -rrb- , the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions .
although inventories fell 0.7 % month on month , they were 36 % higher than a year ago .
" it 's a sign that the economy 's adjustment phase is stronger than expected , " said takashi yamanaka , an economist with ufj bank .
japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year .
slowing growth growth slowed to 0.3 % in the quarter ending september 30 , down from 6.3 % in the first quarter of 2004 .
experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar .
japanese government officials played down the latest data , arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient .
" the outlook for november is positive so i do n't think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in october , " said a meti official .
despite the rise in unemployment , jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years .
the comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the nikkei down 1 % in afternoon trade .

slowing growth growth slowed to 0.3 % in the quarter ending september 30 , down from 6.3 % in the first quarter of 2004 .
experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar .
japanese government officials played down the latest data , arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient .
" the outlook for november is positive so i do n't think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in october , " said a meti official .
despite the rise in unemployment , jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years .
the comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the nikkei down 1 % in afternoon trade .

she works and campaigns for people infected with hiv / aids in africa through the aid and development agency world vision .
here she argues that we are failing a generation of women who are now on the frontline of the pandemic .
africa is in the death grip of hiv / aids and a generation of african girls is standing on the frontline of the carnage .
in the countries worst affected by hiv / aids , girls and women are infected at higher rates than boys and men - in some age groups , up to five times higher .
as a young zambian woman living with hiv , who has lost both her parents to aids and is working with people affected by the disease , the plight of the girls and their continued vulnerability is heartbreaking to me .
the latest unaids annual report only confirms what we know - aids is a female epidemic .
there are 39.4 million people living with hiv across the globe - and increasingly , those becoming newly infected are women .
while there is evidence that women are more biologically prone to infection , there are cultural norms which are greatly increasing their risk of infection .
while there has been an education revolution in many countries about the dangers of aids , there is evidence that even when girls are aware of the risks , it often does little to reduce their vulnerability .
gender inequality this alarming anomaly led world vision to pilot research in two african countries , tanzania and zambia , to discover why global efforts to increase awareness are failing to protect women from hiv / aids .
in tanzania , the prevalence rate for girls aged 15 to 19 is more than three times higher than for boys , and in zambia , it is higher still . "
to protect girls , the debate has to be broadened to tackle gender inequality , harmful cultural practices , discrimination and sexual violence " the research found that the abc -lrb- abstinence , be faithful and use condoms -rrb- strategy - which is a cornerstone of hiv / aids prevention efforts in many countries - does not protect girls and women .
it has failed because they have not been allowed by men to practise this strategy .
to fight aids successfully and to protect girls , the debate has to be broadened to tackle the issues of gender inequality , harmful cultural practices , discrimination and sexual violence .
by 2005 , governments should have strategies in place to protect women 's human rights and reduce their vulnerability to hiv / aids through eliminating abuse , rape , and female trafficking .
this was the target set back in 2001 by the un .
yet little progress has been made in countries where it is so desperately needed .
prevention strategies the sexual exploitation of girls is a significant factor in their vulnerability to hiv / aids .
girls who are orphaned or who are caring for parents living with aids are often responsible for meeting their families ' economic needs .
in many cases girls engage in " survival sex " to earn money or necessities such as food and school materials .
unicef estimates there are now 12.3 million children orphaned by aids in sub-saharan africa .
another factor multiplying the risk to girls is the rape of virgins by some hiv-positive men who believe that this will cure them of aids .
in cultural contexts where girls are largely monogamous but many boys are not , and where girls have little say in how and when they will practise sex , reliance on condoms as a preventative measure is not enough to reduce their vulnerability .
on the eve of world aids day , we should review our prevention strategies and ensure they include measures to expand the freedom of girls and women to negotiate their sexual activity , and engage boys and men in discussions about their assumptions regarding their own gender roles .

in the countries worst affected by hiv / aids , girls and women are infected at higher rates than boys and men - in some age groups , up to five times higher .
as a young zambian woman living with hiv , who has lost both her parents to aids and is working with people affected by the disease , the plight of the girls and their continued vulnerability is heartbreaking to me .
the latest unaids annual report only confirms what we know - aids is a female epidemic .
there are 39.4 million people living with hiv across the globe - and increasingly , those becoming newly infected are women .
while there is evidence that women are more biologically prone to infection , there are cultural norms which are greatly increasing their risk of infection .
while there has been an education revolution in many countries about the dangers of aids , there is evidence that even when girls are aware of the risks , it often does little to reduce their vulnerability .
gender inequality this alarming anomaly led world vision to pilot research in two african countries , tanzania and zambia , to discover why global efforts to increase awareness are failing to protect women from hiv / aids .
in tanzania , the prevalence rate for girls aged 15 to 19 is more than three times higher than for boys , and in zambia , it is higher still .
to protect girls , the debate has to be broadened to tackle gender inequality , harmful cultural practices , discrimination and sexual violence the research found that the abc -lrb- abstinence , be faithful and use condoms -rrb- strategy - which is a cornerstone of hiv / aids prevention efforts in many countries - does not protect girls and women .
it has failed because they have not been allowed by men to practise this strategy .
to fight aids successfully and to protect girls , the debate has to be broadened to tackle the issues of gender inequality , harmful cultural practices , discrimination and sexual violence .
by 2005 , governments should have strategies in place to protect women 's human rights and reduce their vulnerability to hiv / aids through eliminating abuse , rape , and female trafficking .
this was the target set back in 2001 by the un .
yet little progress has been made in countries where it is so desperately needed .
prevention strategies the sexual exploitation of girls is a significant factor in their vulnerability to hiv / aids .
girls who are orphaned or who are caring for parents living with aids are often responsible for meeting their families ' economic needs .
the burials of female aids victims are constant in africa in many cases girls engage in " survival sex " to earn money or necessities such as food and school materials .
unicef estimates there are now 12.3 million children orphaned by aids in sub-saharan africa .
another factor multiplying the risk to girls is the rape of virgins by some hiv-positive men who believe that this will cure them of aids .
in cultural contexts where girls are largely monogamous but many boys are not , and where girls have little say in how and when they will practise sex , reliance on condoms as a preventative measure is not enough to reduce their vulnerability .
on the eve of world aids day , we should review our prevention strategies and ensure they include measures to expand the freedom of girls and women to negotiate their sexual activity , and engage boys and men in discussions about their assumptions regarding their own gender roles .
