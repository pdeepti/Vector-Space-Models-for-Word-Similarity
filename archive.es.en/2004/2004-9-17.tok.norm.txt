that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .

rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .

polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .
" it 's a text all six countries can live with , " a diplomat close to the negotiations , which are still ongoing in vienna , told the reuters news agency . iran remains defiant this week , new evidence surfaced substantiating us claims that iran is in the process of building nuclear weapons .
a us nuclear monitor published satellite images of an iranian weapons facility , the parchin military complex southeast of tehran , which it said was being used for research and testing . iranian officials denied the charge and insisted that their country 's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful .
earlier this week , a defiant iranian official told reporters iran would resume uranium enrichment despite a promise made to european diplomats last october to suspend such activities . the new draft still has to be approved by the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders may get tough with iran as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line .
-lrb- september 13 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .
the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un .
-lrb- september 7 , 2004 -rrb- europe mum over next step on iran the us says it 's working with europe on a " tough set of resolutions " demanding iran 's compliance on the nuclear issue , but it 's not clear whether europe will abandon its engagement with iran to follow the us position .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences . " despite the criticism , audiences in germany and across europe are expected to flock to see the film in an attempt to get a glimpse of the man behind the monstrous myth . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de villainous typecasting ?

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .
" it 's a text all six countries can live with , " a diplomat close to the negotiations , which are still ongoing in vienna , told the reuters news agency . iran remains defiant this week , new evidence surfaced substantiating us claims that iran is in the process of building nuclear weapons .
a us nuclear monitor published satellite images of an iranian weapons facility , the parchin military complex southeast of tehran , which it said was being used for research and testing . iranian officials denied the charge and insisted that their country 's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful .
earlier this week , a defiant iranian official told reporters iran would resume uranium enrichment despite a promise made to european diplomats last october to suspend such activities . the new draft still has to be approved by the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders may get tough with iran as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

on the contrary , there are many particular characteristics that accentuate a partnership , " merkel wrote in the letter . she gave few details of the exact reasons for the cdu 's opposition to turkey being granted full membership , but she has said in the past that the country of 70 million inhabitants was not european enough in its customs and traditions . turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 and argues that it has met most of the criteria to begin membership talks .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , will release its report on turkey 's progress on democratic reform on october 6 , which will say whether it recommends opening accession talks . afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 spd braces for tough state polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard left and extreme right parties are poised to do well members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at the federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is likely to suffer heavy losses in the two eastern state polls this weekend . nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country .
that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .
19 elections .
" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .
" that 's something we have to prevent .

this week , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats wrote to the heads of conservative governments across europe to gather support for her party 's opposition to turkish eu membership . a spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel confirmed a report in die welt newspaper on thursday , which said that merkel had written a letter to the heads of conservative european governments calling for a special relationship between turkey and the european union - but not full membership . the center-left government of german chancellor gerhard schröder , in contrast , has strongly supported turkey 's bid for eu bid , although foreign minister joschka fischer said this month that the mainly muslim nation was not yet ready . merkel on the offensive merkel said she hoped her letter would encourage other european conservatives to back the cdu 's position . " through this letter i would like your parties to once again consider this concept and adopt this attempt at a solution , " said an extract of the letter printed in die welt . merkel said turkey " was following the path of a remarkable program of reforms , which we must support " and stressed the country 's importance as a " nato partner and also as a model of a secular , democratic state in the islamic world " . among the recipients of the letter were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and his french counterpart jean-pierre raffarin . partnership yes , membership no " turkey should not be turned away .
on the contrary , there are many particular characteristics that accentuate a partnership , " merkel wrote in the letter . she gave few details of the exact reasons for the cdu 's opposition to turkey being granted full membership , but she has said in the past that the country of 70 million inhabitants was not european enough in its customs and traditions . turkey has been an eu candidate since 1999 and argues that it has met most of the criteria to begin membership talks .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , will release its report on turkey 's progress on democratic reform on october 6 , which will say whether it recommends opening accession talks . afp -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 town struggles with far-right extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from afar , idyllic eberswalde does n't look like an extremist haven economic woes may improve the position of the far-right german people ’ s union in brandenburg 's state elections sunday .
high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ . " " there may be some expressed criticism or frustration , but that is almost secondary to the notion that there is a due process , there is a way of doing business , " ridge said .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .

" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

“ today , the coffee tastes good , ” said barbara schimmelpfennig , press spokeswoman for gepa , europe ’ s largest fair trade company based in wuppertal .
“ after all , people are not going to buy a product just out of pity , ” she told dw-world .
fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .

schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ .

" ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .

schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- .

-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences . " despite the criticism , audiences in germany and across europe are expected to flock to see the film in an attempt to get a glimpse of the man behind the monstrous myth . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de villainous typecasting ?

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .

the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .

a us nuclear monitor published satellite images of an iranian weapons facility , the parchin military complex southeast of tehran , which it said was being used for research and testing . iranian officials denied the charge and insisted that their country 's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful .
earlier this week , a defiant iranian official told reporters iran would resume uranium enrichment despite a promise made to european diplomats last october to suspend such activities . the new draft still has to be approved by the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders may get tough with iran as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .

19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 spd braces for tough state polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard left and extreme right parties are poised to do well members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at the federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is likely to suffer heavy losses in the two eastern state polls this weekend . nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country .
that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .

" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "

the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ . " " there may be some expressed criticism or frustration , but that is almost secondary to the notion that there is a due process , there is a way of doing business , " ridge said .
" we just accept it . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror two weeks after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 spd braces for tough state polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard left and extreme right parties are poised to do well members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at the federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is likely to suffer heavy losses in the two eastern state polls this weekend . nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country .
that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .
19 elections .
" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .
" that 's something we have to prevent .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 town struggles with far-right extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from afar , idyllic eberswalde does n't look like an extremist haven economic woes may improve the position of the far-right german people ’ s union in brandenburg 's state elections sunday .
high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences . " despite the criticism , audiences in germany and across europe are expected to flock to see the film in an attempt to get a glimpse of the man behind the monstrous myth . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de villainous typecasting ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 spd braces for tough state polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard left and extreme right parties are poised to do well members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at the federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is likely to suffer heavy losses in the two eastern state polls this weekend . nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country .
that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .
19 elections .
" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

the campaign aims to promote fairer world trade and more conscious consumer behavior . back in the 1970s and 1980s , alternative-minded germans bought nicaraguan coffee out of conviction and solidarity .
it was considered politically correct and hip to choose fair- trade products .
but taste was another matter .
the bitter beans from latin america left much to be desired .
a lot has changed since then , both in taste and in the acceptance of fair trade products .
“ today , the coffee tastes good , ” said barbara schimmelpfennig , press spokeswoman for gepa , europe ’ s largest fair trade company based in wuppertal .
“ after all , people are not going to buy a product just out of pity , ” she told dw-world .
fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .
producers are given guaranteed long-term trade relations , and can even have their harvests pre-financed .
the goods , for example coffee , are delivered to importers , in this case coffee roasters , who deal with the marketing .
producers and importers are strictly controlled and licensed .
germany ’ s faire woche or fair trade week , wants to draw more consumers into the world of fair traded products .
beginning september 20 , supermarkets , world shops , private and public organizations across the country will be hosting nearly 1,000 events .
celebrities will be eating fair-traded products at breakfasts in public places .
world shops and company canteens are planning special promotions and a fair trade commercial will air in 300 movie theaters .
fairness in your shopping basket “ fair trade gives everyone the opportunity to get involved in battling poverty and ensuring a fair structure in global trade , ” said federal development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is the patron for the faire woche .
“ with this week , we want to inform the public of the social background and principles of fair trade . ”
informing consumers is a top priority for the organizers , too . " we don ’ t have the financial means to do widespread television advertising , for example , ” said gepa ’ s schimmelpfennig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faire woche " or fair trade week aims to inform more consumers about the benefits of this sector .
“ there are still not enough consumers who know about fair products , " she said .
" that is why a campaign like the fair trade week is so important for us . ”
wieczorek-zeul agreed .
“ a lot of people in germany would like to buy fair products if they knew more about them and they were offered more widely , ” she said .
for almost 30 years , products from fair trade have been available in over 800 shops in germany .
the spectrum ranges from foods , such as coffee , tea , bananas and honey , to soccer balls , handicrafts and musical instruments .
a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .
but removing them from our range for this reason is not at all under consideration . ”
figures from the consumer organization verbraucher initiative show that the market share of products from fair trade does not exceed one percent in any segment of the respective market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee producers especially benefit from fair trade .
even the top seller fair coffee only reaches a market share of 0.7 percent in germany .
still , gepa has seen strong growth in supermarket sales .
in the financial year ending march 31 , 2004 , gepa product turnover via supermarkets was up 16 percent to € 6 million -lrb- $ 7.3 million -rrb- .
“ this is a hard-fought sector , ” said schimmelpfennig .
“ so this increase is a real accomplishment . ”
an imbalanced world economy “ fair trade points out how imbalanced and in need of reform the global economic relations still are , ” said wieczorek-zeul .
“ developing countries need a fair chance to evolve out of their own potential - and in order to do this , they need wide access to our markets . ”
according to schimmelpfennig , this political endorsement is indicative of fair trade ’ s development .
“ years ago , we didn ’ t have this support , ” she said .
“ now , what began as something ethical has gained an economic and political level . ”

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences . " despite the criticism , audiences in germany and across europe are expected to flock to see the film in an attempt to get a glimpse of the man behind the monstrous myth . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de villainous typecasting ?

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ . " " there may be some expressed criticism or frustration , but that is almost secondary to the notion that there is a due process , there is a way of doing business , " ridge said .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .

schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 town struggles with far-right extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from afar , idyllic eberswalde does n't look like an extremist haven economic woes may improve the position of the far-right german people ’ s union in brandenburg 's state elections sunday .
high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 spd braces for tough state polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard left and extreme right parties are poised to do well members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at the federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is likely to suffer heavy losses in the two eastern state polls this weekend . nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country .
that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.09.2004 eu to head peacekeeping in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will take over peacekeeping reins from nato in bosnia the european union announced friday it plans to replace nato 's peacekeeping troops with its own in bosnia-herzegovina at the end of the year , as part of a new eu paramilitary force . eu defense ministers will be discussing the plan submitted by admiral rainer feist , military chief of the eu mission as well as deputy supreme commander of nato 's armed forces , during a meeting in noordwijk in the netherlands this week .
the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 town struggles with far-right extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from afar , idyllic eberswalde does n't look like an extremist haven economic woes may improve the position of the far-right german people ’ s union in brandenburg 's state elections sunday .
high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .

upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .

earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .

hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .
19 elections .
" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .
" that 's something we have to prevent .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .
" it 's a text all six countries can live with , " a diplomat close to the negotiations , which are still ongoing in vienna , told the reuters news agency . iran remains defiant this week , new evidence surfaced substantiating us claims that iran is in the process of building nuclear weapons .
a us nuclear monitor published satellite images of an iranian weapons facility , the parchin military complex southeast of tehran , which it said was being used for research and testing . iranian officials denied the charge and insisted that their country 's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful .
earlier this week , a defiant iranian official told reporters iran would resume uranium enrichment despite a promise made to european diplomats last october to suspend such activities . the new draft still has to be approved by the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders may get tough with iran as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .

schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .

-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ . " " there may be some expressed criticism or frustration , but that is almost secondary to the notion that there is a due process , there is a way of doing business , " ridge said .
" we just accept it . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror two weeks after the sept .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences . " despite the criticism , audiences in germany and across europe are expected to flock to see the film in an attempt to get a glimpse of the man behind the monstrous myth . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de villainous typecasting ?

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator .

the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.09.2004 eu to head peacekeeping in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will take over peacekeeping reins from nato in bosnia the european union announced friday it plans to replace nato 's peacekeeping troops with its own in bosnia-herzegovina at the end of the year , as part of a new eu paramilitary force . eu defense ministers will be discussing the plan submitted by admiral rainer feist , military chief of the eu mission as well as deputy supreme commander of nato 's armed forces , during a meeting in noordwijk in the netherlands this week .
the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .
" it 's a text all six countries can live with , " a diplomat close to the negotiations , which are still ongoing in vienna , told the reuters news agency . iran remains defiant this week , new evidence surfaced substantiating us claims that iran is in the process of building nuclear weapons .
a us nuclear monitor published satellite images of an iranian weapons facility , the parchin military complex southeast of tehran , which it said was being used for research and testing . iranian officials denied the charge and insisted that their country 's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful .
earlier this week , a defiant iranian official told reporters iran would resume uranium enrichment despite a promise made to european diplomats last october to suspend such activities . the new draft still has to be approved by the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders may get tough with iran as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line .
-lrb- september 13 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .
the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un .
-lrb- september 7 , 2004 -rrb- europe mum over next step on iran the us says it 's working with europe on a " tough set of resolutions " demanding iran 's compliance on the nuclear issue , but it 's not clear whether europe will abandon its engagement with iran to follow the us position .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .
" it 's a text all six countries can live with , " a diplomat close to the negotiations , which are still ongoing in vienna , told the reuters news agency . iran remains defiant this week , new evidence surfaced substantiating us claims that iran is in the process of building nuclear weapons .
a us nuclear monitor published satellite images of an iranian weapons facility , the parchin military complex southeast of tehran , which it said was being used for research and testing . iranian officials denied the charge and insisted that their country 's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful .
earlier this week , a defiant iranian official told reporters iran would resume uranium enrichment despite a promise made to european diplomats last october to suspend such activities . the new draft still has to be approved by the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders may get tough with iran as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line .
-lrb- september 13 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .
the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un .
-lrb- september 7 , 2004 -rrb- europe mum over next step on iran the us says it 's working with europe on a " tough set of resolutions " demanding iran 's compliance on the nuclear issue , but it 's not clear whether europe will abandon its engagement with iran to follow the us position .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

it was considered politically correct and hip to choose fair- trade products .
but taste was another matter .
the bitter beans from latin america left much to be desired .
a lot has changed since then , both in taste and in the acceptance of fair trade products .
“ today , the coffee tastes good , ” said barbara schimmelpfennig , press spokeswoman for gepa , europe ’ s largest fair trade company based in wuppertal .
“ after all , people are not going to buy a product just out of pity , ” she told dw-world .
fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .
producers are given guaranteed long-term trade relations , and can even have their harvests pre-financed .
the goods , for example coffee , are delivered to importers , in this case coffee roasters , who deal with the marketing .
producers and importers are strictly controlled and licensed .
germany ’ s faire woche or fair trade week , wants to draw more consumers into the world of fair traded products .

world shops and company canteens are planning special promotions and a fair trade commercial will air in 300 movie theaters .
fairness in your shopping basket “ fair trade gives everyone the opportunity to get involved in battling poverty and ensuring a fair structure in global trade , ” said federal development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is the patron for the faire woche .
“ with this week , we want to inform the public of the social background and principles of fair trade . ”
informing consumers is a top priority for the organizers , too . " we don ’ t have the financial means to do widespread television advertising , for example , ” said gepa ’ s schimmelpfennig .

“ there are still not enough consumers who know about fair products , " she said .
" that is why a campaign like the fair trade week is so important for us . ”
wieczorek-zeul agreed .
“ a lot of people in germany would like to buy fair products if they knew more about them and they were offered more widely , ” she said .
for almost 30 years , products from fair trade have been available in over 800 shops in germany .
the spectrum ranges from foods , such as coffee , tea , bananas and honey , to soccer balls , handicrafts and musical instruments .
a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .
but removing them from our range for this reason is not at all under consideration . ”

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .

" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .

in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .

the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .
punishing the politicians in better economic times , many with right-wing sentiments would cast their votes for conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but hard times bring out people 's desire to punish politicians , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls show jörg schönbohm -lrb- cdu -rrb- in third place but politicians are n't the only ones being targeted by extremists .
earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .
hard core remains intact town counselors agree the times when far-right radicals could turn neighborhoods into no-go areas for foreigners are over , yet hard-core cells are still very much intact , and officials are n't sure how to stop them .
" to actively try to get right wing extremists into the center of democratic society , i think that 's too ambitious , " said julia plessing , a member of a local civil group against extremism .
brandenburg ’ s cdu hopeful , ex-general jörg schönbohm -lrb- photo -rrb- , also finds it too ambitious to deal with the german people ’ s union ’ s arguments in the current election campaign .
showing the absurdity of their slogans , some of which call for " german money for germans only , " would just take too long , he said . hardy graupner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd braces for tough state polls members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections .

this week , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats wrote to the heads of conservative governments across europe to gather support for her party 's opposition to turkish eu membership . a spokesman for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel confirmed a report in die welt newspaper on thursday , which said that merkel had written a letter to the heads of conservative european governments calling for a special relationship between turkey and the european union - but not full membership . the center-left government of german chancellor gerhard schröder , in contrast , has strongly supported turkey 's bid for eu bid , although foreign minister joschka fischer said this month that the mainly muslim nation was not yet ready . merkel on the offensive merkel said she hoped her letter would encourage other european conservatives to back the cdu 's position . " through this letter i would like your parties to once again consider this concept and adopt this attempt at a solution , " said an extract of the letter printed in die welt . merkel said turkey " was following the path of a remarkable program of reforms , which we must support " and stressed the country 's importance as a " nato partner and also as a model of a secular , democratic state in the islamic world " . among the recipients of the letter were italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and his french counterpart jean-pierre raffarin . partnership yes , membership no " turkey should not be turned away .

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .

" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "

rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .

we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "

the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 a week of fairness for fair trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this coffee farmer will receive a fair price for her beans next week , celebrities across germany will be publicly sipping fair traded coffee during fair trade week .
the campaign aims to promote fairer world trade and more conscious consumer behavior . back in the 1970s and 1980s , alternative-minded germans bought nicaraguan coffee out of conviction and solidarity .
it was considered politically correct and hip to choose fair- trade products .
but taste was another matter .
the bitter beans from latin america left much to be desired .
a lot has changed since then , both in taste and in the acceptance of fair trade products .
“ today , the coffee tastes good , ” said barbara schimmelpfennig , press spokeswoman for gepa , europe ’ s largest fair trade company based in wuppertal .
“ after all , people are not going to buy a product just out of pity , ” she told dw-world .
fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .
producers are given guaranteed long-term trade relations , and can even have their harvests pre-financed .
the goods , for example coffee , are delivered to importers , in this case coffee roasters , who deal with the marketing .
producers and importers are strictly controlled and licensed .
germany ’ s faire woche or fair trade week , wants to draw more consumers into the world of fair traded products .
beginning september 20 , supermarkets , world shops , private and public organizations across the country will be hosting nearly 1,000 events .
celebrities will be eating fair-traded products at breakfasts in public places .
world shops and company canteens are planning special promotions and a fair trade commercial will air in 300 movie theaters .
fairness in your shopping basket “ fair trade gives everyone the opportunity to get involved in battling poverty and ensuring a fair structure in global trade , ” said federal development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is the patron for the faire woche .
“ with this week , we want to inform the public of the social background and principles of fair trade . ”
informing consumers is a top priority for the organizers , too . " we don ’ t have the financial means to do widespread television advertising , for example , ” said gepa ’ s schimmelpfennig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faire woche " or fair trade week aims to inform more consumers about the benefits of this sector .
“ there are still not enough consumers who know about fair products , " she said .
" that is why a campaign like the fair trade week is so important for us . ”
wieczorek-zeul agreed .
“ a lot of people in germany would like to buy fair products if they knew more about them and they were offered more widely , ” she said .
for almost 30 years , products from fair trade have been available in over 800 shops in germany .
the spectrum ranges from foods , such as coffee , tea , bananas and honey , to soccer balls , handicrafts and musical instruments .
a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .
but removing them from our range for this reason is not at all under consideration . ”
figures from the consumer organization verbraucher initiative show that the market share of products from fair trade does not exceed one percent in any segment of the respective market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee producers especially benefit from fair trade .
even the top seller fair coffee only reaches a market share of 0.7 percent in germany .
still , gepa has seen strong growth in supermarket sales .
in the financial year ending march 31 , 2004 , gepa product turnover via supermarkets was up 16 percent to € 6 million -lrb- $ 7.3 million -rrb- .
“ this is a hard-fought sector , ” said schimmelpfennig .
“ so this increase is a real accomplishment . ”
an imbalanced world economy “ fair trade points out how imbalanced and in need of reform the global economic relations still are , ” said wieczorek-zeul .
“ developing countries need a fair chance to evolve out of their own potential - and in order to do this , they need wide access to our markets . ”
according to schimmelpfennig , this political endorsement is indicative of fair trade ’ s development .
“ years ago , we didn ’ t have this support , ” she said .
“ now , what began as something ethical has gained an economic and political level . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , center , enjoys a " fair " breakfast in berlin .
fair trade week doesn ’ t just appeal to our conscience , though , but also to our taste buds , said wieczorek-zeul .

in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.09.2004 eu to head peacekeeping in bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will take over peacekeeping reins from nato in bosnia the european union announced friday it plans to replace nato 's peacekeeping troops with its own in bosnia-herzegovina at the end of the year , as part of a new eu paramilitary force . eu defense ministers will be discussing the plan submitted by admiral rainer feist , military chief of the eu mission as well as deputy supreme commander of nato 's armed forces , during a meeting in noordwijk in the netherlands this week .
the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .
nato will also continue to hunt for war criminals . bernd riegert -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu defense ministers plan new paramilitary force at friday 's meeting in the dutch town of noordwij , eu defense ministers will announce the creation of an eu paramilitary force to help with peacekeeping .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 spd braces for tough state polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard left and extreme right parties are poised to do well members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at the federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is likely to suffer heavy losses in the two eastern state polls this weekend . nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country .
that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .
19 elections .
" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .
" that 's something we have to prevent .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ . " " there may be some expressed criticism or frustration , but that is almost secondary to the notion that there is a due process , there is a way of doing business , " ridge said .
" we just accept it . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror two weeks after the sept .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 a week of fairness for fair trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this coffee farmer will receive a fair price for her beans next week , celebrities across germany will be publicly sipping fair traded coffee during fair trade week .
the campaign aims to promote fairer world trade and more conscious consumer behavior . back in the 1970s and 1980s , alternative-minded germans bought nicaraguan coffee out of conviction and solidarity .
it was considered politically correct and hip to choose fair- trade products .
but taste was another matter .
the bitter beans from latin america left much to be desired .
a lot has changed since then , both in taste and in the acceptance of fair trade products .
“ today , the coffee tastes good , ” said barbara schimmelpfennig , press spokeswoman for gepa , europe ’ s largest fair trade company based in wuppertal .
“ after all , people are not going to buy a product just out of pity , ” she told dw-world .
fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .
producers are given guaranteed long-term trade relations , and can even have their harvests pre-financed .
the goods , for example coffee , are delivered to importers , in this case coffee roasters , who deal with the marketing .
producers and importers are strictly controlled and licensed .
germany ’ s faire woche or fair trade week , wants to draw more consumers into the world of fair traded products .
beginning september 20 , supermarkets , world shops , private and public organizations across the country will be hosting nearly 1,000 events .
celebrities will be eating fair-traded products at breakfasts in public places .
world shops and company canteens are planning special promotions and a fair trade commercial will air in 300 movie theaters .
fairness in your shopping basket “ fair trade gives everyone the opportunity to get involved in battling poverty and ensuring a fair structure in global trade , ” said federal development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is the patron for the faire woche .
“ with this week , we want to inform the public of the social background and principles of fair trade . ”
informing consumers is a top priority for the organizers , too . " we don ’ t have the financial means to do widespread television advertising , for example , ” said gepa ’ s schimmelpfennig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faire woche " or fair trade week aims to inform more consumers about the benefits of this sector .
“ there are still not enough consumers who know about fair products , " she said .
" that is why a campaign like the fair trade week is so important for us . ”
wieczorek-zeul agreed .
“ a lot of people in germany would like to buy fair products if they knew more about them and they were offered more widely , ” she said .
for almost 30 years , products from fair trade have been available in over 800 shops in germany .
the spectrum ranges from foods , such as coffee , tea , bananas and honey , to soccer balls , handicrafts and musical instruments .
a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .
but removing them from our range for this reason is not at all under consideration . ”
figures from the consumer organization verbraucher initiative show that the market share of products from fair trade does not exceed one percent in any segment of the respective market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee producers especially benefit from fair trade .
even the top seller fair coffee only reaches a market share of 0.7 percent in germany .
still , gepa has seen strong growth in supermarket sales .
in the financial year ending march 31 , 2004 , gepa product turnover via supermarkets was up 16 percent to € 6 million -lrb- $ 7.3 million -rrb- .
“ this is a hard-fought sector , ” said schimmelpfennig .
“ so this increase is a real accomplishment . ”
an imbalanced world economy “ fair trade points out how imbalanced and in need of reform the global economic relations still are , ” said wieczorek-zeul .
“ developing countries need a fair chance to evolve out of their own potential - and in order to do this , they need wide access to our markets . ”
according to schimmelpfennig , this political endorsement is indicative of fair trade ’ s development .
“ years ago , we didn ’ t have this support , ” she said .
“ now , what began as something ethical has gained an economic and political level . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , center , enjoys a " fair " breakfast in berlin .
fair trade week doesn ’ t just appeal to our conscience , though , but also to our taste buds , said wieczorek-zeul .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ . " " there may be some expressed criticism or frustration , but that is almost secondary to the notion that there is a due process , there is a way of doing business , " ridge said .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .

the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .

earlier this week in eberswalde , swastikas were painted on a gravestone of an african who was killed by a right-wing mob in the early 1990s , and special police forces seized inflammatory far-right music collections in the neighboring state of saxony last week .

high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .
" it 's a text all six countries can live with , " a diplomat close to the negotiations , which are still ongoing in vienna , told the reuters news agency . iran remains defiant this week , new evidence surfaced substantiating us claims that iran is in the process of building nuclear weapons .
a us nuclear monitor published satellite images of an iranian weapons facility , the parchin military complex southeast of tehran , which it said was being used for research and testing . iranian officials denied the charge and insisted that their country 's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful .
earlier this week , a defiant iranian official told reporters iran would resume uranium enrichment despite a promise made to european diplomats last october to suspend such activities . the new draft still has to be approved by the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders may get tough with iran as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line .
-lrb- september 13 , 2004 -rrb- iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .
the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un .
-lrb- september 7 , 2004 -rrb- europe mum over next step on iran the us says it 's working with europe on a " tough set of resolutions " demanding iran 's compliance on the nuclear issue , but it 's not clear whether europe will abandon its engagement with iran to follow the us position .

by allowing some tough wording , the eu is backing away from its previous policy of constructive engagement . the united states and the eu have agreed on a draft resolution calling on iran to give up its nuclear weapons program or suffer the consequences , according to information obtained on thursday from diplomats close to the negotiations . by agreeing to a much tougher resolution containing a time limit , something the us has been pushing for , the eu 's " big three " , france , britain and germany , are adapting the united states ' hard line with iran and abandoning their own policy of " constructive engagement " . time limit , but no " trigger mechanism " the draft demands iran freeze all uranium enrichment activities and expresses serious concern that it has not heeded previous calls to do so .
the resolution also expresses alarm at iranian plans to process more than 40 tons of raw uranium into uranium hexafluoride , the feed stock for enrichment . most importantly , it calls on the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- director general , mohamed elbaradei , to submit a report on november 25 reviewing the past two years of investigations , effectively setting the stage for a november showdown . however , the draft does not contain so-called trigger mechanisms , which would see the matter referred to the united nations security council , the international body empowered to impose sanctions , should the stubborn aspiring nuclear power fail to comply .
but it does keep open the option of " further steps " . though the europeans agreed to much tougher wording , the draft is still a compromise .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .
the european union , which will not have its own troops , will sort of " borrow " personnel and equipment from nato .
" it 's really simple , " feist said .
" nato headquarters , called shape which is responsible for all nato operations , will simply take over a further operation for the eu , " he said .
any other solution would be simply too expensive and illogical , since most of eu nations are also nato members , said admiral feist .
he added that parallel structures would simply be superfluous . sarajevo welcomes plan according to feist , politicians in sarajevo are quite happy with the plan , particularly because they feel it could help them eventually get their foot in the eu door .
althea will be the eu 's third military action , after a police mission in macedonia and a brief stint in congo .
the perfect task for a combined police and military mission to bosnia is to maintain stability in the country and make sure internal structures take shape as they should , noted feist .
the number of the troops is said to be reduced from 9,000 soldiers to 7,000 .
furthermore , a uniform army for all three ethnic groups - bosnian muslim , croatians , and serbs - is supposed to be created , a small nato office , which will help bosnian officials to build up their military will remain in sarajevo .

the troops will be deployed for peacekeeping missions in volatile regions recovering from war like the balkans .
they will not be used in conflict zones .
after nine years of peacekeeping in bosnia-herzegovina , nato will end its mission there in december 2004 . however , not all of the soldiers from nato 's sfor stabilization force will actually leave the region .
most of them will just gain a new insignia entitled " althea " , the name of the military and police mission , expected to include a couple of hundred soldiers , that will be directed by the european union . it will mark the largest-ever military deployment of the eu .
collaboration between nato and eu admiral feist said that the most obvious change would come about when the americans , currently stationed in tuzla with their own task force , would withdraw a large section of their troops .
" troops from different countries led by finland will be deployed there .
beyond that , it 's up to the individual countries to decide what will change for their contingents , " the admiral said , speaking at nato headquarters in mons , belgium .
with the new plan , all that will change in bosnia is a shift in political responsibility , according to feist .

“ today , the coffee tastes good , ” said barbara schimmelpfennig , press spokeswoman for gepa , europe ’ s largest fair trade company based in wuppertal .
“ after all , people are not going to buy a product just out of pity , ” she told dw-world .
fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .
producers are given guaranteed long-term trade relations , and can even have their harvests pre-financed .
the goods , for example coffee , are delivered to importers , in this case coffee roasters , who deal with the marketing .

“ there are still not enough consumers who know about fair products , " she said .
" that is why a campaign like the fair trade week is so important for us . ”
wieczorek-zeul agreed .
“ a lot of people in germany would like to buy fair products if they knew more about them and they were offered more widely , ” she said .
for almost 30 years , products from fair trade have been available in over 800 shops in germany .
the spectrum ranges from foods , such as coffee , tea , bananas and honey , to soccer balls , handicrafts and musical instruments .
a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .

“ developing countries need a fair chance to evolve out of their own potential - and in order to do this , they need wide access to our markets . ”
according to schimmelpfennig , this political endorsement is indicative of fair trade ’ s development .
“ years ago , we didn ’ t have this support , ” she said .

fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .
producers are given guaranteed long-term trade relations , and can even have their harvests pre-financed .
the goods , for example coffee , are delivered to importers , in this case coffee roasters , who deal with the marketing .

a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .

a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .
but removing them from our range for this reason is not at all under consideration . ”
figures from the consumer organization verbraucher initiative show that the market share of products from fair trade does not exceed one percent in any segment of the respective market .

“ developing countries need a fair chance to evolve out of their own potential - and in order to do this , they need wide access to our markets . ”
according to schimmelpfennig , this political endorsement is indicative of fair trade ’ s development .
“ years ago , we didn ’ t have this support , ” she said .
“ now , what began as something ethical has gained an economic and political level . ”

that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .

" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 spd braces for tough state polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hard left and extreme right parties are poised to do well members of chancellor schröder 's spd party in the german states of saxony and brandenburg fear voters are planning to vent their anger at the federal government 's economic reforms during this sunday 's local elections . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is likely to suffer heavy losses in the two eastern state polls this weekend . nationwide demonstrations taking place every monday against the government 's program of economic reforms and welfare cuts have been particularly strong in the formerly communist eastern half of the country .
that 's because labor market reforms that will soon go into effect have a proportionally bigger effect on the people in the economically depressed east , where unemployment is more than twice as high as in the west .
most opinion polls showing the spd will get hammered both in brandenburg and saxony to the benefit of the far-left pds party and smaller extreme right parties .
while the social democrats hope to hold on to power in brandeburg , they have no chance against the conservative opposition in saxony .
cdu successful in saxony seen as one of the most economically successful former east german states , the conservative christian democratic union has held control in saxony since german reunification in 1990 .
the spd earned just 11 percent of the vote - and its worst election defeat - in 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg milbradt expects his past success to help him to another term as hed of saxony " why lie about it ?
we 've had a lot of success , " the state 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- photo -rrb- put it succinctly .
" we have to do more , but it would be wrong to pretend nothing has happened . "
thanks in part to government investments , the area around saxony 's capital , dresden , has become an important location for micro-electronics and public funds have also convinced volkswagen , bmw and porsche to revitalize the saxon automobile industry .
pds stands to gain if there is any reason for the cdu to worry about its absolute majority in the saxon parliament , then it 's the party of democratic socialism , east germany 's former communist party , that 's posing the biggest threat .
the pds can count on 20 percent of the vote and probably could have had more if allegations its candidate used to be involved with the stasi , east germany 's former secret police , had not arisen .
" i think it is an unusual situation , " pds candidate peter porsch said .
" one thing i can say for sure is that i am going to lead this pds in the next parliament , whether it 's in the opposition or the government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pds has been using protests to show its displeasure with schröder 's government the pds is also strong in brandenburg , where dagmar enkelmann has high hopes for the party she 's leading into the sept .
19 elections .
" i want to become the state 's premier , " she said .
" there is finally a chance for a political change toward more social equality in this state . "
officials , however , believe brandenburg 's matthias platzeck -lrb- spd -rrb- , the state 's ruling premier and most popular politician , would rather continue to share power with the cdu , not the pds .
rise of the right the green party as well as the neo-liberal free democratic party could also garner more than the 5 percent of votes needed to enter the state parliaments in saxony as well as brandenburg .
but it 's the right-wing extremist parties that have caused the most commotion .
in saxony the neo-nazi national party -lrb- npd -rrb- is expected to earn around 10 percent of the vote and the populist , anti-immigrant german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- may get seats in brandenburg 's legislature .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the right-wing npd is taking advantage of labor reforms to push its extremist agenda in a state election earlier this month , the npd surpassed expectations by getting 4 percent of the vote in saarland , a western state where the party usually finds little resonance among voters .
the extremist parties ' rise in popularity has all the mainstream parties campaigning for citizens to exercise their right to vote , hoping to minimize the right-wing 's influence through high voter turnout .
" to get a stable government we need high voter turnout , because that 's the only guarantor that the extreme right wo n't be able to shape the state , " platzeck said .
" that 's something we have to prevent .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ .

but how best to do this ?
that 's where german interior minister otto schily and us homeland security secretary tom ridge do n't quite see eye to eye .
" there is a debate … whether we should create within the european union a kind of european secret service .
i find that rather too bold an idea , " schily said at a press conference in berlin after talks with ridge .
" so i 've argued that we should have a clearing house for europe in order to guarantee such an exchange -lrb- of information -rrb- . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily speaks in the german parliament , the bundestag , in berlin , thursday , dec .
13 , 2001 , during the debate on the new migration law .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- before meeting with ridge , schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said in an interview with the financial times deutschland that information sharing between the eu 's various national police and intelligence departments still leaves much to be desired . but schily said a " clearing house " function could be achieved by pooling information from all police and security sources across the eu at the bloc 's europol police agency .
intelligence analysis would be shared at a processing center in brussels .
eu interior and justice ministers are still discussing the issue , he added . us : clearing house wo n't work ridge was skeptical about the clearing house concept , and said he did n't think it would work on a global basis . " historically , countries have shared information on a bilateral basis , for many varied and good reasons , " he said .
" the notion that there will be a multilateral central clearing house where all information is shared with all countries is a concept that i do n't think , based on history , one could conclude would be the best way and the most appropriate way to share information . " ridge said that the us and germany had set up a working group to boost bilateral intelligence-sharing , and that some progress had been made in bilateral consultations on the introduction of biometric features such as fingerprints and iris scans for id cards and passports .
another working group will be dealing with ways of how to better protect infrastructure in both countries against terrorist attacks . ridge also spoke of his department ’ s efforts to strike the right balance between security concerns and the facilitation of business and academic travel between germany and the us .
it 's an issue that 's become a source of frustration among germans who need a visa to travel to the us , as new security measures have made the process more expensive and inconvenient .
starting on september 30 , all eu citizens who travel to the us under the so-called visa waiver program will also feel the effects of the new measures , as they 'll be fingerprinted and photographed . german terror trials hampered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq is pictured in a courtroom on the third day of motassadeq 's retrial in hamburg , northern germany .
schily and ridge also commented on the german trials of two men suspected of having helped the hamburg al qaeda terrorist cell plan the september 11 terrorist attacks .
schily expressed understanding for us reluctance to allow testimony from key al qaeda operatives in the trials of moroccans mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- and abdelghani mzoudi , but said he hoped " some of these obstacles can be cleared up . " motassadeq is being retried on more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a terrorist organization after an appeals court threw out his 2003 conviction , saying he was unfairly denied testimony from suspects in us custody .
the missing testimony was also a factor in february 's acquittal of mzoudi , who faced identical charges . despite expressions of regret from washington at the lack of a conviction in either trial , us authorities are still refusing to allow testimony from ramzi binalshibh , who is believed to have been the liaison between al qaeda and the hamburg cell . ridge noted that the us and germany " operate under the rule of law … and these rules may and do differ . " " there may be some expressed criticism or frustration , but that is almost secondary to the notion that there is a due process , there is a way of doing business , " ridge said .
" we just accept it . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de galvanized by madrid , europe moves against terror two weeks after the sept .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences . " despite the criticism , audiences in germany and across europe are expected to flock to see the film in an attempt to get a glimpse of the man behind the monstrous myth . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de villainous typecasting ?

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.09.2004 town struggles with far-right extremism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from afar , idyllic eberswalde does n't look like an extremist haven economic woes may improve the position of the far-right german people ’ s union in brandenburg 's state elections sunday .
high unemployment and the eu 's expansion have boosted extremist views in parts of the region . the town of eberswalde in the eastern german state of brandenburg , some 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- north-east of berlin , was once former east germany ’ s top sausage-producing center , but now it 's the service sector that is trying to keep the indebted community afloat after core industrial segments broke down .
in a state where unemployment hovers around 20 percent , eberswalde 's 44,000 people have a hard time finding jobs , making the town an ideal breeding ground for right-wing sentiments .
" make no mistake , the young people in this place are totally hooked on the far-right , " a supporter of the right-wing german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
another man nearby made no bones about how upset he is with policies the state 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- has put in place .
at least half of his friends who stayed in the area are unemployed and living on welfare , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's unemployment of 20 percent is among germany 's highest " finding a job in this place is next to impossible , " he added .
" you ’ d have to go bavaria , or switzerland , like so many have done . "
upset with established parties the dvu is trying to take advantage of people 's disenchantment with regional and national policies to earn votes in sept .
19 's state election .
polls show the dvu with between 5 percent and 6 percent of the vote , enough to hold on to its five seats in brandenburg 's parliament .
the party 's campaign ads feature a frustrated man who , after growling that he 's in debt and fed up with being unemployed , says he 's going to vote for the right-wing party as a way of punishing the political establishment .
" at the moment , when the trust to the established parties is gone , they change over to right-wing extremist parties , " dr. richard stöss , a local historian , told deutsche welle .

the campaign aims to promote fairer world trade and more conscious consumer behavior . back in the 1970s and 1980s , alternative-minded germans bought nicaraguan coffee out of conviction and solidarity .
it was considered politically correct and hip to choose fair- trade products .
but taste was another matter .
the bitter beans from latin america left much to be desired .
a lot has changed since then , both in taste and in the acceptance of fair trade products .
“ today , the coffee tastes good , ” said barbara schimmelpfennig , press spokeswoman for gepa , europe ’ s largest fair trade company based in wuppertal .
“ after all , people are not going to buy a product just out of pity , ” she told dw-world .
fair trade means that producers get a price for their goods , which lies above that paid on the world market .
producers are given guaranteed long-term trade relations , and can even have their harvests pre-financed .
the goods , for example coffee , are delivered to importers , in this case coffee roasters , who deal with the marketing .
producers and importers are strictly controlled and licensed .
germany ’ s faire woche or fair trade week , wants to draw more consumers into the world of fair traded products .
beginning september 20 , supermarkets , world shops , private and public organizations across the country will be hosting nearly 1,000 events .
celebrities will be eating fair-traded products at breakfasts in public places .
world shops and company canteens are planning special promotions and a fair trade commercial will air in 300 movie theaters .
fairness in your shopping basket “ fair trade gives everyone the opportunity to get involved in battling poverty and ensuring a fair structure in global trade , ” said federal development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , who is the patron for the faire woche .
“ with this week , we want to inform the public of the social background and principles of fair trade . ”
informing consumers is a top priority for the organizers , too . " we don ’ t have the financial means to do widespread television advertising , for example , ” said gepa ’ s schimmelpfennig .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " faire woche " or fair trade week aims to inform more consumers about the benefits of this sector .
“ there are still not enough consumers who know about fair products , " she said .
" that is why a campaign like the fair trade week is so important for us . ”
wieczorek-zeul agreed .
“ a lot of people in germany would like to buy fair products if they knew more about them and they were offered more widely , ” she said .
for almost 30 years , products from fair trade have been available in over 800 shops in germany .
the spectrum ranges from foods , such as coffee , tea , bananas and honey , to soccer balls , handicrafts and musical instruments .
a small , but significant sector large supermarket chains have also started offering fair-trade products .
stores belonging to the rewe group were the first to do so nearly a decade ago .
press spokeswoman astrid ohletz said the merchandise plays a significant role for rewe , one of the leading groups in the european grocery trade .
“ we want to give our customers the opportunity to support these projects , despite the products ’ higher prices , ” ohletz said .
“ of course , they are not fast-moving items .
but removing them from our range for this reason is not at all under consideration . ”
figures from the consumer organization verbraucher initiative show that the market share of products from fair trade does not exceed one percent in any segment of the respective market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee producers especially benefit from fair trade .
even the top seller fair coffee only reaches a market share of 0.7 percent in germany .
still , gepa has seen strong growth in supermarket sales .
in the financial year ending march 31 , 2004 , gepa product turnover via supermarkets was up 16 percent to € 6 million -lrb- $ 7.3 million -rrb- .
“ this is a hard-fought sector , ” said schimmelpfennig .
“ so this increase is a real accomplishment . ”
an imbalanced world economy “ fair trade points out how imbalanced and in need of reform the global economic relations still are , ” said wieczorek-zeul .
“ developing countries need a fair chance to evolve out of their own potential - and in order to do this , they need wide access to our markets . ”
according to schimmelpfennig , this political endorsement is indicative of fair trade ’ s development .
“ years ago , we didn ’ t have this support , ” she said .
“ now , what began as something ethical has gained an economic and political level . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , center , enjoys a " fair " breakfast in berlin .
fair trade week doesn ’ t just appeal to our conscience , though , but also to our taste buds , said wieczorek-zeul .

the film 's director oliver hirschbiegel talked to dw-world about his reasons behind the portrayal . cinemas across germany will begin showing the controversial world war ii film “ der untergang , ” german for “ the downfall , ” starting friday .
the film has created quite a stir due to its emotional depiction of adolf hitler 's private side during the last days of the war . the film shows a very intimate perspective of hitler that has caused some controversy and raised many questions .
is it okay to portray the human side of people like adolf hitler , a man reviled as a monster for his beliefs and actions ? the director of the film , oliver hirschbiegel , believes that the depiction of hitler as a lonely man deserted by his once loyal cronies days before taking his own life will help cinema goers understand a different period of history which needs to be confronted as much as the more publicized horrors if germany is truly to move out of the shadow of the third reich . director looks at history behind history " my wish is that if we are to deal with this history , there must not be anything stored away in the cupboards , " hirschbiegel told dw-world .
" if we are to look seriously at these ' monsters ' then we must go into depth and let their backgrounds shine through .
there are 53,000 books about adolf hitler and none of these books look at the real man .
the fact is we can only raise new questions about him , not offer answers . " those who gathered to catch the first early afternoon showing of the film in bonn expressed the hope that the film would help them understand what happened in germany sixty years ago , what made the third reich possible and how hitler the man compared to the image of hitler the dictator . " i 'm here because i want to find out what it was like , ” said one movie-goer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz in der untergang .
the film has been attracting media coverage for weeks ahead of its release and has generated fierce debates over the legitimacy of portraying hitler ’ s human side .
many argue that this constitutes a watering down of the beast he was .
hirschbiegel explains that showing the human side of the nazi leader enhances the horrors of what germany stood for at the time .
the film helps to dispel the belief that the nazis were monsters by showing that human beings are capable of plotting and executing such atrocities . human side forgotten " these horrific murders became possible , because these people - the jews and all others , the poles , the russians - were not seen as people .
they were seen as unworthy of life , lower than beasts .
adolf hitler was a mass murderer who made fully conscious decisions which led to this horror , " the director said . hirshbiegel says it is dangerous to put hitler in a different category and pretend that an ordinary person could never commit such horrible crimes . many of those who have seen the film have seen no problem with the director 's approach to the personal portrayal of hitler .
many understand that despite committing inhuman atrocities , hitler was indeed a person , not a diabolic creature .
" i think it 's right to show he had a human side , " one person said , " although one shouldn ’ t stress it too much . " film can not convey full horror , says director other complaints have been leveled at the film 's choice of focus .
hitler 's final days are shown in berlin with little reference to what his nefarious plans had achieved in the wider world .
the nazi leader struggles with his final days , sitting in his bunker far removed from reality , desperately clinging to his illusions of the final victory as he plans strategic movements of an army that has already crumbled . throughout the entire film there is no mention of the holocaust . " i say it is impossible to show the misery , the desperation of the camps , " hirschbiegel says .
" it is cinematically impossible to illustrate this horror .
it is an unfeasible project , i believe , and other colleagues have similar experiences . " despite the criticism , audiences in germany and across europe are expected to flock to see the film in an attempt to get a glimpse of the man behind the monstrous myth . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : villainous typecasting ?

the high costs of developing flat screen television and falling demand will eat into potential profits .
low profitability in televisions , dvd recorders and audio equipment will be offset by profits from mobile products .
operating profit in the electronics business fell 46 % to 49.5bn yen -lrb- $ 449m ; £ 250m -rrb- in the 2003 holiday period .
sluggish " we are not in a position where we will see profits in home electronics rise all that much compared with the previous year , " said sony president kunitake ando .

ysgol hermon closed last term despite a protracted legal battle by parents to keep the 53-pupil school open .
two others nearby shut at the same time .
the parents have launched the national small school fund to help current and future schools threatened with closure .
members of the group are asking for support from 800 rural schools .
chris tomos , chair of the hermon campaign , said the fund would " offer support to welsh schools who are being threatened by their local education authority " .
he said that , during their fight to keep the school open , there were " several lost opportunities " during the consultation period with the education authority .
he said that the group could have been " much more vigorous and strengthened their case " if they had known how the consultation would proceed .
jane davidson backed the council 's decision " had there been external support from a national fund , then additional courses of action could have halted the closure notice , " he said .
the group has said it will be sending the letter to thousands of schools , associations and individuals across wales .
in july , the parents lost their appeal to save hermon school in cardiff 's high court .
they had mounted a strong campaign since pembrokeshire council made the decision to shut hermon community primary school last september .
however , they have said they are determined to fight on and hoped to find a way to run the school independently .
the fight over the school has been a long-running affair , with many twists and turns .

ysgol hermon closed last term despite a protracted legal battle by parents to keep the 53-pupil school open .
two others nearby shut at the same time .
the parents have launched the national small school fund to help current and future schools threatened with closure .
members of the group are asking for support from 800 rural schools .
chris tomos , chair of the hermon campaign , said the fund would " offer support to welsh schools who are being threatened by their local education authority " .
he said that , during their fight to keep the school open , there were " several lost opportunities " during the consultation period with the education authority .
he said that the group could have been " much more vigorous and strengthened their case " if they had known how the consultation would proceed .
jane davidson backed the council 's decision " had there been external support from a national fund , then additional courses of action could have halted the closure notice , " he said .
the group has said it will be sending the letter to thousands of schools , associations and individuals across wales .
in july , the parents lost their appeal to save hermon school in cardiff 's high court .
they had mounted a strong campaign since pembrokeshire council made the decision to shut hermon community primary school last september .
however , they have said they are determined to fight on and hoped to find a way to run the school independently .
the fight over the school has been a long-running affair , with many twists and turns .
in april , campaigners won permission to mount their legal challenge , and they secured legal aid to cover the costs .
then in june , the welsh assembly government lost an appeal to prevent the judicial review , arguing that the parents ' challenge should have been brought earlier .

earlier this year , the company dropped controversial plans for a 20 % rise in prices which was sparked by a row with its gas supplier .
phoenix announced its annual price review on friday .
the company estimates the 11.3 % increase averages out at 81p per week , or £ 42 per year , for the typical household .
its chief executive , peter dixon , said the price rise was unavoidable . "
it is our considered view that this is the best deal possible " eleanor gill general consumer council " following consultation with both the regulator and the general consumer council , the new gas price is the lowest possible price , " he said .
the company said the increase was smaller than could have been expected , as it had renegotiated its supply agreement with wholesaler centrica and reduced the charge paid by consumers for the use of local pipelines .
eleanor gill of the general consumer council said the increase could have been much worse .
" following a detailed examination of phoenix 's price review in conjunction with the northern ireland authority for energy regulation , it is our considered view that this is the best deal possible , " she said .
' context ' dermott maccann , of gas and electricity regulator ofreg , said : " this price increase must be seen in the context of a significant rise in wholesale gas commodity prices as well as phoenix moving to reflect the cost rises resulting from a new contract with its wholesale gas supplier . "
dup economy spokesman george dawson said he was encouraged by new working relationships between phoenix , the general consumer council and ofreg . "
we will keep our fingers crossed and hope that these very high worldwide energy prices we have seen in recent times decrease and then the next time we talk about gas price changes , it will be downwards rather than upwards " richard rodgers phoenix " this means that price rises in the future will be subject to full scrutiny and that the long term benefits of the consumer and the company will be protected , " he said .
however , sdlp assembly member alasdair mcdonnell said the increase was " too large to be reasonable " .
" its timing is terrible as we face the prospect of water charges and / or rates increases .
neither business nor consumers can afford such sudden swings , " he said .
phoenix business director richard rodgers said any price rise was unwelcome but must be seen in the context of worldwide energy prices " which have gone to record highs " .
" we have seen the price of brent crude oil rise to $ 40 and the price of gas in the world markets brought as close to the price of oil , " he told bbc radio ulster on friday .
he added : " we will keep our fingers crossed and hope that these very high worldwide energy prices we have seen in recent times decrease and then the next time we talk about gas price changes , it will be downwards rather than upwards . "

bruce crawford has lodged a motion at holyrood over bt 's plans to close a sixth of scotland 's 6,000 call boxes .
bt said its plans to close some of the loss making ones were driven by the huge rise in mobile phone ownership .
but mr crawford argues that phone boxes provide a lifeline to the emergency services and wants the parliament to recognise their public value .
the member for scotland and fife says they help people who can not or do not want to buy mobile phones to communicate .
rolling review the motion urges bt to consult more directly with the communities that will be affected and to reconsider its plans .
closure of the payphones in scotland is the last phase of a rolling review that will eventually see about 10,000 payphones disappear across britain in less than two years .
bt said there had been " a complete culture change in communication " .
the mobile phone has impacted on phone box demand the company last month completed its review of existing pay phones across england , wales , and scotland .
kiosks will be axed in glasgow , edinburgh , dundee , aberdeen and in most other parts of the country .
the company said it would consult with local authorities and community councils over which phones across scotland will be removed and that it also intended to retain 850 loss-making boxes across the country .
" bt is proud of its payphone network and we intend to protect it for the future , but the payphones division has to stand on its own feet , " paul hendron , director of bt payphones , recently told bbc news online .
people living in rural areas argue many kiosks earmarked for disposal are potential life-savers , especially in areas where mobile signals are unobtainable or where elderly residents may not have mobiles .
bt said it was looking to the future with innovations such as converting 1,200 payphones to multimedia kiosks featuring internet , e-mail , and text messaging .
it is also in the middle of a programme to install wi-fi access points in broadband-enabled payphones .

the newspaper said its journalist had been working for three weeks in the catering department at westminster .
sun managing editor graham dudman thinks the stunt exposed " very serious " failings in security at the commons .
eight protesters who tried to barge into the commons chamber at westminster have now been released on police bail .
commons leader peter hain is reportedly " absolutely furious " about the latest breach of westminster security .
mr dudman said reporter anthony france was able to get a job as a waiter using false references - which were not checked in any way but " could n't have been more bogus " .
the materials he smuggled in in the midst of heightened security on thursday included batteries , wire , a timer and modelling clay .
security ' amateurish ' mr dudman said it " could n't have been anything other " than a bomb , the only difference being it was 20g of modelling clay instead of semtex .
photographs of the reporter also show him serving tea to deputy prime minister john prescott while at westminster .
mr dudman told the bbc 's today programme : " it just simply beggars belief that on the day that ... everybody was saying : ' i can assure you we are going to ratchet up security , it 's never going to be tighter ' , that same day a man from the sun walks in carrying what could have been a bomb .
" it 's simply unbelievable . "
" the sun has done the house a favour by exposing the amateurish and old-fashioned culture which threatened the very cockpit of our democracy " commons leader peter hain the reporter 's picture had already been on the paper 's front page after he smuggled a fake bomb onto a plane at birmingham international airport .
mr hain said the stunt had confirmed all his worst fears about security in the commons , exposing " the amateurish and old-fashioned culture which threatened the very cockpit of our democracy " .
" it 's not just government ministers at risk but the 14,000 other people who work in the palace of westminster who are at risk in this modern age of suicide bombers , " he said .
" i have immediately asked the security services to close the loophole exposed by the sun . "
mr hain has called for the appointment of a central director of security to oversee the protection of parliament , to take over responsibility from the serjeant-at-arms and his staff . "
this completes britain 's worst week of security blunders " mark oaten liberal democrat home affairs spokesman shadow leader of the house oliver heald described the latest breach as a " scandal " and said security checks needed to be tightened .
the liberal democrats also said commons security needed an overhaul , with a greater role for scotland yard .
" this completes britain 's worst week of security blunders , " said lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten .
and metropolitan police chief sir john stevens has urged a review of the rule banning police from entering the commons chamber without being invited by the serjeant-at-arms .
but former speaker lord weatherall defended the serjeant-at-arms .
" i think it is utterly wrong to blame him for lapses of this kind , " he told today .
" if one has , as i understand , an insider helping people get around security , it is a very serious matter and something 's got to be done . "
" stunts of this kind can always be perpetrated , one never hears of people who fail to get in because they have been found out . "
bbc chief political correspondent mark mardell said it seemed the reporter managed to smuggle in the equipment " when security was at its highest " .
he said the claim was embarrassing for the house of commons security services .
he said : " the government feels we need one central figure who 's in charge of all of this . "
he said the fact the reporter 's bag was not searched was not unusual as a member of staff - but proper checks should have been made before he was given the job .
police have released on bail eight protesters who were arrested on suspicion of forgery , burglary with intent to commit criminal damage and violent disorder after bursting into the commons .
all eight must return to a central london police station in october .

sun managing editor graham dudman thinks the stunt exposed " very serious " failings in security at the commons .
eight protesters who tried to barge into the commons chamber at westminster have now been released on police bail .
commons leader peter hain is reportedly " absolutely furious " about the latest breach of westminster security .
mr dudman said reporter anthony france was able to get a job as a waiter using false references - which were not checked in any way but " could n't have been more bogus " .
the materials he smuggled in in the midst of heightened security on thursday included batteries , wire , a timer and modelling clay .
security ' amateurish ' mr dudman said it " could n't have been anything other " than a bomb , the only difference being it was 20g of modelling clay instead of semtex .
photographs of the reporter also show him serving tea to deputy prime minister john prescott while at westminster .
mr dudman told the bbc 's today programme : " it just simply beggars belief that on the day that ... everybody was saying : ' i can assure you we are going to ratchet up security , it 's never going to be tighter ' , that same day a man from the sun walks in carrying what could have been a bomb .
" it 's simply unbelievable . "
the sun has done the house a favour by exposing the amateurish and old-fashioned culture which threatened the very cockpit of our democracy commons leader peter hain hain slams ' antiquated ' security the reporter 's picture had already been on the paper 's front page after he smuggled a fake bomb onto a plane at birmingham international airport .
mr hain said the stunt had confirmed all his worst fears about security in the commons , exposing " the amateurish and old-fashioned culture which threatened the very cockpit of our democracy " .
" it 's not just government ministers at risk but the 14,000 other people who work in the palace of westminster who are at risk in this modern age of suicide bombers , " he said .
" i have immediately asked the security services to close the loophole exposed by the sun . "
mr hain has called for the appointment of a central director of security to oversee the protection of parliament , to take over responsibility from the serjeant-at-arms and his staff .
this completes britain 's worst week of security blunders mark oaten liberal democrat home affairs spokesman shadow leader of the house oliver heald described the latest breach as a " scandal " and said security checks needed to be tightened .
the liberal democrats also said commons security needed an overhaul , with a greater role for scotland yard .
" this completes britain 's worst week of security blunders , " said lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten .
and metropolitan police chief sir john stevens has urged a review of the rule banning police from entering the commons chamber without being invited by the serjeant-at-arms .
but former speaker lord weatherall defended the serjeant-at-arms .
" i think it is utterly wrong to blame him for lapses of this kind , " he told today .
" if one has , as i understand , an insider helping people get around security , it is a very serious matter and something 's got to be done . "
security was stepped up following wednesday 's commons invasion " stunts of this kind can always be perpetrated , one never hears of people who fail to get in because they have been found out . "
bbc chief political correspondent mark mardell said it seemed the reporter managed to smuggle in the equipment " when security was at its highest " .
he said the claim was embarrassing for the house of commons security services .
he said : " the government feels we need one central figure who 's in charge of all of this . "
he said the fact the reporter 's bag was not searched was not unusual as a member of staff - but proper checks should have been made before he was given the job .
police have released on bail eight protesters who were arrested on suspicion of forgery , burglary with intent to commit criminal damage and violent disorder after bursting into the commons .
all eight must return to a central london police station in october .
