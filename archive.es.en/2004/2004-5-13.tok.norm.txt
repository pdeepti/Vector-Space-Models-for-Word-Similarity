the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .

germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .

schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.05.2004 eurovision goes english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's tanel padar won with " everbody " in 2001 english has become the pop music world 's chosen language - a fact that has n't gone unnoticed by a majority of contestants in europe 's campy eurovision song contest , which takes place on saturday . what do sertab erener from turkey , marie n from latvia and tanel padar from estonia have in common ?
they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

though the federal statistics office on thursday released a preliminary report showing the german economy had grown modestly by 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004 , the lost tax revenue this year alone will amount to close to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 11.8 billion -rrb- . " the results … clarify the consequences three years of stagnation has had on all german budgets , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters after the panel released its results thursday afternoon . no tax hikes , no spending cuts the embattled finance minister , who has been called on to resign by opposition politicians , said the government would not hike taxes or cut more spending as some economists had speculated .
eichel , who has built his reputation on reining in spending , said doing so now would be " poison " for the nascent economic upswing in germany . government officials are also no doubt wary of voter backlash .
germans are already bristling at unpopular welfare and labor market reforms pushed through by the government in recent months .
voters in a number of upcoming state elections are not likely to react well to the prospect of unfilled potholes , less police or fewer school books over the next few years . " largest financial disaster " in history opposition party officials had statements ready when the bad news hit .
christian democratic union secretary general laurenz meyer called on eichel to freeze the budget and then resign , along with the rest of the government .
representatives of cdu 's sister party in the opposition , the christian social union , expressed a similar sentiment . " the … coalition government is driving germany into the largest financial disaster in its history , " said michael glos , head of the csu parliamentary group . commentary from the european union will likely be just as biting .
thursday 's results all but confirmed that germany would break eu budgetary rules for a fourth year running in 2005 .
the stability & growth pact promises fines for any government with a deficit of more than 3 percent .
some economists predict a deficit as high as 4 percent for germany . fiscal discipline eichel has yet to come up with a comprehensive plan to fill the € 40.2 billion in tax hole the federal government will have to deal with in the next three years .
for the current year , eichel said he planned to maintain fiscal discipline but allowed the possibility that he would increase the spending deficit . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german finance minister faces " week of truth " finance minister hans eichel is under intense pressure ahead of the release of tax estimates that will likely reveal a massive budget shortfall and lead to another violation of the eu stability pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .

but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .

it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .

it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .

and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

though the federal statistics office on thursday released a preliminary report showing the german economy had grown modestly by 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004 , the lost tax revenue this year alone will amount to close to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 11.8 billion -rrb- . " the results … clarify the consequences three years of stagnation has had on all german budgets , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters after the panel released its results thursday afternoon . no tax hikes , no spending cuts the embattled finance minister , who has been called on to resign by opposition politicians , said the government would not hike taxes or cut more spending as some economists had speculated .
eichel , who has built his reputation on reining in spending , said doing so now would be " poison " for the nascent economic upswing in germany . government officials are also no doubt wary of voter backlash .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .

germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .

schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital .

speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us .

though the federal statistics office on thursday released a preliminary report showing the german economy had grown modestly by 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004 , the lost tax revenue this year alone will amount to close to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 11.8 billion -rrb- . " the results … clarify the consequences three years of stagnation has had on all german budgets , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters after the panel released its results thursday afternoon . no tax hikes , no spending cuts the embattled finance minister , who has been called on to resign by opposition politicians , said the government would not hike taxes or cut more spending as some economists had speculated .
eichel , who has built his reputation on reining in spending , said doing so now would be " poison " for the nascent economic upswing in germany . government officials are also no doubt wary of voter backlash .
germans are already bristling at unpopular welfare and labor market reforms pushed through by the government in recent months .
voters in a number of upcoming state elections are not likely to react well to the prospect of unfilled potholes , less police or fewer school books over the next few years . " largest financial disaster " in history opposition party officials had statements ready when the bad news hit .
christian democratic union secretary general laurenz meyer called on eichel to freeze the budget and then resign , along with the rest of the government .
representatives of cdu 's sister party in the opposition , the christian social union , expressed a similar sentiment . " the … coalition government is driving germany into the largest financial disaster in its history , " said michael glos , head of the csu parliamentary group . commentary from the european union will likely be just as biting .
thursday 's results all but confirmed that germany would break eu budgetary rules for a fourth year running in 2005 .
the stability & growth pact promises fines for any government with a deficit of more than 3 percent .
some economists predict a deficit as high as 4 percent for germany . fiscal discipline eichel has yet to come up with a comprehensive plan to fill the € 40.2 billion in tax hole the federal government will have to deal with in the next three years .
for the current year , eichel said he planned to maintain fiscal discipline but allowed the possibility that he would increase the spending deficit . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german finance minister faces " week of truth " finance minister hans eichel is under intense pressure ahead of the release of tax estimates that will likely reveal a massive budget shortfall and lead to another violation of the eu stability pact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.05.2004 eurovision goes english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's tanel padar won with " everbody " in 2001 english has become the pop music world 's chosen language - a fact that has n't gone unnoticed by a majority of contestants in europe 's campy eurovision song contest , which takes place on saturday . what do sertab erener from turkey , marie n from latvia and tanel padar from estonia have in common ?
they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .

while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .

now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 france , germany plan tighter industrial ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac still have some difficult talks ahead of them in a regular summit meeting in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder discussed industrial ties , the euro stability pact and condemned this week 's grisly in iraq . though harmony ruled the day at the 82nd franco-german summit in paris on thursday , there was also discord in the air .
the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .
" it speaks for the strength of american justice how they have moved to get to the bottom of this .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.05.2004 eurovision goes english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's tanel padar won with " everbody " in 2001 english has become the pop music world 's chosen language - a fact that has n't gone unnoticed by a majority of contestants in europe 's campy eurovision song contest , which takes place on saturday . what do sertab erener from turkey , marie n from latvia and tanel padar from estonia have in common ?
they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

though the federal statistics office on thursday released a preliminary report showing the german economy had grown modestly by 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004 , the lost tax revenue this year alone will amount to close to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 11.8 billion -rrb- . " the results … clarify the consequences three years of stagnation has had on all german budgets , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters after the panel released its results thursday afternoon . no tax hikes , no spending cuts the embattled finance minister , who has been called on to resign by opposition politicians , said the government would not hike taxes or cut more spending as some economists had speculated .
eichel , who has built his reputation on reining in spending , said doing so now would be " poison " for the nascent economic upswing in germany . government officials are also no doubt wary of voter backlash .
germans are already bristling at unpopular welfare and labor market reforms pushed through by the government in recent months .
voters in a number of upcoming state elections are not likely to react well to the prospect of unfilled potholes , less police or fewer school books over the next few years . " largest financial disaster " in history opposition party officials had statements ready when the bad news hit .
christian democratic union secretary general laurenz meyer called on eichel to freeze the budget and then resign , along with the rest of the government .
representatives of cdu 's sister party in the opposition , the christian social union , expressed a similar sentiment . " the … coalition government is driving germany into the largest financial disaster in its history , " said michael glos , head of the csu parliamentary group . commentary from the european union will likely be just as biting .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

though the federal statistics office on thursday released a preliminary report showing the german economy had grown modestly by 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004 , the lost tax revenue this year alone will amount to close to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 11.8 billion -rrb- . " the results … clarify the consequences three years of stagnation has had on all german budgets , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters after the panel released its results thursday afternoon . no tax hikes , no spending cuts the embattled finance minister , who has been called on to resign by opposition politicians , said the government would not hike taxes or cut more spending as some economists had speculated .
eichel , who has built his reputation on reining in spending , said doing so now would be " poison " for the nascent economic upswing in germany . government officials are also no doubt wary of voter backlash .
germans are already bristling at unpopular welfare and labor market reforms pushed through by the government in recent months .
voters in a number of upcoming state elections are not likely to react well to the prospect of unfilled potholes , less police or fewer school books over the next few years . " largest financial disaster " in history opposition party officials had statements ready when the bad news hit .
christian democratic union secretary general laurenz meyer called on eichel to freeze the budget and then resign , along with the rest of the government .
representatives of cdu 's sister party in the opposition , the christian social union , expressed a similar sentiment . " the … coalition government is driving germany into the largest financial disaster in its history , " said michael glos , head of the csu parliamentary group . commentary from the european union will likely be just as biting .
thursday 's results all but confirmed that germany would break eu budgetary rules for a fourth year running in 2005 .
the stability & growth pact promises fines for any government with a deficit of more than 3 percent .
some economists predict a deficit as high as 4 percent for germany . fiscal discipline eichel has yet to come up with a comprehensive plan to fill the € 40.2 billion in tax hole the federal government will have to deal with in the next three years .
for the current year , eichel said he planned to maintain fiscal discipline but allowed the possibility that he would increase the spending deficit . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german finance minister faces " week of truth " finance minister hans eichel is under intense pressure ahead of the release of tax estimates that will likely reveal a massive budget shortfall and lead to another violation of the eu stability pact .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment .

they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.05.2004 eurovision goes english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's tanel padar won with " everbody " in 2001 english has become the pop music world 's chosen language - a fact that has n't gone unnoticed by a majority of contestants in europe 's campy eurovision song contest , which takes place on saturday . what do sertab erener from turkey , marie n from latvia and tanel padar from estonia have in common ?
they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 france , germany plan tighter industrial ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac still have some difficult talks ahead of them in a regular summit meeting in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder discussed industrial ties , the euro stability pact and condemned this week 's grisly in iraq . though harmony ruled the day at the 82nd franco-german summit in paris on thursday , there was also discord in the air .
the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .
" it speaks for the strength of american justice how they have moved to get to the bottom of this .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .

they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .

it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .

while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .

" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 france , germany plan tighter industrial ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac still have some difficult talks ahead of them in a regular summit meeting in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder discussed industrial ties , the euro stability pact and condemned this week 's grisly in iraq . though harmony ruled the day at the 82nd franco-german summit in paris on thursday , there was also discord in the air .
the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .
" it speaks for the strength of american justice how they have moved to get to the bottom of this .

german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .

germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .

schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .

germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .

schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .

though the federal statistics office on thursday released a preliminary report showing the german economy had grown modestly by 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2004 , the lost tax revenue this year alone will amount to close to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 11.8 billion -rrb- . " the results … clarify the consequences three years of stagnation has had on all german budgets , " german finance minister hans eichel told reporters after the panel released its results thursday afternoon . no tax hikes , no spending cuts the embattled finance minister , who has been called on to resign by opposition politicians , said the government would not hike taxes or cut more spending as some economists had speculated .
eichel , who has built his reputation on reining in spending , said doing so now would be " poison " for the nascent economic upswing in germany . government officials are also no doubt wary of voter backlash .
germans are already bristling at unpopular welfare and labor market reforms pushed through by the government in recent months .
voters in a number of upcoming state elections are not likely to react well to the prospect of unfilled potholes , less police or fewer school books over the next few years . " largest financial disaster " in history opposition party officials had statements ready when the bad news hit .
christian democratic union secretary general laurenz meyer called on eichel to freeze the budget and then resign , along with the rest of the government .
representatives of cdu 's sister party in the opposition , the christian social union , expressed a similar sentiment . " the … coalition government is driving germany into the largest financial disaster in its history , " said michael glos , head of the csu parliamentary group . commentary from the european union will likely be just as biting .
thursday 's results all but confirmed that germany would break eu budgetary rules for a fourth year running in 2005 .
the stability & growth pact promises fines for any government with a deficit of more than 3 percent .
some economists predict a deficit as high as 4 percent for germany . fiscal discipline eichel has yet to come up with a comprehensive plan to fill the € 40.2 billion in tax hole the federal government will have to deal with in the next three years .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .

the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.05.2004 eurovision goes english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's tanel padar won with " everbody " in 2001 english has become the pop music world 's chosen language - a fact that has n't gone unnoticed by a majority of contestants in europe 's campy eurovision song contest , which takes place on saturday . what do sertab erener from turkey , marie n from latvia and tanel padar from estonia have in common ?
they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc athens will not jeopardize olympics for stability pact greek finance minister giorgos alogoskoufis insisted there is no way his government will cut back on costs relating to the upcoming olympics , despite massive overspending that threatens to bring athens into conflict with eu budget rules .
" there is no way that we will jeopardize the olympics for this reason , " said alogoskoufis told the euobserver in brussels .
" we are looking at other areas of public expenditure ... not the olympics . "
the costs of preparing the 2004 olympic games , which begin in less than 100 days time , have spiraled out of control and blown a large hole in greece 's budget deficit .
athens originally budgeted 4.6 billion euros for the games , but due to delays in completing the work and higher than expected construction costs , some now estimate the final bill as high as 10 billion euros .
and this weighs heavily on the greek budget deficit , potentially bringing athens into conflict with the european commission .
after elections in march , the new greek government announced it was raising its 2003 deficit projection from 1.2 percent of gdp to 2.95 percent , and putting it perilously close to the three percent ceiling imposed by the euro zone 's stability and growth pact rules .
last week , eurostat , brussels ' statistical office , declared that greece had indeed broken through the limit in 2003 with a deficit of 3.2 percent .
alogoskoufis blames part of the overspending on increased security costs for the games .
" there were many reasons for the overruns .
one was the delays .
second is the increased cost of security ... it 's a lot of money , but because of the international situation we have to be extra careful " .
the olympics is expected to be supervised by 70,000 security officials , outnumbering athletes by almost seven-to-one .
costs on security could be as high as one billion euro .
despite prioritizing the " greatest show on earth , " the charismatic 49-year-old minister emphasized his country 's strong commitment to the euro rules .
" it 's difficult , " he said .
" it 's not easy to maintain it below the three percent , but we are committed to the stability pact . "
and he hinted that his fellow ministers were sympathetic to athens ' plight .
" i made it clear to them both in the euro zone group and in the ecofin -lsb- meeting of eu finance ministers -rsb- ... that this is a temporary and one-off event . "

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc athens will not jeopardize olympics for stability pact greek finance minister giorgos alogoskoufis insisted there is no way his government will cut back on costs relating to the upcoming olympics , despite massive overspending that threatens to bring athens into conflict with eu budget rules .
" there is no way that we will jeopardize the olympics for this reason , " said alogoskoufis told the euobserver in brussels .
" we are looking at other areas of public expenditure ... not the olympics . "
the costs of preparing the 2004 olympic games , which begin in less than 100 days time , have spiraled out of control and blown a large hole in greece 's budget deficit .
athens originally budgeted 4.6 billion euros for the games , but due to delays in completing the work and higher than expected construction costs , some now estimate the final bill as high as 10 billion euros .
and this weighs heavily on the greek budget deficit , potentially bringing athens into conflict with the european commission .
after elections in march , the new greek government announced it was raising its 2003 deficit projection from 1.2 percent of gdp to 2.95 percent , and putting it perilously close to the three percent ceiling imposed by the euro zone 's stability and growth pact rules .
last week , eurostat , brussels ' statistical office , declared that greece had indeed broken through the limit in 2003 with a deficit of 3.2 percent .
alogoskoufis blames part of the overspending on increased security costs for the games .
" there were many reasons for the overruns .
one was the delays .
second is the increased cost of security ... it 's a lot of money , but because of the international situation we have to be extra careful " .
the olympics is expected to be supervised by 70,000 security officials , outnumbering athletes by almost seven-to-one .
costs on security could be as high as one billion euro .
despite prioritizing the " greatest show on earth , " the charismatic 49-year-old minister emphasized his country 's strong commitment to the euro rules .
" it 's difficult , " he said .
" it 's not easy to maintain it below the three percent , but we are committed to the stability pact . "
and he hinted that his fellow ministers were sympathetic to athens ' plight .
" i made it clear to them both in the euro zone group and in the ecofin -lsb- meeting of eu finance ministers -rsb- ... that this is a temporary and one-off event . "

in a letter to u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the group said numerous foreign reporters who did n't have long-term visas were taken into custody or sent home over the past year .
" many of them were treated like criminals , " the organization wrote .
the group said that journalists researching in the united states were merely doing their job , not seeking employment and the practices should be stopped .
" the discrimination against journalists , and along with it press freedom , damages the usa 's international reputation , " djv head michael konken said . more briefs 12.05.2004 -pipe- german president slams country 's elites 12.05.2004 -pipe- minister demands central islamic database 12.05.2004 -pipe- father who dressed kids as suicide bombers loses appeal 11.05.2004 -pipe- more germans hospitalized after alcohol abuse 11.05.2004 -pipe- hamburg confiscates , sells welfare recipients ' cars 11.05.2004 -pipe- germany wants cia chief as witness in sept .

it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .

but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in .

back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc solana to push for eu foreign minister job the parisian paper le monde quoted sources saying that javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign policy , will push for his post to be " boosted " at a meeting of eu heads of state and government on june 17 and 18 .
in other words , he would like the foreseen european foreign minister position to be brought forward and come into force before the whole constitution is put into place - something not likely to happen before 2006 .
the post would combine solana 's current role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by the uk 's chris patten .
the eu foreign minister would be responsible for handling the eu 's external relations and would also serve as vice-president of the european commission .
the new post would also eventually have an " external action service " or a diplomatic service to provide back-up .
if solana is named to the office , it would mean the end of compatriot joaquin almunia 's eu career after recently replacing pedro solbes as commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , as the big member states are slated to give up their second office in the next commission .
however , the spaniard may not be the only one interested in the job .
a wave of speculation in german media last year said that german foreign minister joschka fischer was also keen on position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc athens will not jeopardize olympics for stability pact greek finance minister giorgos alogoskoufis insisted there is no way his government will cut back on costs relating to the upcoming olympics , despite massive overspending that threatens to bring athens into conflict with eu budget rules .
" there is no way that we will jeopardize the olympics for this reason , " said alogoskoufis told the euobserver in brussels .
" we are looking at other areas of public expenditure ... not the olympics . "
the costs of preparing the 2004 olympic games , which begin in less than 100 days time , have spiraled out of control and blown a large hole in greece 's budget deficit .
athens originally budgeted 4.6 billion euros for the games , but due to delays in completing the work and higher than expected construction costs , some now estimate the final bill as high as 10 billion euros .
and this weighs heavily on the greek budget deficit , potentially bringing athens into conflict with the european commission .
after elections in march , the new greek government announced it was raising its 2003 deficit projection from 1.2 percent of gdp to 2.95 percent , and putting it perilously close to the three percent ceiling imposed by the euro zone 's stability and growth pact rules .
last week , eurostat , brussels ' statistical office , declared that greece had indeed broken through the limit in 2003 with a deficit of 3.2 percent .
alogoskoufis blames part of the overspending on increased security costs for the games .
" there were many reasons for the overruns .
one was the delays .
second is the increased cost of security ... it 's a lot of money , but because of the international situation we have to be extra careful " .
the olympics is expected to be supervised by 70,000 security officials , outnumbering athletes by almost seven-to-one .
costs on security could be as high as one billion euro .
despite prioritizing the " greatest show on earth , " the charismatic 49-year-old minister emphasized his country 's strong commitment to the euro rules .
" it 's difficult , " he said .
" it 's not easy to maintain it below the three percent , but we are committed to the stability pact . "
and he hinted that his fellow ministers were sympathetic to athens ' plight .
" i made it clear to them both in the euro zone group and in the ecofin -lsb- meeting of eu finance ministers -rsb- ... that this is a temporary and one-off event . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc athens will not jeopardize olympics for stability pact greek finance minister giorgos alogoskoufis insisted there is no way his government will cut back on costs relating to the upcoming olympics , despite massive overspending that threatens to bring athens into conflict with eu budget rules .
" there is no way that we will jeopardize the olympics for this reason , " said alogoskoufis told the euobserver in brussels .
" we are looking at other areas of public expenditure ... not the olympics . "
the costs of preparing the 2004 olympic games , which begin in less than 100 days time , have spiraled out of control and blown a large hole in greece 's budget deficit .
athens originally budgeted 4.6 billion euros for the games , but due to delays in completing the work and higher than expected construction costs , some now estimate the final bill as high as 10 billion euros .
and this weighs heavily on the greek budget deficit , potentially bringing athens into conflict with the european commission .
after elections in march , the new greek government announced it was raising its 2003 deficit projection from 1.2 percent of gdp to 2.95 percent , and putting it perilously close to the three percent ceiling imposed by the euro zone 's stability and growth pact rules .
last week , eurostat , brussels ' statistical office , declared that greece had indeed broken through the limit in 2003 with a deficit of 3.2 percent .
alogoskoufis blames part of the overspending on increased security costs for the games .
" there were many reasons for the overruns .
one was the delays .
second is the increased cost of security ... it 's a lot of money , but because of the international situation we have to be extra careful " .
the olympics is expected to be supervised by 70,000 security officials , outnumbering athletes by almost seven-to-one .
costs on security could be as high as one billion euro .
despite prioritizing the " greatest show on earth , " the charismatic 49-year-old minister emphasized his country 's strong commitment to the euro rules .
" it 's difficult , " he said .
" it 's not easy to maintain it below the three percent , but we are committed to the stability pact . "
and he hinted that his fellow ministers were sympathetic to athens ' plight .
" i made it clear to them both in the euro zone group and in the ecofin -lsb- meeting of eu finance ministers -rsb- ... that this is a temporary and one-off event . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.05.2004 eurovision goes english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's tanel padar won with " everbody " in 2001 english has become the pop music world 's chosen language - a fact that has n't gone unnoticed by a majority of contestants in europe 's campy eurovision song contest , which takes place on saturday . what do sertab erener from turkey , marie n from latvia and tanel padar from estonia have in common ?
they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2004 france , germany plan tighter industrial ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac still have some difficult talks ahead of them in a regular summit meeting in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder discussed industrial ties , the euro stability pact and condemned this week 's grisly in iraq . though harmony ruled the day at the 82nd franco-german summit in paris on thursday , there was also discord in the air .
the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .
" it speaks for the strength of american justice how they have moved to get to the bottom of this .

defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture .

fischer 's visit came in the wake of a widening scandal over the alleged abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad .
the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital .

" we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us .

the affair has sparked international outrage . speaking to reporters after talks with rice , fischer said he had expressed the shock and anger felt by germans and all europeans over the prisoner abuse scandal . fischer repeated demands that the scandal had to be " cleared at all costs " and said he had made clear to the americans that those responsible had to brought to justice and that the conditions in iraqi prisons had to be changed . high-ranking members of the ruling social democratic party in germany went further , calling for the resignation of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
franz müntefering , the general secretary of chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd , said that had the same thing happened in germany , there would be immediate change . power should be handed back to iraqis in an interview with german television broadcaster zdf fischer said he believed that an investigation into the events in iraqi prisons was already underway .
the minister however stressed certain decisions " were for the americans to take . "
he added that the incidents in iraq showed at the same time that " sovereignty had to be handed over to an interim iraqi administration as soon as possible and that there should be elections in a few months . " fischer and rice also discussed the situation in the middle east and a new u.s. initiative for a peace plan . talks on the issue will continue at the end of the week during the g-8 foreign ministers ' conference in washington as well as on monday in berlin , when rice meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed kureia in the german capital . " moral leadership " of the u.s. needed earlier fischer also met u.s. secretary of state colin powell .
speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . in a subsequent interview with berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper , fischer said washington could strengthen its moral position by joining the international criminal court .
the united states is one of several countries who do n't officially recognized the court , based in the hague , netherlands . german officials are hoping that the various investigations and inquiries underway by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which fischer said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses on the part of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell : " deplorable situation " powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .

speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .

schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .

the german distaste over paris ' handling of the acquisition of the french-german pharmaceutical giant aventis by a french firm could still be felt .
german government officials harshly criticized paris for meddling in the takeover talks to the benefit of france 's synthélabo .
during his speech before the cabinets of the french and german governments , the first such meeting in over a year , president jacques chirac acknowledged those differences and said he understood germany 's reservations .
" there was a lot of criticism , " he said .
" for my part , i regret that very much .
when there 's criticism , it always contains a kernal of truth .
it does n't just come out of nowhere . "
chirac also sought to assuage his german colleagues by noting that the company 's german employees and research labs would be preserved in the deal .
" i think things have been cleared up now .
the agreement reached between aventis and synthélabo also contains a -lrb- clause -rrb- guaranteeing jobs and research centers in germany .
i understand that 's a real problem for germany .
the federal chancellor insistently pointed that out to me .
i think that has now been arranged . "
tensions over alstom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick kron , chairman of the troubled french engineering giant alstom but the bickering over aventis may soon be forgotten as officials turn their focus to the beleaguered french industrial giant alstom , a symbol of french engineering pride , whose units could be prize catches for german industrial groups .
germany 's siemens is currently seeking to take over alstom 's turbine-manufacturing unit .
speaking ambiguously about the talks , chirac said that german-french relations also extend to industrial policies .
observers took the statements to mean that paris is sending a signal to berlin that it may seek to find an amicable agreement over the alstom problem rather than the divisive approach it took in the aventis deal .
before the end of the month , chirac and his economics minister , nicolas sarkozy , plan to meet with their counterparts in berlin to discuss industrial policy in more detail .
debt-strapped alstom , including its railway and turbine businesses , is expected to be a major issue at the meeting .
sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of any sales that would break up the company .
stability pact 2.0 ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during thursday 's meeting , german chancellor gerhard schröder also discussed the euro stability pact , which ensures the strength of the eu 's common currency .
for several years now , both countries have violated a major provision in the pact that requires euro zone members to maintain a 3 percent cap on deficit spending .
and there 's no end in sight for the surplus red ink .
schröder also confirmed reports that germany would likely loosen its fiscal austerity measures .
" in the current situation , we need to create the possibility to apply the stability pact , actually , the stability and growth pact - i always point that out - in a way that is growth oriented , " schröder said .
earlier this week , schröder publicly stated for the first time that germany would like to see changes in the stability pact to make it more flexible in difficult economic times .
recently , germany also admitted it would likely violate the pact in 2005 for the fourth year in a row .
disgust over iraq killing the two leaders also expressed outrage on thursday over the beheading of an american civilian worker in iraq , describing it as a heinous crime .
" there can be no excuse for this .
it is one of the most horrific murders we have seen in recent times , " schröder said .
schröder and chirac also condemned the torture of iraqi prisoners by united states forces .
they said such methods belonged to the past .
at the same time , the two leaders said praised the united states for acting to bring those responsible to justice .
schröder said it was clear that both the public and the political establishment in the u.s. were horrified by the torture of prisoners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.05.2004 german professor under fire for defending torture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolffsohn sparked outrage with his remarks condoning torture controversial comments by a military historian who said torture can be a legitimate instrument in the war on terror have triggered an outcry in germany .
defense minister struck is considering disciplinary action . german defense minister peter struck said on wednesday that statements condoning torture made by professor michael wolffsohn , a military historian , were " unbelievable " and " unacceptable " and said he was considering taking legal and disciplinary steps against the professor . wolffsohn - an instructor in munich at one of germany 's top two military officer training schools - attracted controversy earlier this month when he told a german television reporter that " if we attempt to counter terror with gentlemanly methods , we will fail . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hooded and wired iraqi prisoner is seen at the abu ghraib prison near baghdad .
referring to the excesses at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , he said , " in the anti-terror fight there are really no effective laws of war .
i believe that torture , or the threat of torture , is legitimate as one of the instruments against terror , because terror basically … has nothing to do with our civilized order . " however , wolffsohn said that the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib " has gone too far . "
he later said his remarks were a " scientific-theoretical reflection " and that he did condemn torture . " a german soldier tortures no one " on wednesday , struck was at pains to make clear that the country 's military establishment did not share wolffsohn 's controversial views . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " a german soldier tortures no one , " struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said during a television talk show on the prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
" i am firmly convinced that even a young and not particularly educated soldier would never do what we have seen , " he added . germany 's stringent postwar military training rules force soldiers to take responsibility for their actions , reflecting lessons drawn from the nazi era .
struck said he was confident that german soldiers , who are deployed in peacekeeping missions in the balkans and afghanistan , would never mistreat prisoners . " i can rule that out because our soldiers - even the ones who only do nine months ' compulsory service - learn during their training that they must not follow illegal orders . "
the minister added , " it would be an illegal order if anyone were to demand that prisoners be treated in the way that we have , for example , seen in the pictures from iraq . " struck said he had ordered a meeting with wolffsohn to determine whether the professor was instructing his students in a manner consistent with the german constitution . wolffsohn known to court controversy wolffsohn , who describes himself as a german-jewish patriot , is no stranger to controversy .
in his writings , he has often encouraged more national pride to normalize german-israeli relations and said that the holocaust should not be instrumentalized to serve the interests of specific groups . critics have blamed his views for playing into the hands of right-wing radicals . his recent comments condoning torture are n't exactly new .
similar statements have been made by a host of security experts - both german and non-german - at security conferences across germany in the past . last year , the governor of the state of hesse , roland koch , defended a police officer who had used the threat of force to extract the location of a kidnapped child from his suspected kidnapper .
the kidnapper under threat of coercion did confess to the crime and led police to the boy , who was already dead by then . during a debate over the kidnapping incident , jörg schonbohm , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , called for people to think about the methods they would want the law to use " if vast numbers of people were under threat from terrorism . " " no endorsement of torture in a democracy " but wolffsohn 's comments seem to have struck a nerve this time given the fact that he was speaking on a nationally-televised talk show shortly after the release of photographs showing iraqi detainees being abused by american soldiers . angelika beer , head of germany 's green party said that wolffsohn had lost the right to continue in his teaching job and that he should voluntarily step down .
beer said the right to freedom of expression stopped " at the point when it departs from the fundamental principles of our democracy and constitution . " even the head of the munich military school , professor hans georg lößl has distanced himself from the professor 's remarks .
though lößl said that wolffsohn 's comments should be treated as his personal view , he admitted that the affair had affected their working relationship . " torture and torture threats are instruments of dictators and despots .
they can in no way be endorsed in a democratic society , " lößl said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer condemns killing as " cold-blooded , barbaric act " german minister fischer decried the killing of an american hostage in iraq on wednesday as he wrapped up his u.s. visit after talks with national security adviser condoleezza rice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.05.2004 eurovision goes english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's tanel padar won with " everbody " in 2001 english has become the pop music world 's chosen language - a fact that has n't gone unnoticed by a majority of contestants in europe 's campy eurovision song contest , which takes place on saturday . what do sertab erener from turkey , marie n from latvia and tanel padar from estonia have in common ?
they each won a eurovision song contest over the past three years .
they also all sang themselves to victory in english . the last one to take home the grand prix d 'eurovision de la chanson , as the competition was previously known , with a song in their native language was israel 's dana international in 1998 with " diva . "
her successors all deserted their mother tongue . that tradition is likely to be continued this year : in istanbul , where the 2004 contest is taking place , only five out of 24 finalists will stick to their native language .
it 's not a surprising but rather a logical development , according to eurovision expert jan feddersen . " they all sing in english because they want to win , " feddersen , who writes for the berlin daily tageszeitung , told dw-world .
anyone looking for success has to cater to the audience - and the audience considers songs in english to be young and hip . however , the language of shakespeare has n't taken over everywhere on the continent .
while scandinavians do n't mind communicating in english , people in spain and portugal still are n't quite as comfortable using ingles .
and turkey will probably long have joined the european union by the time france decides to go anglais . english with a personal touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's setab erener the winner of the eurovision song contest 2003 , celebrates her victory .
but singing in english is even controversial in countries that have had anglophile entries in the past .
while turkey 's erener -lrb- photo -rrb- may have won with " everywhere that i can " last year , many of her countrymen did n't approve of dropping turkish lyrics . just like in turkey , people in other countries also worry that songs sung in english might speed along a loss of cultural identity .
it 's a fear not shared by feddersen .
while many of the eurovision songs are sounding more and more alike and lack local flavor , he believes that each country has still managed to preserve its identity . " of course there are still differences , despite the common language , " he said .
" i think it 's wrong to say that it all comes down to lyrics . " kiddie-techno from the balkans truly successful bands such as scandinavian groups roxette and the cardigans managed to preserve a taste of their roots , feddersen said . " turkish entries still sound different most of the time .
they are often more physical than scandinavian songs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max during a rehearsal in istanbul .
contestants from the balkans are another case in point , according to the expert .
" they 're kind of kiddie-techno-like , with a little dancefloor thrown in . " even max -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is representing germany in istanbul with a song called " ca n't wait until tonight , " is typically german , albeit in a very modern way , feddersen said . of shock-frozen finns and hysterical italians besides , a song contest dominated by english should be seen as a victory for international understanding rather than a loss of identity , the journalist said .
back in the multi-lingual days , a finnish singer would sometimes raise eyebrows in europe 's south .
" the italians would go : ' have they all been shock-frozen up there ? " ' in turn , the finns would see a bit of italian dolce vita as somewhat hysterical .
now , europeans are slowly coming to terms with the fact that there can be a bit of greece in germany and or a bit of spain in slovenia . " english is the mode of transportation , " feddersen said .
" it 's making sure that europe , and not the nation state , takes center stage at the contest .

bristol zoo gardens needs greenfingered animal fans to help grow the bamboo which its one-year-old panda cubs , tenzing and babu , feed on .
the bears and their parents need to eat 10 branches of bamboo each day , but the zoo 's horticultural department can not keep up with the demand .
now it is asking the city 's gardeners to satisfy the animals ' appetites by donating their bamboo harvests .
conservation programme caroline brown , senior keeper at the zoo , said : " we can not supply enough bamboo from the zoo gardens to keep up with the red pandas ' voracious appetites .
" if anyone can help by supplying us with fresh bamboo on a regular basis we would be very grateful . "
tenzing and babu were born at the zoo as part of a conservation breeding programme .
red pandas are endangered in the wild because much of their habitat and food supply has been destroyed by human activity .
the animals are also hunted by poachers in their native china .

back in 1974 , aged 21 , he borrowed £ 5,000 from his father to buy his then employers , wellington civil engineering , which was on the verge of going out of business .
that investment by the-then site engineer was the first step in a business career which peaked in the formation of housing giant redrow .
he quit redrow in 2000 - at the time he was going through a divorce from his first wife - and has cashed in shares worth £ 198m in the family homes company .
hotel chain now , as he returns to make a second bid for the merseyside club , the previous overture being rejected , he is showing a tenacity first evident in his business career .
" all i knew for certain was that i had a passion for the construction industry , and was determined to make redrow a success , " he recalled in a company history produced for staff members .
the offer is a counter bid to talks currently taking place with the prime minister of thailand steve morgan he still owns a £ 50m stake in the firm which he floated in 1994 , and is rated at 137th in the british rich list , with a reputed £ 312m fortune .
that fortune has been boosted by his hotel interests - during the 1990s he built up st david 's hotels , before cashing in five years ago .
he retains a £ 68m holding in de vere hotels , who , in 1999 , bought his two major hotels , -lrb- st david 's park hotel in north wales , and carden park hotel , near chester -rrb- , and is now a major shareholder in the hotel chain .
mr morgan lives in jersey but is spending £ 8m renovating carden hall , a stately home near his former hotel .
he plans soon to move back to the mainland with his second wife didi - they married in 2002 - and their new baby .
his finances were hit by a £ 100m pay-out to his former wife pamela , who he met as a 13-year-old schoolboy .
' new money ' mr morgan , born in garston , south liverpool , has a 5 % stake in liverpool , and made his first bid for the club in march , worth about £ 50m .
the new deal proposed by mr morgan , who says he is " no roman abramovich " , is worth £ 73m .
he said : " i wrote -lrb- on tuesday -rrb- to the club 's directors with details of my proposal which remains open for seven days .
mr morgan has been a supporter since the 1960s shankly era " that includes a rights issue open to all shareholders which will generate £ 61m of new money plus another share issue directed at supporters of the club which could generate a further £ 12m .
" the offer is a counter bid to talks currently taking place with the prime minister of thailand . "
both parts of the plan would be underwritten by mr morgan 's company , bridgemere investments .
mr morgan 's new offer would allow the current chairman and majority shareholder david moores to buy some of the new shares .
the businessman has been a long-term critic of the liverpool owner , whose family has run the club for half-a-century .
' love the club ' first-and-foremost mr morgan is a fan , who has followed the club since his schooldays when bill shankly was manager .
he has set out his counter bid to that of the thai pm , thaksin shiniwatra , along those lines .
the 51-year-old said : " i believe the future of liverpool football club is best served by the people who love the club the most - its supporters , of whom i am proud to be one . "
however , in an age of increasing commercialism in football , he is crucially aware of the importance of branding and off-field commercial clout .
" whether we like or not , premiership football is big business and needs to be approached with a very businesslike and commercial attitude , " he said in book the boot room boys .
" football clubs are big businesses today .
they have to be commercial and manchester united have led the way in the this .
" but at the same time it 's all about playing football and those lads going out on the park and winning the matches - that 's what it 's all about and let 's not lose sight of that . "
' opportunities missed ' and , perhaps ominously for those at the anfield helm , he also said : " running businesses is like running a football club and being mr nice guy is seldom the right attribute to head and lead a successful organisation , whether it 's a football club , a hotel or a house building company . "
author of the boot room boys , an investigation of the management techniques used in liverpool 's heyday , is stephen f kelly .
he said : " his main criticism of liverpool in the past , apart from lack of on-pitch success , is that they have failed to seize the business opportunities that the likes of manchester united have capitalised on .
" his record show he has made a success of his businesses , and he would bring that same determination to succeed to liverpool football club . "

back in 1974 , aged 21 , he borrowed £ 5,000 from his father to buy his then employers , wellington civil engineering , which was on the verge of going out of business .
that investment by the-then site engineer was the first step in a business career which peaked in the formation of housing giant redrow .
he quit redrow in 2000 - at the time he was going through a divorce from his first wife - and has cashed in shares worth £ 198m in the family homes company .
hotel chain now , as he returns to make a second bid for the merseyside club , the previous overture being rejected , he is showing a tenacity first evident in his business career .
" all i knew for certain was that i had a passion for the construction industry , and was determined to make redrow a success , " he recalled in a company history produced for staff members .
the offer is a counter bid to talks currently taking place with the prime minister of thailand steve morgan he still owns a £ 50m stake in the firm which he floated in 1994 , and is rated at 137th in the british rich list , with a reputed £ 312m fortune .
that fortune has been boosted by his hotel interests - during the 1990s he built up st david 's hotels , before cashing in five years ago .
he retains a £ 68m holding in de vere hotels , who , in 1999 , bought his two major hotels , -lrb- st david 's park hotel in north wales , and carden park hotel , near chester -rrb- , and is now a major shareholder in the hotel chain .
mr morgan lives in jersey but is spending £ 8m renovating carden hall , a stately home near his former hotel .
he plans soon to move back to the mainland with his second wife didi - they married in 2002 - and their new baby .
his finances were hit by a £ 100m pay-out to his former wife pamela , who he met as a 13-year-old schoolboy .
' new money ' mr morgan , born in garston , south liverpool , has a 5 % stake in liverpool , and made his first bid for the club in march , worth about £ 50m .
the new deal proposed by mr morgan , who says he is " no roman abramovich " , is worth £ 73m .
he said : " i wrote -lrb- on tuesday -rrb- to the club 's directors with details of my proposal which remains open for seven days .
mr morgan has been a supporter since the 1960s shankly era " that includes a rights issue open to all shareholders which will generate £ 61m of new money plus another share issue directed at supporters of the club which could generate a further £ 12m .
" the offer is a counter bid to talks currently taking place with the prime minister of thailand . "
both parts of the plan would be underwritten by mr morgan 's company , bridgemere investments .
mr morgan 's new offer would allow the current chairman and majority shareholder david moores to buy some of the new shares .
the businessman has been a long-term critic of the liverpool owner , whose family has run the club for half-a-century .
' love the club ' first-and-foremost mr morgan is a fan , who has followed the club since his schooldays when bill shankly was manager .
he has set out his counter bid to that of the thai pm , thaksin shiniwatra , along those lines .
the 51-year-old said : " i believe the future of liverpool football club is best served by the people who love the club the most - its supporters , of whom i am proud to be one . "
however , in an age of increasing commercialism in football , he is crucially aware of the importance of branding and off-field commercial clout .
" whether we like or not , premiership football is big business and needs to be approached with a very businesslike and commercial attitude , " he said in book the boot room boys .
" football clubs are big businesses today .
they have to be commercial and manchester united have led the way in the this .
" but at the same time it 's all about playing football and those lads going out on the park and winning the matches - that 's what it 's all about and let 's not lose sight of that . "
' opportunities missed ' and , perhaps ominously for those at the anfield helm , he also said : " running businesses is like running a football club and being mr nice guy is seldom the right attribute to head and lead a successful organisation , whether it 's a football club , a hotel or a house building company . "
author of the boot room boys , an investigation of the management techniques used in liverpool 's heyday , is stephen f kelly .

the french capital already has a vibrant radio spectrum , offering everything from jewish radio to serbian and arabic stations , but until now nobody had thought about the needs of its 400,000 english-speaking expatriates .
the station is mainly aimed at ex-pats and tourists but what do the french themselves make of it ?
is this yet another example of the creeping anglo-saxon challenge to the french language , french music and french culture ?
on the champs elysee , parisians of all ages seemed surprisingly keen on the idea .
" it 's necessary in paris , because french people do n't speak very well english , " says one smartly-dressed french businesswoman .
she says she may well listen in to improve her own english .

" i am in favour of a strong europe , and more cultural exchanges between different countries so having an english-language station here is great news . "

" it could bring more english girls to france , " he says with a hopeful look .
" and that will make paris a more cosmopolitan place . "

so far it 's only available on cable , satellite and the internet , but soon paris live radio hopes to take its place on fm - alongside the city 's many other foreign language stations .
founded by an australian barrister , renzie duncan , it 's aimed mainly at expatriates , and the millions of tourists who visit each year .
fans of english-language music , though , may be disappointed .
by law , radio broadcasters in france have to play a minimum of 40 % of their music in french - a law passed to protect french pop from being swamped by anglo-saxon imports .
paris live says up to half its music will be in french - including show-casing young up and coming french bands .
the station 's staff are just as international as its potential audience - with presenters from britain , australia , france , japan , and ireland .
judging by parisians ' enthusiastic response to the idea , paris live could prove a surprise hit in this usually rather conservative city .

analysis by julian knight bbc news online personal finance reporter as delegates gather for the national association of pension funds -lrb- napf -rrb- conference , the protests of an estimated 60,000 workers who have lost their pension after their employer has gone bust seem to grow ever louder .
pensions have been a ' horror show ' from misselling scandals to the mass closure of lucrative employee final salary schemes , the past few years have been one long horror show for uk pensions .
yet , some are cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a much healthier position now than twelve months ago , " david astley , director of benefits at the napf , a body which promotes employer pension provision , told bbc news online .
" legislation is on the way and schemes look stronger following a year of share price growth . "
market rally last year , a running joke in the city was that the bulk of ftse100 firms had become pension schemes with a business tacked-on .
uk pensions in crisis latest news , background and analysis from bbc news online 's pensions in-depth section find out more about pensions but the stock market rally in the past twelve months has eased the financial position of many company pension schemes .
the pension fund deficit facing uk firms narrowed by £ 60bn during the second half of 2003 , according to the confederation of british industry .
as a result , uk firms will have to divert less cash to prop up their ailing pension schemes .
headline grabbers forthcoming legal changes should also help future pensioners .
the government 's pension bill , which aims to lighten the administrative and financial load on schemes while enhancing member protection , is close to becoming law .
many employers simply took the decision to shut their final salary scheme behind closed doors , without talking to unions or staff michele lewis , tuc the requirement on schemes to increase pensions by up to 5 % a year is scrapped and the tax treatment of pensions is to be simplified with the aim of slashing the administration costs of running a scheme .
but the headline grabbing measure contained in the bill is the proposed introduction of a pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- .
the ppf will act like an insurance guaranteeing that retired scheme members will receive 100 % of their pension , while members still of working age will get at least 90 % .
under current rules , members of working age often have little to show for years of contributions when a pension scheme is wound-up .
but workers who have already lost their pensions may also be offered help soon .
faced with the possibility of a major back bench rebellion , tony blair and pensions minister andrew smith hinted in april at compensation for these workers .
treasury misgivings over the size of any compensation bill seems to be the one major remaining stumbling block .
warning but the rise in pension funds ' earnings from their stock market investment and the anticipated legal changes do little to alleviate the main concern of many , namely the shift by many employers from final salary schemes to money purchase ones .
pension victims have turned up the volume one in four workplace final salary schemes have closed to new entrants in the past year and most of them have been replaced by money purchase schemes , according to the napf .
the change means that increasingly workers are having to face investment risks which under final salary schemes are shouldered by employers : under such schemes , employees are guaranteed a retirement income based on final salary and length of service , regardless of what happens in the financial markets .
while under money purchase schemes , the pension size is based on level of contributions and investment performance .
brendan barber , trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- general secretary , is expected to issue a stark warning that unions will strike to protect their final salary pension schemes when he addresses the napf conference on friday .
but such vocal protest might be arriving to late .
after all , " many employers simply took the decision to shut their final salary scheme behind closed doors , without talking to unions or staff " , noted tuc pensions policy officer michelle lewis .

analysis by julian knight bbc news online personal finance reporter as delegates gather for the national association of pension funds -lrb- napf -rrb- conference , the protests of an estimated 60,000 workers who have lost their pension after their employer has gone bust seem to grow ever louder .
pensions have been a ' horror show ' from misselling scandals to the mass closure of lucrative employee final salary schemes , the past few years have been one long horror show for uk pensions .
yet , some are cautiously optimistic .
" we are in a much healthier position now than twelve months ago , " david astley , director of benefits at the napf , a body which promotes employer pension provision , told bbc news online .
" legislation is on the way and schemes look stronger following a year of share price growth . "

uk pensions in crisis latest news , background and analysis from bbc news online 's pensions in-depth section find out more about pensions but the stock market rally in the past twelve months has eased the financial position of many company pension schemes .
the pension fund deficit facing uk firms narrowed by £ 60bn during the second half of 2003 , according to the confederation of british industry .
as a result , uk firms will have to divert less cash to prop up their ailing pension schemes .
headline grabbers forthcoming legal changes should also help future pensioners .
the government 's pension bill , which aims to lighten the administrative and financial load on schemes while enhancing member protection , is close to becoming law .
many employers simply took the decision to shut their final salary scheme behind closed doors , without talking to unions or staff michele lewis , tuc the requirement on schemes to increase pensions by up to 5 % a year is scrapped and the tax treatment of pensions is to be simplified with the aim of slashing the administration costs of running a scheme .
but the headline grabbing measure contained in the bill is the proposed introduction of a pension protection fund -lrb- ppf -rrb- .
the ppf will act like an insurance guaranteeing that retired scheme members will receive 100 % of their pension , while members still of working age will get at least 90 % .
under current rules , members of working age often have little to show for years of contributions when a pension scheme is wound-up .
but workers who have already lost their pensions may also be offered help soon .
faced with the possibility of a major back bench rebellion , tony blair and pensions minister andrew smith hinted in april at compensation for these workers .
treasury misgivings over the size of any compensation bill seems to be the one major remaining stumbling block .
warning but the rise in pension funds ' earnings from their stock market investment and the anticipated legal changes do little to alleviate the main concern of many , namely the shift by many employers from final salary schemes to money purchase ones .
pension victims have turned up the volume one in four workplace final salary schemes have closed to new entrants in the past year and most of them have been replaced by money purchase schemes , according to the napf .
the change means that increasingly workers are having to face investment risks which under final salary schemes are shouldered by employers : under such schemes , employees are guaranteed a retirement income based on final salary and length of service , regardless of what happens in the financial markets .
while under money purchase schemes , the pension size is based on level of contributions and investment performance .
brendan barber , trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- general secretary , is expected to issue a stark warning that unions will strike to protect their final salary pension schemes when he addresses the napf conference on friday .
but such vocal protest might be arriving to late .
after all , " many employers simply took the decision to shut their final salary scheme behind closed doors , without talking to unions or staff " , noted tuc pensions policy officer michelle lewis .

international regulations are expected to be endorsed at an organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- meeting in paris .
the new rules should make sure company managers will not be able to deceive their investors and accountants .
the oecd would also like to see shareholders becoming more involved .
wrong incentives the oecd is urging governments to tackle three major problems .
firstly , it believes that the shareholders should have more power to hold management to account .
they are the ultimate owners of the companies , but too often they have been passive when confronted with management manipulation that lifted the share price in the short term .
secondly , the oecd wants to abolish unfunded executive share options , which encouraged many managers to manipulate share prices for financial gain .
and it wants shareholders and boards to have more power to regulate executive salaries and require full disclosure of conflicts of interest , to create more checks and balances .
thirdly , it argues that checks and balances must be strengthened in the corporate sector , for example by forbidding accounting firms to also act as consultants -lrb- as happened in the case of enron and its accountants anderson , now defunct . -rrb- firms must also disclose relevant factors to the market .
the oecd says that in retrospect it is clear that the wrong incentives were given to managers - especially in the united states - during the corporate excesses of the l990s .
but it argues that governments , especially in the us and the uk , have now begun to tackle the issue .
code of conduct the oecd code of conduct has no formal legal status , but it is likely to form a basis for legal revisions in many of the 30 oecd countries .
enron-style scandals pose risks to the industrial economies the oecd first began work on corporate codes of conduct in the late 1990s , and it hopes to persuade both governments and companies to take its newly revised principles seriously .
it cites the uk approach as a model in this regard , with the cadbury code , introduced a few years ago , widely copied abroad .
the uk is now revising its own corporate governance legislation in line with oecd recommendations .
the oecd warned that no code or legal statute could prevent fraud or guarantee that there would be no scandals in the future .
but it was hopeful that in this , as in its fast-developing work on tax evasion and tax havens , it will have a broad influence on the development of corporate governance worldwide .

hollywood heart-throb brad pitt could be the best advert yet for dropping out of college - he gave up his journalism course at the university of missouri in the early 80s just before graduating , and headed for the bright lights of los angeles .
the eldest of three children , born in oklahoma in 1963 , pitt put his change of heart down to a simple " love of movies " .
career ladder and after only seven months of doing odd jobs around la including chauffeuring and delivering refrigerators , he landed an agent after taking acting classes .
as with many acting careers , pitt 's first jobs came in television , including soap operas dallas and another world , and the sitcom growing pains .
pitt and aniston have been together for six years his big screen debut came in 1989 slasher film cutting class but it was his role in ridley scott 's smash hit road movie thelma and louise that catapulted him into the spotlight in 1991 .
his small but raunchy part as geena davis 's lover immediately made him the latest hollywood sex symbol .
pitt failed to capitalise on his new-found status with his next few films , including the offbeat johnny suede , but he proved he was more than just a pretty face with the lead role in robert redford 's a river runs through it in 1992 .
a year later , he appeared with then girlfriend juliette lewis in murder spree film kalifornia , which was criticised by some for its violence and did not fare well at the box office .
a role opposite a-list star tom cruise in interview with a vampire followed and pitt also appeared in the tarantino-scripted true romance in 1993 .
settled down over the past 10 years , his film choices have proved to be a mixed bag but his a-list status and legion of female fans have excused him the odd poor movie among his more successful efforts .
his role as a gritty detective in thriller seven garnered praise in 1995 and his part as a mental patient in terry gilliam 's twelve monkeys the same year won him a golden globe for best supporting actor and an oscar nomination .
troy opens in the uk in may meet joe black with sir anthony hopkins and the big-budget seven years in tibet only received mixed reviews but pitt got back on track again with an unglamorous role in 1999 's fight club .
steven soderbergh 's 2002 remake of rat pack heist ocean 's 11 was also a big hit for pitt and fellow actors george clooney , matt damon and julia roberts .
pitt 's love life has taken up as many newspaper columns as his film career over the years - he dated lewis for several years and was engaged to gwyneth paltrow before meeting friends star jennifer aniston in 1998 .
the pair married in a private ceremony in malibu , california , in 2000 and are now arguably hollywood 's most famous couple .
pitt has yet to win an oscar and there are some critics who feel he has not entirely shaken off his pretty boy tag .
whether his efforts as a bronzed greek warrior in troy will dispel such misgivings is hard to say - although his female fans are unlikely to complain either way .
