the swedish and dutch leaders added their two cents to the session on friday . although the meeting of german cabinet members and top social democrat and green party leaders in bonn was overshadowed by events in russia where a two-and-a-half day hostage drama came to a bloody end friday , the participants still managed to discuss the vast reforms they have been pushing through in germany . chancellor gerhard schröder said the government would not waver on implementing the package of changes to germany 's labor market and social welfare system , which has provoked tens of thousands of people to take to the streets in protest over the past month . " the reforms must continue and they will continue , " schröder said saturday .
the chancellor ruled out any changes to the reform course . encouragement from abroad apparently sent in to bolster the troops , swedish prime minister göran persson and his dutch counterpart wim kok , both considered successful reformers of their countries ' social welfare systems , addressed the meeting on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson persson explained that swedes initially strongly opposed changes to the generous - and expensive - system .
" but at sometime people realized that what we were doing was right . "
after several years of reforms , sweden has more jobs , is more competitive and collects more tax revenue persson said . the swedish social democrat encouraged schröder 's government to stick to their reform course , which he predicted would indeed buoy germany 's economy and labor market . kok , who heads an eu working group charged with making the bloc into the most economically competitive part of the world by 2010 , also spoke to the participants about his country 's reforms . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "
danger of stereotyping but hartmut blank , a professor of social psychology at the university of leipzig , said the image of the easterner who looks to papa state for everything was widespread , but not necessarily accurate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .
" if the situation in the east remains negative over the long-term , doubts there could arise about democracy itself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform protests benefit german socialists voter support for the successor to the former communist party of east germany is reaching record highs as the party supports protests against the government 's welfare reforms .

" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said . speaking after eu foreign ministers discussed the darfur crisis at talks in the netherlands , he said the 25-member bloc will " continue to exert pressure on the sudanese government to comply with " un demands . a un deadline for khartoum to disarm its proxy militia in darfur , the janjaweed , accused of atrocities in the region , passed last week , with un secretary general kofi annan lamenting on wednesday that sudan has neither disarmed the arab militia nor stopped attacks against civilians in darfur . " it is necessary to make it quite clear that we may be forced to impose sanctions at some point in the future , " said bot , adding that eu officials have been asked to draw up a list of possible sanctions and their implications . he added that an oil boycott " may be one of the measures , " but stressed that the ministers had not discussed details of exactly what sanctions could be imposed . the united states is planning to introduce a new un security council resolution to deal with the darfur crisis , after a critical report on khartoum 's compliance with the council 's demands in an earlier resolution . the dutch minister added that he hoped progress could be made at african union-sponsored talks between rebels from sudan 's darfur region and government officials from khartoum , which resumed saturday in the nigerian capital abuja . " we call on the parties at the abuja tals ... to move forward and to come to a settlement , " said bot . according to un estimates , up to 50,000 people have died in darfur , about 1.4 million people have fled their homes with about 180,000 crossing the border into chad . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq and russia to dominate eu meeting the recent wave of terror in russia and the middle east as well as the deteriorating security situation in iraq and a smorgasbord of conflicts dominate the eu foreign ministers meeting friday in the netherlands .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .

protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .

he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .

" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .

" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said . speaking after eu foreign ministers discussed the darfur crisis at talks in the netherlands , he said the 25-member bloc will " continue to exert pressure on the sudanese government to comply with " un demands . a un deadline for khartoum to disarm its proxy militia in darfur , the janjaweed , accused of atrocities in the region , passed last week , with un secretary general kofi annan lamenting on wednesday that sudan has neither disarmed the arab militia nor stopped attacks against civilians in darfur . " it is necessary to make it quite clear that we may be forced to impose sanctions at some point in the future , " said bot , adding that eu officials have been asked to draw up a list of possible sanctions and their implications . he added that an oil boycott " may be one of the measures , " but stressed that the ministers had not discussed details of exactly what sanctions could be imposed . the united states is planning to introduce a new un security council resolution to deal with the darfur crisis , after a critical report on khartoum 's compliance with the council 's demands in an earlier resolution . the dutch minister added that he hoped progress could be made at african union-sponsored talks between rebels from sudan 's darfur region and government officials from khartoum , which resumed saturday in the nigerian capital abuja . " we call on the parties at the abuja tals ... to move forward and to come to a settlement , " said bot . according to un estimates , up to 50,000 people have died in darfur , about 1.4 million people have fled their homes with about 180,000 crossing the border into chad . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq and russia to dominate eu meeting the recent wave of terror in russia and the middle east as well as the deteriorating security situation in iraq and a smorgasbord of conflicts dominate the eu foreign ministers meeting friday in the netherlands .

the swedish and dutch leaders added their two cents to the session on friday . although the meeting of german cabinet members and top social democrat and green party leaders in bonn was overshadowed by events in russia where a two-and-a-half day hostage drama came to a bloody end friday , the participants still managed to discuss the vast reforms they have been pushing through in germany . chancellor gerhard schröder said the government would not waver on implementing the package of changes to germany 's labor market and social welfare system , which has provoked tens of thousands of people to take to the streets in protest over the past month . " the reforms must continue and they will continue , " schröder said saturday .
the chancellor ruled out any changes to the reform course . encouragement from abroad apparently sent in to bolster the troops , swedish prime minister göran persson and his dutch counterpart wim kok , both considered successful reformers of their countries ' social welfare systems , addressed the meeting on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson persson explained that swedes initially strongly opposed changes to the generous - and expensive - system .
" but at sometime people realized that what we were doing was right . "
after several years of reforms , sweden has more jobs , is more competitive and collects more tax revenue persson said . the swedish social democrat encouraged schröder 's government to stick to their reform course , which he predicted would indeed buoy germany 's economy and labor market . kok , who heads an eu working group charged with making the bloc into the most economically competitive part of the world by 2010 , also spoke to the participants about his country 's reforms . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 14 years of german unification opinion : a progress report on german unity dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules solbes blames reunification for german economic woes communism sunk by the hunk in trunks ? current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2004 eastern attitudes toward the state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against social welfare cuts have been strongest in the east recent protests against welfare reforms in germany have been largest in the east .
some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "
danger of stereotyping but hartmut blank , a professor of social psychology at the university of leipzig , said the image of the easterner who looks to papa state for everything was widespread , but not necessarily accurate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .
" if the situation in the east remains negative over the long-term , doubts there could arise about democracy itself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform protests benefit german socialists voter support for the successor to the former communist party of east germany is reaching record highs as the party supports protests against the government 's welfare reforms .

the swedish and dutch leaders added their two cents to the session on friday . although the meeting of german cabinet members and top social democrat and green party leaders in bonn was overshadowed by events in russia where a two-and-a-half day hostage drama came to a bloody end friday , the participants still managed to discuss the vast reforms they have been pushing through in germany . chancellor gerhard schröder said the government would not waver on implementing the package of changes to germany 's labor market and social welfare system , which has provoked tens of thousands of people to take to the streets in protest over the past month . " the reforms must continue and they will continue , " schröder said saturday .
the chancellor ruled out any changes to the reform course . encouragement from abroad apparently sent in to bolster the troops , swedish prime minister göran persson and his dutch counterpart wim kok , both considered successful reformers of their countries ' social welfare systems , addressed the meeting on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson persson explained that swedes initially strongly opposed changes to the generous - and expensive - system .
" but at sometime people realized that what we were doing was right . "
after several years of reforms , sweden has more jobs , is more competitive and collects more tax revenue persson said . the swedish social democrat encouraged schröder 's government to stick to their reform course , which he predicted would indeed buoy germany 's economy and labor market . kok , who heads an eu working group charged with making the bloc into the most economically competitive part of the world by 2010 , also spoke to the participants about his country 's reforms . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder fears protests could erode unity chancellor schröder said he feared growing opposition against his social reforms could damage unity between eastern and western germany as protest organizers gear up for another round of weekly monday demonstrations .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "
danger of stereotyping but hartmut blank , a professor of social psychology at the university of leipzig , said the image of the easterner who looks to papa state for everything was widespread , but not necessarily accurate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 14 years of german unification opinion : a progress report on german unity dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules solbes blames reunification for german economic woes communism sunk by the hunk in trunks ? current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2004 eastern attitudes toward the state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against social welfare cuts have been strongest in the east recent protests against welfare reforms in germany have been largest in the east .
some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "
danger of stereotyping but hartmut blank , a professor of social psychology at the university of leipzig , said the image of the easterner who looks to papa state for everything was widespread , but not necessarily accurate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .
" if the situation in the east remains negative over the long-term , doubts there could arise about democracy itself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform protests benefit german socialists voter support for the successor to the former communist party of east germany is reaching record highs as the party supports protests against the government 's welfare reforms .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "
danger of stereotyping but hartmut blank , a professor of social psychology at the university of leipzig , said the image of the easterner who looks to papa state for everything was widespread , but not necessarily accurate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .

the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "
danger of stereotyping but hartmut blank , a professor of social psychology at the university of leipzig , said the image of the easterner who looks to papa state for everything was widespread , but not necessarily accurate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .
" if the situation in the east remains negative over the long-term , doubts there could arise about democracy itself , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reform protests benefit german socialists voter support for the successor to the former communist party of east germany is reaching record highs as the party supports protests against the government 's welfare reforms .

" whereas we note some progress in the humanitarian field we are still particularly worried at the security situation caused by lack of progress in disarming and controlling the janjaweed " pro-government militias , he said . speaking after eu foreign ministers discussed the darfur crisis at talks in the netherlands , he said the 25-member bloc will " continue to exert pressure on the sudanese government to comply with " un demands . a un deadline for khartoum to disarm its proxy militia in darfur , the janjaweed , accused of atrocities in the region , passed last week , with un secretary general kofi annan lamenting on wednesday that sudan has neither disarmed the arab militia nor stopped attacks against civilians in darfur . " it is necessary to make it quite clear that we may be forced to impose sanctions at some point in the future , " said bot , adding that eu officials have been asked to draw up a list of possible sanctions and their implications . he added that an oil boycott " may be one of the measures , " but stressed that the ministers had not discussed details of exactly what sanctions could be imposed . the united states is planning to introduce a new un security council resolution to deal with the darfur crisis , after a critical report on khartoum 's compliance with the council 's demands in an earlier resolution . the dutch minister added that he hoped progress could be made at african union-sponsored talks between rebels from sudan 's darfur region and government officials from khartoum , which resumed saturday in the nigerian capital abuja . " we call on the parties at the abuja tals ... to move forward and to come to a settlement , " said bot . according to un estimates , up to 50,000 people have died in darfur , about 1.4 million people have fled their homes with about 180,000 crossing the border into chad . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq and russia to dominate eu meeting the recent wave of terror in russia and the middle east as well as the deteriorating security situation in iraq and a smorgasbord of conflicts dominate the eu foreign ministers meeting friday in the netherlands .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "
as germany begins the process of instituting the biggest reform to its welfare system in decades , some of those in the east used to lives supported by generous monthly payments from the government will likely be forced to reexamine old attitudes .
the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .

the reforms , due to take effect at the beginning of next year , will reduce long-term unemployment benefits to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families .
the east will be particularly affected , since the unemployment rate there stands at around 18 percent , more than twice the rate in the west .
socialized by socialism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration against reforms in brandenburg the wave of demonstrations that swept through germany in august protesting upcoming welfare reforms were biggest in the eastern part of the country , the former east germany .
protestors have claimed the reforms will drive many into poverty .
they blame the government for failing to create jobs in the east .
that has some people saying easterners expect too much from the government , waiting for action to be taken from leaders and authorities instead of seizing the initiative and shaping their futures themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim gauck , right , with former interior minister rudolf seiters amid east german secret police files " they expect too much from those above them , " joachim gauck , former head of the office investigation files of the former east german secret police , told the braunschweiger zeitung newspaper .
he said easterners had not worked out what it meant to be citizens instead of subjects .
according to gauck and other commentators , the years under socialism have made it difficult for people to accept not only the benefits that come from living in a free , democratic society , but its responsibilities as well .
in the gdr , the state took care of one 's needs , from the state-run day care for children to an education , job , apartment and even vacations provided by the government .
values such as self-reliance and self-initiative had little chance of developing under the gdr 's repressive system .
most people placed a great deal of importance on navigating the system successfully without being noticed or coming within the sights of the government and secret police .
easterners tend to fault the policies of the government for their joblessness , according to gerd pickel , a professor of comparative sociology at the viadrina european university in frankfurt / oder .
that has led to the very angry response to the government 's plans to reduce welfare payments for the unemployed .
according to uwe lummitsch , it is also one of the causes for the resignation and unwillingness to aggressively hunt for work that he sees everyday in his work at the wolfen north housing complex .
" people have to understand that they have to take action themselves now , " he told dw-world .
" what we find unfortunate is the widespread attitude that people have a right to work .
no , they have a right to apply for work and fight for it . "
danger of stereotyping but hartmut blank , a professor of social psychology at the university of leipzig , said the image of the easterner who looks to papa state for everything was widespread , but not necessarily accurate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld 's once-booming chemical factory " one ca n't talk about the ' average ' easterner , " he told dw-world .
after reunification , many in the east watched as industries in their regions collapsed .
many were forced to move to the west to find work .
" some easterners showed more flexibility when it came to their jobs than westerners ever did . "
he warned against associating the high turnout rates for the protests in eastern cities with a feeling among easterners that the government should take care of everything .
he said the anger is primarily due to the dire economic situation there .
professor gerd pickel of viadrina agreed on that point , saying that western and eastern germany are still far apart in attitudes and beliefs largely because of the economic disparities between them .
according to his analysis , as long as those differences remain acute , there will be no internal or cultural unity , or common attitudes toward germany 's system of government .

some analysts say that due to eastern germans ' history under socialism , they tend to look to the state to solve their problems . uwe lummitsch , who works in the administration of a sprawling apartment complex in the former east germany , is often frustrated that his efforts to convince residents there to take the initiative in looking for work often come to nothing .
" the attitude is often , ' you , the state , have to do something for me , ' not that ' i want to do something for myself , " ' he told dw-world .
he said 40 years of socialism in the german democratic republic conditioned many people to keep their heads down , adopt a passive attitude , and wait for the state to lay out the path their lives should take .
" just as before , the state is seen as being responsible for taking action , " he said .
" but that 's not the case anymore . "

members say they want to reopen the debate before their annual conference later this month .
ten-year targets were set after the macpherson report into the death of stephen lawrence in 1999 , to make the police service more representative .
but many forces are likely to fall short , said the nbpa .
the organisation said this was despite a series of initiatives to encourage black and asian people to apply .
the macpherson report recommended police forces should have ethnic minority officers in proportion to the community being served .
progression ministers must now " seriously consider " affirmative action , under which a set number of posts at all ranks of the police service would be reserved for ethnic minorities , said the nbpa .
the move would be likely to require legislation .
the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- said it had concerns about the proposal - but agreed " radical " measures were needed if ethnic minority candidates were to be fast-tracked into the service .
police federation chairman jan berry told bbc radio 4 's today programme targets were needed but " if you have a quota you are giving preferential treatment to one group " .
she added : " this causes resentment among a workforce that uses teamwork to get on . "
difficulty she called the targets set for some areas " unachievable " .
" there are seven forces who will have great difficulty meeting the targets .
to meet them by 2009 they will have to recruit 80 % black officers , " she said .
but supt ali dizaei , one of britain 's top ethnic minority officers , told the programme that if two applicants of the same standard - one black , one white - were interviewed for a job and were the same standard , the black applicant should get it .
" there is no evidence at all that this debate , if implemented , is going to cause resentment , " he said .
" in the us , a gallup poll showed that 80 % of people agreed with this kind of selection . "
in april this year the metropolitan black police association -lrb- mbpa -rrb- suggested using positive discrimination to make the force more representative of london 's racial mix .
knock-on effect the association put forward the idea to the morris inquiry which was investigating how internal complaints concerning ethnic minority officers were carried out .
at the time president of the national black police association , ray powell , said positive discrimination would be useful in areas where there are a high percentage of ethnic minorities .
but he said there were already problems with ' positive action policies ' in the police force .
" if we are to have any affirmative action , it should be on retention and progression , not recruitment .
that would produce a knock-on effect , by example .
" black and asian officers like to know they make the grade as a detective because they are a good detective .
they can recruit as many people as they like , but set them up to fail , " he said .

a colony of livingstone 's fruit bats , whose wingspan can reach 5ft -lrb- 1.5m -rrb- , has been kept at jersey zoo in the channel islands for the last 12 years .
a number of the bats have now started to fly through a purpose-built tunnel in their enclosure in search of food .
the zoo , hq of the durrell wildlife conservation trust , is one of only two global sites where the bats are kept .
noah 's ark livingstone 's fruit bat -lrb- pteropus livingstonii -rrb- , also known as the comoro black flying fox from its home in the comores islands near madagascar , is thought to be at risk of imminent extinction because of the loss of its forest habitat .
the trust is working with a local group , action comores , to save the species .
it now has 30 bats on jersey ; another colony is at bristol zoo gardens .
the colony helps to sustain its environment the trust says it is necessary to keep the animals in captivity in order to encourage breeding , learn more about their needs and behaviour , and save them from extinction .
until now they have never been known to fly successfully for any distance in captivity .
but some have begun flying the full length of a 130ft -lrb- 40m -rrb- tunnel , planted with vegetation to encourage them to fly to reach their feed .
they are also proving their ability to sustain their own environment .
dozens of wild tomato , fig , melon and cape gooseberry plants are now growing in the tunnel 's earth floor , having germinated from seeds which had passed through the bats .
two young bats have been born in the tunnel this year , suggesting the animals are happy with it .
treasure troves dominic wormell , deputy head of mammals at the zoo , said : " of the some 950 species of bat that live worldwide , livingstone 's fruit bat is one of the largest and faces the greatest risk of extinction .
" in the comores , precious little forest remains - the islands are also home to a poor and rapidly expanding human population .
if areas that the bats depend on for their survival are not protected , this amazing species will be extinct within 10 years . "
mark stanley price , executive director of the trust , said : " durrell wildlife 's success with the bats in the comores is building on the back of its islands & highlands programme .
the flying foxes attract visitors " this has identified concentrations of unique and rare species , which have evolved together and are found only within very small areas and nowhere else on earth .
" islands and highlands make up only 5 % of the globe 's surface but account for 45 % of its endemic animal and plant species ; and of the 724 known animal extinctions in the last 400 years , half were on islands . "
there are thought to be about 1,000 bats on the two comores islands where they survive in the wild .
the bats are mostly covered in very dark brown-black fur , have rounded ears and large orange-brown eyes .
adults have a body length of about 1ft -lrb- 30cm -rrb- .
on average they weigh 1.1 to1.8lbs -lrb- 500-800g -rrb- , although bats born in captivity tend to be heavier as they generally fly less and eat more .

a colony of livingstone 's fruit bats , whose wingspan can reach 5ft -lrb- 1.5m -rrb- , has been kept at jersey zoo in the channel islands for the last 12 years .
a number of the bats have now started to fly through a purpose-built tunnel in their enclosure in search of food .
the zoo , hq of the durrell wildlife conservation trust , is one of only two global sites where the bats are kept .
noah 's ark livingstone 's fruit bat -lrb- pteropus livingstonii -rrb- , also known as the comoro black flying fox from its home in the comores islands near madagascar , is thought to be at risk of imminent extinction because of the loss of its forest habitat .
the trust is working with a local group , action comores , to save the species .
it now has 30 bats on jersey ; another colony is at bristol zoo gardens .
the trust says it is necessary to keep the animals in captivity in order to encourage breeding , learn more about their needs and behaviour , and save them from extinction .
until now they have never been known to fly successfully for any distance in captivity .
but some have begun flying the full length of a 130ft -lrb- 40m -rrb- tunnel , planted with vegetation to encourage them to fly to reach their feed .
they are also proving their ability to sustain their own environment .
dozens of wild tomato , fig , melon and cape gooseberry plants are now growing in the tunnel 's earth floor , having germinated from seeds which had passed through the bats .
two young bats have been born in the tunnel this year , suggesting the animals are happy with it .
treasure troves dominic wormell , deputy head of mammals at the zoo , said : " of the some 950 species of bat that live worldwide , livingstone 's fruit bat is one of the largest and faces the greatest risk of extinction .

in 2000 , he fooled al gore into underestimating his talent as a politician , causing mr gore to overreach .
this time , he has forced john kerry to have the wrong conversation with the voters .
when he should have been telling the voters his plan for the future , mr kerry has been spending his time talking about the past , believing that vietnam was the way to establish his credibility .
consequently , when the republicans raised doubts about mr kerry 's service in vietnam last month , he had nothing to fall back on .
money talk this gave george bush an opening at the republican convention .
he was able to show the breadth and width of his experience in office .
and in the absence of any detailed picture from mr kerry himself , mr bush filled in the blanks on mr kerry 's political record sheet .
he criticised mr kerry for a policy of " expanding government " , saying that mr kerry wanted more than two trillion dollars in new federal spending .
john kerry has left himself vulnerable to republican attacks george bush neatly glossed over the fact that he himself has expanded federal spending by 29 % since coming to office and sent the budget plummeting into the red .
the " tax and spend " attack on mr kerry works partly because that is what many americans assume democrats do , despite the fact that former president bill clinton successfully balanced his budget .
but it also works because mr kerry created the opening for the republicans to attack .
morals on show the republican convention was a virtuoso display of disciplined message .
every image and every speaker was carefully choreographed to reinforce in the voters ' minds the idea of george bush as a steadfast , principled , say-what-you-mean-and-mean-what-you-say kind of leader .
not a moment of doubt or hesitation .
no mention of the missing weapons of mass destruction .
or the ongoing bloodshed in iraq , a year after major hostilities were supposed to have ended .
iraq was portrayed as part and parcel of the war of terrorism , and a war of moral necessity , not choice .
bush has taken the lead in opinion polls the republican faithful held up banners that read : " a safer world " .
did this mean that mr bush had created a safer world ?
or was going to create a safer world ?
it was not clear .
and it did not matter .
what people saw on tv was the phrase and george bush .
a key difference between john kerry and george bush is that mr kerry is trying to find a coherent philosophy that fits the world .
president bush has his philosophy and is happy to let the world fit in around it .
losing momentum walking among the party faithful after his speech , the main reason people gave for liking mr bush is because they think of him as principled and resolute .
by contrast , they think mr kerry is a vacillating flip-flopper .
it is a powerful message , which certainly resonates with the party faithful .
the unknown question is whether it works for the undecided voters , who may well decide this election .
in these troubling times , will americans prefer someone as absolutist and unwavering as george bush ?
or will they go for someone with a more nuanced approach ?
excellent arguments can be made for both sides .
but the first major poll since the republican convention shows mr bush 11 points ahead of mr kerry - a huge bounce .
john kerry is going to have to work very hard if he is going to push back the republican momentum of the last month .
