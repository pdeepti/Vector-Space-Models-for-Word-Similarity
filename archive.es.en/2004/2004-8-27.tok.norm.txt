speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

authorities issued an arrest warrant against the 65-year-old for " acting as an accessory to attempted treason " , as well as " aiding the attempted development of atomic weapons " , the office said in a statement .
the judge released the man , identified as gerhard w. , on bail on thursday .

" we have already voluntarily implemented the industry-wide reforms that separate research and investment banking , " said deutsche bank spokeswoman rohini pragasam in a statement to reuters . inappropriate working practices from mid-1999 through mid-2001 , deutsche bank " engaged in acts and practices that created or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts , thereby imposing conflicts of interest on research analysts that the firms failed to manage in an adequate or appropriate manner , " the sec regulators said in the statement . the statement went on to explain that deutsche bank " issued research reports that were not based on principles of fair dealing and good faith , and did not provide a sound basis for evaluating facts , contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims about the covered companies , and / or contained opinions for which there were no reasonable bases . " in addition , there were supervisory deficiencies at the bank , according to the regulators .
half of the fines and restitution being paid will go into a fund for their customers ; the other half will go to state securities regulators . bank agrees to walk straight and narrow deutsche bank neither admitted to nor denied the allegations .
it did , however , agree to refrain from future violations and to restrict distributions of hot new stocks to favored company executives and directors , a practice known as " spinning . " the delay of more than a year for the settlement with deutsche bank was caused by its failing to promptly turn over internal e-mails during the investigation , the regulators said , and the firm is paying $ 7.5 million for that alleged lapse as part of the settlement . the $ 87.5 million being paid by deutsche bank also includes a $ 25 million civil fine for alleged conflicts of interest , restitution of $ 25 million , $ 25 million to fund independent securities research and $ 5 million for investor education . wall street giants hit by revelations the probe which led to the investigation into deutsche bank securities , which also included a number of high profile wall street firms , was prompted in part by abuses revealed by new york attorney general eliot spitzer and resulted in a massive $ 1.4 billion settlement that involved investment banking giants , including goldman sachs and merrill lynch . u.s. bank thomas weisel partners also voluntarily agreed to pay damages for many of the same reasons as deutsche bank securities on friday .

offering € 30,000 in rent for an eight-month stay , she accepted and seagal and crew moved in for the winter . fast forward to 2004 and edeltraud is still , to use the title of one of seagal 's own films , " out for justice " and still paying the price for the martial arts star 's stay at her home .
the landlady has once again appeared before a court in berlin this week to demand damages of € 170,000 from seagal for what has been called the wanton destruction of the property . doors , floors and walls trashed it is alleged that seagal and his crew went on a riot throughout the villa and " disassembled " doors , wooden flooring and wallpaper .
it is also claimed that the " under siege " star and friends ignored the lavatory and urinated every where but . the first attempt to get seagal to cough up for the renovation failed .
the presiding judge ruled that a rent of € 30,000 should be sufficient to cover any wear and tear to the property in an eight week period .
it was also pointed out that while the property was of a higher standard than , say , a motel , it was far from a museum when the action star and his entourage arrived .
therefore , seagal could not be expected to pay the entire amount for renovation on his own . court favors some payment from seagal if proved edeltraud 's second hearing went a little better .
this time the rejection did not come but the court did demand concrete proof that seagal and his posse were indeed those responsible for the mayhem and ensuing damage .
with this proof , the court said , seagal would stand to pay a considerable amount even if it is not the whole € 170,000 demanded .
the judge has suggested a payment similar to the € 30,000 paid for the eight-month rental period back in 2001 . seagal 's lawyers have rejected this out of hand , with the possible outcome being that edeltraud will have to add to her increasing legal bills to get the case into court for a third time .
on top of that , she faces a lawsuit herself .
seagal is suing her for defamation of character , claiming the allegations have damaged his reputation as a person , an actor and a businessman . expensive counter-claim aimed at landlady seagal 's claim is already in the u.s. legal system and should be heard in the next few weeks .
the actor 's lawyers somberly announced recently that the amount of damages their client could expect if the case goes his way , could be more than edeltraud 's villa is actually worth . edeltraud is considering her own counter counter claim .
the whole sorry business , she says , has in fact had damaging consequences on her own reputation and business .
the villa was due to house superstar tom cruise while he films " mission : impossible 3 " in berlin but now , possibly due to the continuing furor over the seagal case , cruise has pulled out .
the thought of staying in a house with alleged seagal pee all over the walls clearly does n't appeal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

" the war against terrorism is more than a set of specific laws , " nicholas howen , secretary general of the international commission of jurists -lrb- icj -rrb- , told a conference in berlin .
" it is a way of thinking . "
he added that this " disturbing rhetoric " assumed that rights and freedoms were a nuisance and interfered with security .
" we witness governments trying to justify torture in the name of national security , detainees held in legal black holes , the right to a fair trial cut down , " howen told more than 150 legal experts at the conference .
arthur chaskalson , the president of the icj , a geneva-based non-governmental organization , said human rights had never been under such threat since the end of the cold war .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said . " so this exploratory aspect is indeed an important one of the visit , but the road map is the game in town and is the basis of our policy . " a freeze on settlements germany has repeatedly urged israel to freeze its settlement activities while calling on the palestinian authority to initiate security reforms in clear steps that underline their commitment to the road map .
but after the vote in the general assembly in july israel accused eu countries of being biased and threatened freeze europe out of the peace process . on thursday , israel ’ s foreign minister silvan shalom appealed to europe not to support yet another united nations resolution sponsored by the palestinians which called for sanctions against israel over its west bank barrier .
spokesman plötner said the german government has yet to make up its mind . " germany believes – as the european union as a whole does – that israel has the right to defend its citizens against terror and violence .
this having been said we believe that the placing of the barrier beyond the green line inside palestinian territory bears the risk of establishing facts on the ground which will make a peace settlement along the lines of the road map more difficult , " he said . " as for the upcoming vote we have to look at it very carefully to see what exact proposal will be tabled . " palestinians have hinted they will ask the united nations security council in september to consider sanctions or some form of economic punishment against israel citing anti-apartheid boycotts against south africa as a precedent .
but foreign minister fischer , mindful of his role as a peace broker in the region – is unlikely to support such a drastic move . uwe hessler -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel criticizes europe for un resolution the palestinians won a victory against israel at the un in new york on tuesday when the body voted against the so-called " west bank barrier .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said . " so this exploratory aspect is indeed an important one of the visit , but the road map is the game in town and is the basis of our policy .

" the war against terrorism is more than a set of specific laws , " nicholas howen , secretary general of the international commission of jurists -lrb- icj -rrb- , told a conference in berlin .
" it is a way of thinking . "
he added that this " disturbing rhetoric " assumed that rights and freedoms were a nuisance and interfered with security .
" we witness governments trying to justify torture in the name of national security , detainees held in legal black holes , the right to a fair trial cut down , " howen told more than 150 legal experts at the conference .
arthur chaskalson , the president of the icj , a geneva-based non-governmental organization , said human rights had never been under such threat since the end of the cold war .

speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

authorities issued an arrest warrant against the 65-year-old for " acting as an accessory to attempted treason " , as well as " aiding the attempted development of atomic weapons " , the office said in a statement .
the judge released the man , identified as gerhard w. , on bail on thursday .
w. , who lives in south africa , and a suspected accomplice named gotthard l. , residing in switzerland , are believed to have played a role in an international ring that tried to procure materials for making nuclear weapons in 2001 .
supplying equipment for uranium enrichment prosecutors say w. worked as a mediator in obtaining an order for a south african company to make and supply aluminum tubing to be used in a uranium enrichment plant , the statement said .
he was paid € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- for his services , the office added .
nuclear technology underlies particular secrecy provisions and is classified as a state secret . " according to our current level of knowledge , the tubing was never delivered to libya , " it said .
swiss authorities have searched the home of his alleged accomplice , the 61-year-old l. , and seized documents and bank statements .
" to what extent l. was involved in the international procurement network is still being investigated , " the prosecutor ’ s office said .
libya chooses disarmament in the early 1980s , libya began a program to develop uranium enrichment plants using so-called gas centrifuge technology .
in 1997 , the government decided to import centrifuges and related equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , abdul qadeer khan , has admitted he transferred nuclear technology to libya , iran and north korea .
officials thus made contact with an international illegal procurement network , which mainly did business from dubai in distributing gas centrifuge technology .
abdul qadeer khan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the " father " of pakistan ’ s nuclear bomb , initiated this network in the 1980s .
libya announced late last year that it was abandoning attempts to develop nuclear , biological and chemical weapons and revealed its weapons program to the international atomic energy agency .
officials have thus had access to valuable information , particularly about foreign suppliers . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels moammar gadhafi made his first visit to europe in 15 years .

christian schmidt , parliamentary defense spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats and christian social union , said that the government needed to implement stronger plans detailing the role of german troops in service abroad . as well as changes to the duties of the german kfor troops , other basic considerations " would also have to be put in place for a lengthening of the armed forces ' mandate by parliament , " schmidt said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
he added that the conservatives would be compiling and presenting " a detailed list of questions " relating to the kfor mandate and other deployments around the globe . the german defense ministry issued a statement on thursday saying that german troops actually prevented the loss of life in its view , contradicting the human rights watch report . the defense ministry statement added that it was wrong to describe the german role in the march riots as a " disaster " and stressed that the soldiers operated within lawful boundaries during the violence . assess military success rate , says fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers march in kabul , afghanistan .
other opposition figures challenged the government over the range of foreign deployments and the rationale behind them . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary chairperson of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was quoted by the faz as saying : " the federal government should consider the political and security successes of all the present deployments and show which of their plans have been decisively applied by the armed forces . " gerhardt also criticized the announcement by defense minister peter struck that german soldiers could soon be used again in africa .
struck had recently spoken of germany 's " special responsibility " to the african continent .
" when the german military has 270,000 soldiers and around 8,000 mobilized for missions abroad , i would not say that i could not give support for an extra mission overseas , " struck replied when asked if he would consider sending bundeswehr troops to areas such as sudan if the united nations requested it . possible african mission raises further questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the afghanistan mandate to kunduz has raised questions .
gerhardt said that the government lacked a cohesive concept when it came to the justification of foreign deployments .
missions such as the widened afghanistan mandate in kunduz and the setting up a provisional reconstruction team in the region of faizabad " remain ineffective and serve only as a reassurance , " gerhardt said .
" should an african deployment be deemed necessary , one must really ask whether a clear policy exists in foreign affairs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

" the war against terrorism is more than a set of specific laws , " nicholas howen , secretary general of the international commission of jurists -lrb- icj -rrb- , told a conference in berlin .
" it is a way of thinking . "
he added that this " disturbing rhetoric " assumed that rights and freedoms were a nuisance and interfered with security .
" we witness governments trying to justify torture in the name of national security , detainees held in legal black holes , the right to a fair trial cut down , " howen told more than 150 legal experts at the conference .
arthur chaskalson , the president of the icj , a geneva-based non-governmental organization , said human rights had never been under such threat since the end of the cold war .

" we have already voluntarily implemented the industry-wide reforms that separate research and investment banking , " said deutsche bank spokeswoman rohini pragasam in a statement to reuters . inappropriate working practices from mid-1999 through mid-2001 , deutsche bank " engaged in acts and practices that created or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts , thereby imposing conflicts of interest on research analysts that the firms failed to manage in an adequate or appropriate manner , " the sec regulators said in the statement . the statement went on to explain that deutsche bank " issued research reports that were not based on principles of fair dealing and good faith , and did not provide a sound basis for evaluating facts , contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims about the covered companies , and / or contained opinions for which there were no reasonable bases . " in addition , there were supervisory deficiencies at the bank , according to the regulators .
half of the fines and restitution being paid will go into a fund for their customers ; the other half will go to state securities regulators . bank agrees to walk straight and narrow deutsche bank neither admitted to nor denied the allegations .
it did , however , agree to refrain from future violations and to restrict distributions of hot new stocks to favored company executives and directors , a practice known as " spinning . " the delay of more than a year for the settlement with deutsche bank was caused by its failing to promptly turn over internal e-mails during the investigation , the regulators said , and the firm is paying $ 7.5 million for that alleged lapse as part of the settlement . the $ 87.5 million being paid by deutsche bank also includes a $ 25 million civil fine for alleged conflicts of interest , restitution of $ 25 million , $ 25 million to fund independent securities research and $ 5 million for investor education . wall street giants hit by revelations the probe which led to the investigation into deutsche bank securities , which also included a number of high profile wall street firms , was prompted in part by abuses revealed by new york attorney general eliot spitzer and resulted in a massive $ 1.4 billion settlement that involved investment banking giants , including goldman sachs and merrill lynch . u.s. bank thomas weisel partners also voluntarily agreed to pay damages for many of the same reasons as deutsche bank securities on friday .

christian schmidt , parliamentary defense spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats and christian social union , said that the government needed to implement stronger plans detailing the role of german troops in service abroad . as well as changes to the duties of the german kfor troops , other basic considerations " would also have to be put in place for a lengthening of the armed forces ' mandate by parliament , " schmidt said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
he added that the conservatives would be compiling and presenting " a detailed list of questions " relating to the kfor mandate and other deployments around the globe . the german defense ministry issued a statement on thursday saying that german troops actually prevented the loss of life in its view , contradicting the human rights watch report . the defense ministry statement added that it was wrong to describe the german role in the march riots as a " disaster " and stressed that the soldiers operated within lawful boundaries during the violence . assess military success rate , says fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers march in kabul , afghanistan .
other opposition figures challenged the government over the range of foreign deployments and the rationale behind them . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary chairperson of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was quoted by the faz as saying : " the federal government should consider the political and security successes of all the present deployments and show which of their plans have been decisively applied by the armed forces . " gerhardt also criticized the announcement by defense minister peter struck that german soldiers could soon be used again in africa .
struck had recently spoken of germany 's " special responsibility " to the african continent .
" when the german military has 270,000 soldiers and around 8,000 mobilized for missions abroad , i would not say that i could not give support for an extra mission overseas , " struck replied when asked if he would consider sending bundeswehr troops to areas such as sudan if the united nations requested it . possible african mission raises further questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the afghanistan mandate to kunduz has raised questions .
gerhardt said that the government lacked a cohesive concept when it came to the justification of foreign deployments .
missions such as the widened afghanistan mandate in kunduz and the setting up a provisional reconstruction team in the region of faizabad " remain ineffective and serve only as a reassurance , " gerhardt said .
" should an african deployment be deemed necessary , one must really ask whether a clear policy exists in foreign affairs .

authorities issued an arrest warrant against the 65-year-old for " acting as an accessory to attempted treason " , as well as " aiding the attempted development of atomic weapons " , the office said in a statement .
the judge released the man , identified as gerhard w. , on bail on thursday .
w. , who lives in south africa , and a suspected accomplice named gotthard l. , residing in switzerland , are believed to have played a role in an international ring that tried to procure materials for making nuclear weapons in 2001 .
supplying equipment for uranium enrichment prosecutors say w. worked as a mediator in obtaining an order for a south african company to make and supply aluminum tubing to be used in a uranium enrichment plant , the statement said .
he was paid € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- for his services , the office added .
nuclear technology underlies particular secrecy provisions and is classified as a state secret . " according to our current level of knowledge , the tubing was never delivered to libya , " it said .
swiss authorities have searched the home of his alleged accomplice , the 61-year-old l. , and seized documents and bank statements .
" to what extent l. was involved in the international procurement network is still being investigated , " the prosecutor ’ s office said .
libya chooses disarmament in the early 1980s , libya began a program to develop uranium enrichment plants using so-called gas centrifuge technology .
in 1997 , the government decided to import centrifuges and related equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , abdul qadeer khan , has admitted he transferred nuclear technology to libya , iran and north korea .
officials thus made contact with an international illegal procurement network , which mainly did business from dubai in distributing gas centrifuge technology .
abdul qadeer khan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the " father " of pakistan ’ s nuclear bomb , initiated this network in the 1980s .
libya announced late last year that it was abandoning attempts to develop nuclear , biological and chemical weapons and revealed its weapons program to the international atomic energy agency .
officials have thus had access to valuable information , particularly about foreign suppliers . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels moammar gadhafi made his first visit to europe in 15 years .
the trip was a major step towards normalizing relations with libya following its decision to shun weapons of mass destruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said . " so this exploratory aspect is indeed an important one of the visit , but the road map is the game in town and is the basis of our policy . " a freeze on settlements germany has repeatedly urged israel to freeze its settlement activities while calling on the palestinian authority to initiate security reforms in clear steps that underline their commitment to the road map .
but after the vote in the general assembly in july israel accused eu countries of being biased and threatened freeze europe out of the peace process . on thursday , israel ’ s foreign minister silvan shalom appealed to europe not to support yet another united nations resolution sponsored by the palestinians which called for sanctions against israel over its west bank barrier .
spokesman plötner said the german government has yet to make up its mind . " germany believes – as the european union as a whole does – that israel has the right to defend its citizens against terror and violence .
this having been said we believe that the placing of the barrier beyond the green line inside palestinian territory bears the risk of establishing facts on the ground which will make a peace settlement along the lines of the road map more difficult , " he said . " as for the upcoming vote we have to look at it very carefully to see what exact proposal will be tabled . " palestinians have hinted they will ask the united nations security council in september to consider sanctions or some form of economic punishment against israel citing anti-apartheid boycotts against south africa as a precedent .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

offering € 30,000 in rent for an eight-month stay , she accepted and seagal and crew moved in for the winter . fast forward to 2004 and edeltraud is still , to use the title of one of seagal 's own films , " out for justice " and still paying the price for the martial arts star 's stay at her home .
the landlady has once again appeared before a court in berlin this week to demand damages of € 170,000 from seagal for what has been called the wanton destruction of the property . doors , floors and walls trashed it is alleged that seagal and his crew went on a riot throughout the villa and " disassembled " doors , wooden flooring and wallpaper .
it is also claimed that the " under siege " star and friends ignored the lavatory and urinated every where but . the first attempt to get seagal to cough up for the renovation failed .
the presiding judge ruled that a rent of € 30,000 should be sufficient to cover any wear and tear to the property in an eight week period .
it was also pointed out that while the property was of a higher standard than , say , a motel , it was far from a museum when the action star and his entourage arrived .
therefore , seagal could not be expected to pay the entire amount for renovation on his own . court favors some payment from seagal if proved edeltraud 's second hearing went a little better .
this time the rejection did not come but the court did demand concrete proof that seagal and his posse were indeed those responsible for the mayhem and ensuing damage .
with this proof , the court said , seagal would stand to pay a considerable amount even if it is not the whole € 170,000 demanded .
the judge has suggested a payment similar to the € 30,000 paid for the eight-month rental period back in 2001 . seagal 's lawyers have rejected this out of hand , with the possible outcome being that edeltraud will have to add to her increasing legal bills to get the case into court for a third time .
on top of that , she faces a lawsuit herself .
seagal is suing her for defamation of character , claiming the allegations have damaged his reputation as a person , an actor and a businessman . expensive counter-claim aimed at landlady seagal 's claim is already in the u.s. legal system and should be heard in the next few weeks .
the actor 's lawyers somberly announced recently that the amount of damages their client could expect if the case goes his way , could be more than edeltraud 's villa is actually worth . edeltraud is considering her own counter counter claim .
the whole sorry business , she says , has in fact had damaging consequences on her own reputation and business .
the villa was due to house superstar tom cruise while he films " mission : impossible 3 " in berlin but now , possibly due to the continuing furor over the seagal case , cruise has pulled out .
the thought of staying in a house with alleged seagal pee all over the walls clearly does n't appeal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

in 2004 it was held in helsinki and tallinn … and on a cruise ship . you 'd normally expect a baltic sea cruise to be full of senior citizens looking for some salt air and a full buffet - not a boatload of avant-garde new media artists and musicians .
but then again a cruise organized by the inter-society for electronic arts -lrb- isea -rrb- , a non-profit group that aims to foster interdisciplinary and multicultural discourse for people involved in finding out where exactly art and technology meet , is n't going to be your average trip on the love boat . " the entire ship is an instrument , " said finnish isea organizer tapio mäkelä .
he explained that although the event was somewhat amorphous by nature , the focus in 2004 was on wearable and wireless technologies and their application with various media .
" the whole thing makes sense when you 've gone through it and experienced it all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cruise ship or a floating art platform ?
photo : dw started in the late 1980s in the netherlands , this year 's isea symposium was held last week in the finnish and estonian capitals of helsinki and tallinn .
separated by a stretch of the baltic sea , the two cities were linked by the aforementioned fully wired cruise ship that functioned as a sailing platform for the art exhibitions , concerts and conferences . amorphous exhibition with the symposium 's program ranging from experimental electronic music to interactive clothing , artwork and technology , the two-day cruise afforded participants the opportunity to become better acquainted with each other and the various new media installations onboard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " binary " installation using video and chocolates .
-lrb- photo : tim büsing for dw -rrb- those included an australian collaboration in a real lifeboat dealing with " biological art " , as well as an underwater audio project in the ship 's swimming pool .
another project entitled " float " used incoming data from the ship 's navigation system including distance from nearby islands and the depth of the water to create an ambient soundscape . many of the onboard highlights were the cruise 's musical performances including a set by well-known canadian dj akufen , which predictably drew a large crowd .
however , the djs on the boat were out rocked by live artists such as finland 's zarkus poussa , who combined samples from tv shows like " battlestar galactica " with cheesy 80s synth drums and camp singing . bildunterschrift : a dj set on the boat . german musician felix kubin from hamburg also offered a manic show , heating up the audience with his own unique combination of wild organ playing and analog knob twisting .
he said performing at the isea appealed to him because of its cross-disciplinary and multicultural approach . " it 's great to be able to see what different people from different places are doing musically and artistically , " kubin told dw-world .
" it 's a good type of globalization going on here . " kubin has long been involved in efforts to break down cultural barriers .
his latest project involves setting up a mobile bilingual german-polish radio station broadcasting both to air and on the internet that will eventually travel through the two countries for half a year focusing on music and culture . pushing boundaries kubin 's attitude toward his live performance fit well with the basic idea behind the whole isea event : see how far the boundaries of new media art and music are being pushed by others in order to push them even further yourself . but the floating media platform did n't necessarily agree with all of the participants .
japanese artist and musician yoshio machida said his performance suffered at the unconventional venue on the cruise ship 's deck . " normally i play in a more quiet place - it 's a bit noisy here , " machida said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " seven mile boots " by laura beloff , erich berger and martin pichlmair .

back on dry land in tallinn , artists focused on the wearable and the wireless .
one finnish-austrian collaboration came up with a pair of so-called " seven mile boots " that were connected to internet chat rooms .
while in cyberspace , the boots would convert the text of chat room users to speech so the wearer could hear what was being discussed .
but with each step the wearer would switch chat rooms miles apart entering other internet conversations around the globe . interactive , inflatable another group of swedish and american artists going by the moniker " millefiore effect " came up with inflating clothes that respond to yelling .
plastic horns and other parts of the outfits puff up as the wearers scream to symbolize anger and aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the week of music and new media art wrapped up in helsinki with club events , conferences and an exhibition at the city 's spectacular kiasma museum of modern art .
there visitors came across a number of novel installations such as hanna haaslahti 's " scramble suit " .
the finnish artist 's work confronts people with a real-time projection of their own image with is simultaneously attacked by a kinetic shadow monster that attempts to take over the image . the real-time interaction with technology was also a reoccurring theme during the seminars in helsinki .
that included technologies really not usually thought of being suitable for artistic projects such as the global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- that relies on satellites to pinpoint locations on earth . " it 's all about mixing the physical with the virtual , " said joel slayton , an american using gps to combine mapping of actual landscapes with conceptual and physical interaction . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma berlin exhibition slammed unhappy with the long entrance lines , art fans are directing criticism at the organizers of berlin 's moma exhibition .

that e-mail from your bank may be more than a friendly enquiry .
it could be the hook of a phisher , the new breed of internet fraudster intent on stealing money by tricking customers into divulging online account details . private banking has never been so easy in germany , thanks , in part to the internet .
it is estimated that a third of all germans bank online and the numbers are growing .
but the lower costs and conveniences associated with online banking come at a price .
and that price is quite high , especially when computer hackers are involved . having to deal with junk mail is just one of the many unfortunate internet realities .
most of it is harmless .
but some isn ’ t . many germans have had to experience this the hard way recently after opening , what they thought , were serious emails from their banks .
they clicked on links they thought were associated with their banks and divulged sensitive financial data .
unfortunately , they were caught hook , line and sinker by a worrying new trend in internet hacking known as phishing . germany banks recently targeted according to experts , these specialist internet fraudsters , now known as " phishers , " are able to convince up to 5 percent of recipients to respond to such bogus emails .
the focus so far in germany has been on people with online auction site ebay , deutsche bank and postbank accounts .
a fresh wave of e-mails , purporting to come from deutsche bank , emerged last weekend and tuesday night .
germany 's biggest bank quickly moved to disable the fake web sites . while the banks claim that no customers lost any money , in certain instances elsewhere , the phishers have landed a big one .
but the authorities are now aware of the scams and are doing their best to alert their customers . phony links to phony websites dieter schürmann heads a department on internet fraud at the state policing agency in düsseldorf .
“ the people aren ’ t activating a link to their banks , " he told dw-radio .
" they ’ re activating links to phony web sites that are run by criminals and look extremely authentic .
they ’ re using the account information to rob people of their money . ” “ people have lost money but not to the same extent as in the united states .
as is often the case , these kinds of developments slowly make their way over the atlantic and it ’ s not the banks that are taking the hit but the people themselves , ” schürmann said . in the united states alone , it is estimated that internet fraud was a $ 1 billion plus industry last year . and a lot of the damages hitting germany stem from fraud originating in the us .
in june this year , 1,422 separate phishing attacks were recorded , mostly focused on the united states .
this figure showed a huge increase from the 176 cases reported in january , according to the anti-phishing working group , a financial services industry task force based in the us . but schürmann thinks that there are ways to fight back : “ it ’ s easier to fight crime in the digital world than in the analogue world , " he said .
" fraudulent web sites usually exist online for no longer than around 50 hours before they disappear for ever , but we nevertheless have a decent chance of tracking down where the web sites originated . ” simple advice in the end , schürmann says that the best way to fight internet fraud is simply to ignore and erase any suspicious e mails : “ as a rule of thumb , people shouldn ’ t click onto links they ’ re unsure of . we recommend that people do their telebanking by logging on to the web sites of the banks directly . ” and if that doesn ’ t work , there ’ s also another way preventing web criminals from making unauthorized withdrawals . and that ’ s by banking in person .
it may not be as sexy as operating a high-speed modem , but it may be a little safer in the end .

authorities issued an arrest warrant against the 65-year-old for " acting as an accessory to attempted treason " , as well as " aiding the attempted development of atomic weapons " , the office said in a statement .
the judge released the man , identified as gerhard w. , on bail on thursday .
w. , who lives in south africa , and a suspected accomplice named gotthard l. , residing in switzerland , are believed to have played a role in an international ring that tried to procure materials for making nuclear weapons in 2001 .
supplying equipment for uranium enrichment prosecutors say w. worked as a mediator in obtaining an order for a south african company to make and supply aluminum tubing to be used in a uranium enrichment plant , the statement said .
he was paid € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- for his services , the office added .
nuclear technology underlies particular secrecy provisions and is classified as a state secret . " according to our current level of knowledge , the tubing was never delivered to libya , " it said .
swiss authorities have searched the home of his alleged accomplice , the 61-year-old l. , and seized documents and bank statements .
" to what extent l. was involved in the international procurement network is still being investigated , " the prosecutor ’ s office said .
libya chooses disarmament in the early 1980s , libya began a program to develop uranium enrichment plants using so-called gas centrifuge technology .
in 1997 , the government decided to import centrifuges and related equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , abdul qadeer khan , has admitted he transferred nuclear technology to libya , iran and north korea .
officials thus made contact with an international illegal procurement network , which mainly did business from dubai in distributing gas centrifuge technology .
abdul qadeer khan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the " father " of pakistan ’ s nuclear bomb , initiated this network in the 1980s .
libya announced late last year that it was abandoning attempts to develop nuclear , biological and chemical weapons and revealed its weapons program to the international atomic energy agency .

in 2004 it was held in helsinki and tallinn … and on a cruise ship . you 'd normally expect a baltic sea cruise to be full of senior citizens looking for some salt air and a full buffet - not a boatload of avant-garde new media artists and musicians .
but then again a cruise organized by the inter-society for electronic arts -lrb- isea -rrb- , a non-profit group that aims to foster interdisciplinary and multicultural discourse for people involved in finding out where exactly art and technology meet , is n't going to be your average trip on the love boat . " the entire ship is an instrument , " said finnish isea organizer tapio mäkelä .
he explained that although the event was somewhat amorphous by nature , the focus in 2004 was on wearable and wireless technologies and their application with various media .
" the whole thing makes sense when you 've gone through it and experienced it all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cruise ship or a floating art platform ?
photo : dw started in the late 1980s in the netherlands , this year 's isea symposium was held last week in the finnish and estonian capitals of helsinki and tallinn .
separated by a stretch of the baltic sea , the two cities were linked by the aforementioned fully wired cruise ship that functioned as a sailing platform for the art exhibitions , concerts and conferences . amorphous exhibition with the symposium 's program ranging from experimental electronic music to interactive clothing , artwork and technology , the two-day cruise afforded participants the opportunity to become better acquainted with each other and the various new media installations onboard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " binary " installation using video and chocolates .
-lrb- photo : tim büsing for dw -rrb- those included an australian collaboration in a real lifeboat dealing with " biological art " , as well as an underwater audio project in the ship 's swimming pool .
another project entitled " float " used incoming data from the ship 's navigation system including distance from nearby islands and the depth of the water to create an ambient soundscape . many of the onboard highlights were the cruise 's musical performances including a set by well-known canadian dj akufen , which predictably drew a large crowd .
however , the djs on the boat were out rocked by live artists such as finland 's zarkus poussa , who combined samples from tv shows like " battlestar galactica " with cheesy 80s synth drums and camp singing . bildunterschrift : a dj set on the boat . german musician felix kubin from hamburg also offered a manic show , heating up the audience with his own unique combination of wild organ playing and analog knob twisting .
he said performing at the isea appealed to him because of its cross-disciplinary and multicultural approach . " it 's great to be able to see what different people from different places are doing musically and artistically , " kubin told dw-world .
" it 's a good type of globalization going on here . " kubin has long been involved in efforts to break down cultural barriers .
his latest project involves setting up a mobile bilingual german-polish radio station broadcasting both to air and on the internet that will eventually travel through the two countries for half a year focusing on music and culture . pushing boundaries kubin 's attitude toward his live performance fit well with the basic idea behind the whole isea event : see how far the boundaries of new media art and music are being pushed by others in order to push them even further yourself . but the floating media platform did n't necessarily agree with all of the participants .
japanese artist and musician yoshio machida said his performance suffered at the unconventional venue on the cruise ship 's deck . " normally i play in a more quiet place - it 's a bit noisy here , " machida said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " seven mile boots " by laura beloff , erich berger and martin pichlmair .

back on dry land in tallinn , artists focused on the wearable and the wireless .
one finnish-austrian collaboration came up with a pair of so-called " seven mile boots " that were connected to internet chat rooms .
while in cyberspace , the boots would convert the text of chat room users to speech so the wearer could hear what was being discussed .
but with each step the wearer would switch chat rooms miles apart entering other internet conversations around the globe . interactive , inflatable another group of swedish and american artists going by the moniker " millefiore effect " came up with inflating clothes that respond to yelling .
plastic horns and other parts of the outfits puff up as the wearers scream to symbolize anger and aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the week of music and new media art wrapped up in helsinki with club events , conferences and an exhibition at the city 's spectacular kiasma museum of modern art .
there visitors came across a number of novel installations such as hanna haaslahti 's " scramble suit " .
the finnish artist 's work confronts people with a real-time projection of their own image with is simultaneously attacked by a kinetic shadow monster that attempts to take over the image . the real-time interaction with technology was also a reoccurring theme during the seminars in helsinki .
that included technologies really not usually thought of being suitable for artistic projects such as the global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- that relies on satellites to pinpoint locations on earth .

christian schmidt , parliamentary defense spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats and christian social union , said that the government needed to implement stronger plans detailing the role of german troops in service abroad . as well as changes to the duties of the german kfor troops , other basic considerations " would also have to be put in place for a lengthening of the armed forces ' mandate by parliament , " schmidt said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
he added that the conservatives would be compiling and presenting " a detailed list of questions " relating to the kfor mandate and other deployments around the globe . the german defense ministry issued a statement on thursday saying that german troops actually prevented the loss of life in its view , contradicting the human rights watch report . the defense ministry statement added that it was wrong to describe the german role in the march riots as a " disaster " and stressed that the soldiers operated within lawful boundaries during the violence . assess military success rate , says fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers march in kabul , afghanistan .
other opposition figures challenged the government over the range of foreign deployments and the rationale behind them . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary chairperson of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was quoted by the faz as saying : " the federal government should consider the political and security successes of all the present deployments and show which of their plans have been decisively applied by the armed forces . " gerhardt also criticized the announcement by defense minister peter struck that german soldiers could soon be used again in africa .
struck had recently spoken of germany 's " special responsibility " to the african continent .
" when the german military has 270,000 soldiers and around 8,000 mobilized for missions abroad , i would not say that i could not give support for an extra mission overseas , " struck replied when asked if he would consider sending bundeswehr troops to areas such as sudan if the united nations requested it . possible african mission raises further questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the afghanistan mandate to kunduz has raised questions .
gerhardt said that the government lacked a cohesive concept when it came to the justification of foreign deployments .
missions such as the widened afghanistan mandate in kunduz and the setting up a provisional reconstruction team in the region of faizabad " remain ineffective and serve only as a reassurance , " gerhardt said .
" should an african deployment be deemed necessary , one must really ask whether a clear policy exists in foreign affairs .

the landlady has once again appeared before a court in berlin this week to demand damages of € 170,000 from seagal for what has been called the wanton destruction of the property . doors , floors and walls trashed it is alleged that seagal and his crew went on a riot throughout the villa and " disassembled " doors , wooden flooring and wallpaper .

with this proof , the court said , seagal would stand to pay a considerable amount even if it is not the whole € 170,000 demanded .
the judge has suggested a payment similar to the € 30,000 paid for the eight-month rental period back in 2001 . seagal 's lawyers have rejected this out of hand , with the possible outcome being that edeltraud will have to add to her increasing legal bills to get the case into court for a third time .
on top of that , she faces a lawsuit herself .
seagal is suing her for defamation of character , claiming the allegations have damaged his reputation as a person , an actor and a businessman . expensive counter-claim aimed at landlady seagal 's claim is already in the u.s. legal system and should be heard in the next few weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 fischer starts middle east tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does sharon really want to see fischer again ?
german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said . " so this exploratory aspect is indeed an important one of the visit , but the road map is the game in town and is the basis of our policy . " a freeze on settlements germany has repeatedly urged israel to freeze its settlement activities while calling on the palestinian authority to initiate security reforms in clear steps that underline their commitment to the road map .
but after the vote in the general assembly in july israel accused eu countries of being biased and threatened freeze europe out of the peace process . on thursday , israel ’ s foreign minister silvan shalom appealed to europe not to support yet another united nations resolution sponsored by the palestinians which called for sanctions against israel over its west bank barrier .
spokesman plötner said the german government has yet to make up its mind . " germany believes – as the european union as a whole does – that israel has the right to defend its citizens against terror and violence .
this having been said we believe that the placing of the barrier beyond the green line inside palestinian territory bears the risk of establishing facts on the ground which will make a peace settlement along the lines of the road map more difficult , " he said . " as for the upcoming vote we have to look at it very carefully to see what exact proposal will be tabled . " palestinians have hinted they will ask the united nations security council in september to consider sanctions or some form of economic punishment against israel citing anti-apartheid boycotts against south africa as a precedent .
but foreign minister fischer , mindful of his role as a peace broker in the region – is unlikely to support such a drastic move . uwe hessler -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel criticizes europe for un resolution the palestinians won a victory against israel at the un in new york on tuesday when the body voted against the so-called " west bank barrier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

" the war against terrorism is more than a set of specific laws , " nicholas howen , secretary general of the international commission of jurists -lrb- icj -rrb- , told a conference in berlin .
" it is a way of thinking . "
he added that this " disturbing rhetoric " assumed that rights and freedoms were a nuisance and interfered with security .
" we witness governments trying to justify torture in the name of national security , detainees held in legal black holes , the right to a fair trial cut down , " howen told more than 150 legal experts at the conference .
arthur chaskalson , the president of the icj , a geneva-based non-governmental organization , said human rights had never been under such threat since the end of the cold war .

speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .

christian schmidt , parliamentary defense spokesman for the conservative opposition christian democrats and christian social union , said that the government needed to implement stronger plans detailing the role of german troops in service abroad . as well as changes to the duties of the german kfor troops , other basic considerations " would also have to be put in place for a lengthening of the armed forces ' mandate by parliament , " schmidt said in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
he added that the conservatives would be compiling and presenting " a detailed list of questions " relating to the kfor mandate and other deployments around the globe . the german defense ministry issued a statement on thursday saying that german troops actually prevented the loss of life in its view , contradicting the human rights watch report . the defense ministry statement added that it was wrong to describe the german role in the march riots as a " disaster " and stressed that the soldiers operated within lawful boundaries during the violence . assess military success rate , says fdp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers march in kabul , afghanistan .
other opposition figures challenged the government over the range of foreign deployments and the rationale behind them . wolfgang gerhardt , parliamentary chairperson of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , was quoted by the faz as saying : " the federal government should consider the political and security successes of all the present deployments and show which of their plans have been decisively applied by the armed forces . " gerhardt also criticized the announcement by defense minister peter struck that german soldiers could soon be used again in africa .
struck had recently spoken of germany 's " special responsibility " to the african continent .
" when the german military has 270,000 soldiers and around 8,000 mobilized for missions abroad , i would not say that i could not give support for an extra mission overseas , " struck replied when asked if he would consider sending bundeswehr troops to areas such as sudan if the united nations requested it . possible african mission raises further questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extending the afghanistan mandate to kunduz has raised questions .
gerhardt said that the government lacked a cohesive concept when it came to the justification of foreign deployments .
missions such as the widened afghanistan mandate in kunduz and the setting up a provisional reconstruction team in the region of faizabad " remain ineffective and serve only as a reassurance , " gerhardt said .
" should an african deployment be deemed necessary , one must really ask whether a clear policy exists in foreign affairs .

authorities issued an arrest warrant against the 65-year-old for " acting as an accessory to attempted treason " , as well as " aiding the attempted development of atomic weapons " , the office said in a statement .
the judge released the man , identified as gerhard w. , on bail on thursday .
w. , who lives in south africa , and a suspected accomplice named gotthard l. , residing in switzerland , are believed to have played a role in an international ring that tried to procure materials for making nuclear weapons in 2001 .
supplying equipment for uranium enrichment prosecutors say w. worked as a mediator in obtaining an order for a south african company to make and supply aluminum tubing to be used in a uranium enrichment plant , the statement said .
he was paid € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- for his services , the office added .
nuclear technology underlies particular secrecy provisions and is classified as a state secret . " according to our current level of knowledge , the tubing was never delivered to libya , " it said .
swiss authorities have searched the home of his alleged accomplice , the 61-year-old l. , and seized documents and bank statements .
" to what extent l. was involved in the international procurement network is still being investigated , " the prosecutor ’ s office said .

abdul qadeer khan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the " father " of pakistan ’ s nuclear bomb , initiated this network in the 1980s .

offering € 30,000 in rent for an eight-month stay , she accepted and seagal and crew moved in for the winter . fast forward to 2004 and edeltraud is still , to use the title of one of seagal 's own films , " out for justice " and still paying the price for the martial arts star 's stay at her home .
the landlady has once again appeared before a court in berlin this week to demand damages of € 170,000 from seagal for what has been called the wanton destruction of the property . doors , floors and walls trashed it is alleged that seagal and his crew went on a riot throughout the villa and " disassembled " doors , wooden flooring and wallpaper .
it is also claimed that the " under siege " star and friends ignored the lavatory and urinated every where but . the first attempt to get seagal to cough up for the renovation failed .
the presiding judge ruled that a rent of € 30,000 should be sufficient to cover any wear and tear to the property in an eight week period .
it was also pointed out that while the property was of a higher standard than , say , a motel , it was far from a museum when the action star and his entourage arrived .
therefore , seagal could not be expected to pay the entire amount for renovation on his own . court favors some payment from seagal if proved edeltraud 's second hearing went a little better .
this time the rejection did not come but the court did demand concrete proof that seagal and his posse were indeed those responsible for the mayhem and ensuing damage .
with this proof , the court said , seagal would stand to pay a considerable amount even if it is not the whole € 170,000 demanded .
the judge has suggested a payment similar to the € 30,000 paid for the eight-month rental period back in 2001 . seagal 's lawyers have rejected this out of hand , with the possible outcome being that edeltraud will have to add to her increasing legal bills to get the case into court for a third time .
on top of that , she faces a lawsuit herself .
seagal is suing her for defamation of character , claiming the allegations have damaged his reputation as a person , an actor and a businessman . expensive counter-claim aimed at landlady seagal 's claim is already in the u.s. legal system and should be heard in the next few weeks .
the actor 's lawyers somberly announced recently that the amount of damages their client could expect if the case goes his way , could be more than edeltraud 's villa is actually worth . edeltraud is considering her own counter counter claim .
the whole sorry business , she says , has in fact had damaging consequences on her own reputation and business .
the villa was due to house superstar tom cruise while he films " mission : impossible 3 " in berlin but now , possibly due to the continuing furor over the seagal case , cruise has pulled out .
the thought of staying in a house with alleged seagal pee all over the walls clearly does n't appeal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said . " so this exploratory aspect is indeed an important one of the visit , but the road map is the game in town and is the basis of our policy . " a freeze on settlements germany has repeatedly urged israel to freeze its settlement activities while calling on the palestinian authority to initiate security reforms in clear steps that underline their commitment to the road map .
but after the vote in the general assembly in july israel accused eu countries of being biased and threatened freeze europe out of the peace process . on thursday , israel ’ s foreign minister silvan shalom appealed to europe not to support yet another united nations resolution sponsored by the palestinians which called for sanctions against israel over its west bank barrier .
spokesman plötner said the german government has yet to make up its mind . " germany believes – as the european union as a whole does – that israel has the right to defend its citizens against terror and violence .
this having been said we believe that the placing of the barrier beyond the green line inside palestinian territory bears the risk of establishing facts on the ground which will make a peace settlement along the lines of the road map more difficult , " he said . " as for the upcoming vote we have to look at it very carefully to see what exact proposal will be tabled . " palestinians have hinted they will ask the united nations security council in september to consider sanctions or some form of economic punishment against israel citing anti-apartheid boycotts against south africa as a precedent .
but foreign minister fischer , mindful of his role as a peace broker in the region – is unlikely to support such a drastic move . uwe hessler -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel criticizes europe for un resolution the palestinians won a victory against israel at the un in new york on tuesday when the body voted against the so-called " west bank barrier .

in 2004 it was held in helsinki and tallinn … and on a cruise ship . you 'd normally expect a baltic sea cruise to be full of senior citizens looking for some salt air and a full buffet - not a boatload of avant-garde new media artists and musicians .
but then again a cruise organized by the inter-society for electronic arts -lrb- isea -rrb- , a non-profit group that aims to foster interdisciplinary and multicultural discourse for people involved in finding out where exactly art and technology meet , is n't going to be your average trip on the love boat . " the entire ship is an instrument , " said finnish isea organizer tapio mäkelä .
he explained that although the event was somewhat amorphous by nature , the focus in 2004 was on wearable and wireless technologies and their application with various media .
" the whole thing makes sense when you 've gone through it and experienced it all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cruise ship or a floating art platform ?
photo : dw started in the late 1980s in the netherlands , this year 's isea symposium was held last week in the finnish and estonian capitals of helsinki and tallinn .
separated by a stretch of the baltic sea , the two cities were linked by the aforementioned fully wired cruise ship that functioned as a sailing platform for the art exhibitions , concerts and conferences . amorphous exhibition with the symposium 's program ranging from experimental electronic music to interactive clothing , artwork and technology , the two-day cruise afforded participants the opportunity to become better acquainted with each other and the various new media installations onboard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " binary " installation using video and chocolates .
-lrb- photo : tim büsing for dw -rrb- those included an australian collaboration in a real lifeboat dealing with " biological art " , as well as an underwater audio project in the ship 's swimming pool .
another project entitled " float " used incoming data from the ship 's navigation system including distance from nearby islands and the depth of the water to create an ambient soundscape . many of the onboard highlights were the cruise 's musical performances including a set by well-known canadian dj akufen , which predictably drew a large crowd .
however , the djs on the boat were out rocked by live artists such as finland 's zarkus poussa , who combined samples from tv shows like " battlestar galactica " with cheesy 80s synth drums and camp singing . bildunterschrift : a dj set on the boat . german musician felix kubin from hamburg also offered a manic show , heating up the audience with his own unique combination of wild organ playing and analog knob twisting .
he said performing at the isea appealed to him because of its cross-disciplinary and multicultural approach . " it 's great to be able to see what different people from different places are doing musically and artistically , " kubin told dw-world .
" it 's a good type of globalization going on here . " kubin has long been involved in efforts to break down cultural barriers .
his latest project involves setting up a mobile bilingual german-polish radio station broadcasting both to air and on the internet that will eventually travel through the two countries for half a year focusing on music and culture . pushing boundaries kubin 's attitude toward his live performance fit well with the basic idea behind the whole isea event : see how far the boundaries of new media art and music are being pushed by others in order to push them even further yourself . but the floating media platform did n't necessarily agree with all of the participants .
japanese artist and musician yoshio machida said his performance suffered at the unconventional venue on the cruise ship 's deck . " normally i play in a more quiet place - it 's a bit noisy here , " machida said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " seven mile boots " by laura beloff , erich berger and martin pichlmair .

back on dry land in tallinn , artists focused on the wearable and the wireless .
one finnish-austrian collaboration came up with a pair of so-called " seven mile boots " that were connected to internet chat rooms .
while in cyberspace , the boots would convert the text of chat room users to speech so the wearer could hear what was being discussed .
but with each step the wearer would switch chat rooms miles apart entering other internet conversations around the globe . interactive , inflatable another group of swedish and american artists going by the moniker " millefiore effect " came up with inflating clothes that respond to yelling .
plastic horns and other parts of the outfits puff up as the wearers scream to symbolize anger and aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the week of music and new media art wrapped up in helsinki with club events , conferences and an exhibition at the city 's spectacular kiasma museum of modern art .
there visitors came across a number of novel installations such as hanna haaslahti 's " scramble suit " .
the finnish artist 's work confronts people with a real-time projection of their own image with is simultaneously attacked by a kinetic shadow monster that attempts to take over the image . the real-time interaction with technology was also a reoccurring theme during the seminars in helsinki .
that included technologies really not usually thought of being suitable for artistic projects such as the global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- that relies on satellites to pinpoint locations on earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .

government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .

speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics .

offering € 30,000 in rent for an eight-month stay , she accepted and seagal and crew moved in for the winter . fast forward to 2004 and edeltraud is still , to use the title of one of seagal 's own films , " out for justice " and still paying the price for the martial arts star 's stay at her home .
the landlady has once again appeared before a court in berlin this week to demand damages of € 170,000 from seagal for what has been called the wanton destruction of the property . doors , floors and walls trashed it is alleged that seagal and his crew went on a riot throughout the villa and " disassembled " doors , wooden flooring and wallpaper .
it is also claimed that the " under siege " star and friends ignored the lavatory and urinated every where but . the first attempt to get seagal to cough up for the renovation failed .
the presiding judge ruled that a rent of € 30,000 should be sufficient to cover any wear and tear to the property in an eight week period .

the presiding judge ruled that a rent of € 30,000 should be sufficient to cover any wear and tear to the property in an eight week period .
it was also pointed out that while the property was of a higher standard than , say , a motel , it was far from a museum when the action star and his entourage arrived .
therefore , seagal could not be expected to pay the entire amount for renovation on his own . court favors some payment from seagal if proved edeltraud 's second hearing went a little better .
this time the rejection did not come but the court did demand concrete proof that seagal and his posse were indeed those responsible for the mayhem and ensuing damage .
with this proof , the court said , seagal would stand to pay a considerable amount even if it is not the whole € 170,000 demanded .
the judge has suggested a payment similar to the € 30,000 paid for the eight-month rental period back in 2001 . seagal 's lawyers have rejected this out of hand , with the possible outcome being that edeltraud will have to add to her increasing legal bills to get the case into court for a third time .
on top of that , she faces a lawsuit herself .
seagal is suing her for defamation of character , claiming the allegations have damaged his reputation as a person , an actor and a businessman . expensive counter-claim aimed at landlady seagal 's claim is already in the u.s. legal system and should be heard in the next few weeks .
the actor 's lawyers somberly announced recently that the amount of damages their client could expect if the case goes his way , could be more than edeltraud 's villa is actually worth . edeltraud is considering her own counter counter claim .
the whole sorry business , she says , has in fact had damaging consequences on her own reputation and business .
the villa was due to house superstar tom cruise while he films " mission : impossible 3 " in berlin but now , possibly due to the continuing furor over the seagal case , cruise has pulled out .
the thought of staying in a house with alleged seagal pee all over the walls clearly does n't appeal . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the very best of and finally ...

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said . " so this exploratory aspect is indeed an important one of the visit , but the road map is the game in town and is the basis of our policy . " a freeze on settlements germany has repeatedly urged israel to freeze its settlement activities while calling on the palestinian authority to initiate security reforms in clear steps that underline their commitment to the road map .
but after the vote in the general assembly in july israel accused eu countries of being biased and threatened freeze europe out of the peace process . on thursday , israel ’ s foreign minister silvan shalom appealed to europe not to support yet another united nations resolution sponsored by the palestinians which called for sanctions against israel over its west bank barrier .
spokesman plötner said the german government has yet to make up its mind . " germany believes – as the european union as a whole does – that israel has the right to defend its citizens against terror and violence .
this having been said we believe that the placing of the barrier beyond the green line inside palestinian territory bears the risk of establishing facts on the ground which will make a peace settlement along the lines of the road map more difficult , " he said . " as for the upcoming vote we have to look at it very carefully to see what exact proposal will be tabled . " palestinians have hinted they will ask the united nations security council in september to consider sanctions or some form of economic punishment against israel citing anti-apartheid boycotts against south africa as a precedent .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .

german foreign minister joschka fischer has embarked on a five-day , five-nation tour of the middle east focusing on the israeli and the palestinian conflict and economic and political modernization in the region . fischer started his trip in lebanon on friday and will then travel to syria , jordan , israel and the palestinian territories and finally egypt .
the german foreign minister has long been perceived as an honest broker by the protagonists in the middle east conflict , but his role is becoming more difficult in view of ongoing tensions in the region . " two states side by side - i see no other positive alternative , " fischer said referring to israel and an eventual sovereign palestine after landing in beirut . his five-day visit to the middle east comes at a time of ongoing violence in the region .
the peace process has been stalled for several months .
in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .

in addition , the minister ’ s reputation in israel has been tarnished since germany backed a united nations general assembly resolution in july condemning israel ’ s border fence in the west bank . all european union member states endorsed the resolution which stated that the parts of 600-kilometer barrier built on palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down .
in the eyes of the german government , tensions have also been fuelled by jerusalem ’ s decision to expand existing jewish settlements in the west bank .
german foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner said fischer will be trying to unblock the peace process , known as road map , against all odds . " the situation in the region is critical .
we are seeing the continuation of violence and of terror .
and one of the aims of the visit of mr fischer is to explore possibilities of kick-starting the roadmap process and getting the road map back on track by determining with the parties in the region how best to do this , " plötner said . " so this exploratory aspect is indeed an important one of the visit , but the road map is the game in town and is the basis of our policy . " a freeze on settlements germany has repeatedly urged israel to freeze its settlement activities while calling on the palestinian authority to initiate security reforms in clear steps that underline their commitment to the road map .
but after the vote in the general assembly in july israel accused eu countries of being biased and threatened freeze europe out of the peace process . on thursday , israel ’ s foreign minister silvan shalom appealed to europe not to support yet another united nations resolution sponsored by the palestinians which called for sanctions against israel over its west bank barrier .
spokesman plötner said the german government has yet to make up its mind . " germany believes – as the european union as a whole does – that israel has the right to defend its citizens against terror and violence .
this having been said we believe that the placing of the barrier beyond the green line inside palestinian territory bears the risk of establishing facts on the ground which will make a peace settlement along the lines of the road map more difficult , " he said . " as for the upcoming vote we have to look at it very carefully to see what exact proposal will be tabled . " palestinians have hinted they will ask the united nations security council in september to consider sanctions or some form of economic punishment against israel citing anti-apartheid boycotts against south africa as a precedent .
but foreign minister fischer , mindful of his role as a peace broker in the region – is unlikely to support such a drastic move . uwe hessler -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel criticizes europe for un resolution the palestinians won a victory against israel at the un in new york on tuesday when the body voted against the so-called " west bank barrier .
but israel had angry words for its neighbors and europe a day later .

offering € 30,000 in rent for an eight-month stay , she accepted and seagal and crew moved in for the winter . fast forward to 2004 and edeltraud is still , to use the title of one of seagal 's own films , " out for justice " and still paying the price for the martial arts star 's stay at her home .
the landlady has once again appeared before a court in berlin this week to demand damages of € 170,000 from seagal for what has been called the wanton destruction of the property . doors , floors and walls trashed it is alleged that seagal and his crew went on a riot throughout the villa and " disassembled " doors , wooden flooring and wallpaper .
it is also claimed that the " under siege " star and friends ignored the lavatory and urinated every where but . the first attempt to get seagal to cough up for the renovation failed .
the presiding judge ruled that a rent of € 30,000 should be sufficient to cover any wear and tear to the property in an eight week period .
it was also pointed out that while the property was of a higher standard than , say , a motel , it was far from a museum when the action star and his entourage arrived .
therefore , seagal could not be expected to pay the entire amount for renovation on his own . court favors some payment from seagal if proved edeltraud 's second hearing went a little better .
this time the rejection did not come but the court did demand concrete proof that seagal and his posse were indeed those responsible for the mayhem and ensuing damage .
with this proof , the court said , seagal would stand to pay a considerable amount even if it is not the whole € 170,000 demanded .
the judge has suggested a payment similar to the € 30,000 paid for the eight-month rental period back in 2001 . seagal 's lawyers have rejected this out of hand , with the possible outcome being that edeltraud will have to add to her increasing legal bills to get the case into court for a third time .
on top of that , she faces a lawsuit herself .
seagal is suing her for defamation of character , claiming the allegations have damaged his reputation as a person , an actor and a businessman . expensive counter-claim aimed at landlady seagal 's claim is already in the u.s. legal system and should be heard in the next few weeks .
the actor 's lawyers somberly announced recently that the amount of damages their client could expect if the case goes his way , could be more than edeltraud 's villa is actually worth . edeltraud is considering her own counter counter claim .
the whole sorry business , she says , has in fact had damaging consequences on her own reputation and business .
the villa was due to house superstar tom cruise while he films " mission : impossible 3 " in berlin but now , possibly due to the continuing furor over the seagal case , cruise has pulled out .

offering € 30,000 in rent for an eight-month stay , she accepted and seagal and crew moved in for the winter . fast forward to 2004 and edeltraud is still , to use the title of one of seagal 's own films , " out for justice " and still paying the price for the martial arts star 's stay at her home .
the landlady has once again appeared before a court in berlin this week to demand damages of € 170,000 from seagal for what has been called the wanton destruction of the property . doors , floors and walls trashed it is alleged that seagal and his crew went on a riot throughout the villa and " disassembled " doors , wooden flooring and wallpaper .
it is also claimed that the " under siege " star and friends ignored the lavatory and urinated every where but . the first attempt to get seagal to cough up for the renovation failed .
the presiding judge ruled that a rent of € 30,000 should be sufficient to cover any wear and tear to the property in an eight week period .
it was also pointed out that while the property was of a higher standard than , say , a motel , it was far from a museum when the action star and his entourage arrived .
therefore , seagal could not be expected to pay the entire amount for renovation on his own . court favors some payment from seagal if proved edeltraud 's second hearing went a little better .
this time the rejection did not come but the court did demand concrete proof that seagal and his posse were indeed those responsible for the mayhem and ensuing damage .
with this proof , the court said , seagal would stand to pay a considerable amount even if it is not the whole € 170,000 demanded .
the judge has suggested a payment similar to the € 30,000 paid for the eight-month rental period back in 2001 . seagal 's lawyers have rejected this out of hand , with the possible outcome being that edeltraud will have to add to her increasing legal bills to get the case into court for a third time .
on top of that , she faces a lawsuit herself .
seagal is suing her for defamation of character , claiming the allegations have damaged his reputation as a person , an actor and a businessman . expensive counter-claim aimed at landlady seagal 's claim is already in the u.s. legal system and should be heard in the next few weeks .
the actor 's lawyers somberly announced recently that the amount of damages their client could expect if the case goes his way , could be more than edeltraud 's villa is actually worth . edeltraud is considering her own counter counter claim .
the whole sorry business , she says , has in fact had damaging consequences on her own reputation and business .
the villa was due to house superstar tom cruise while he films " mission : impossible 3 " in berlin but now , possibly due to the continuing furor over the seagal case , cruise has pulled out .

gfk 's september index of consumer sentiment , which aims to forecast household spending a month in advance , fell to 2.0 from a revised 3.0 in july , the nuremberg-based market research company said according to bloomberg news .

gfk said that household spending , the largest part of the economy , ca n't be expected to contribute to growth this year .
" unemployment has to fall if people are going to start saving less , " gfk chief executive officer klaus wübbenhorst told bloomberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2004 anti-aids groups face new challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devastating disease german anti-aids campaigners cite the increase in new infections among younger germans as a disturbing new development and criticize the government 's health-care reforms . one week ahead of a national aids prevention conference in berlin , german health minister ulla schmidt presented a mixed picture regarding the spread of aids in germany .
speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics . " an unbearable burden meanwhile , germany 's premier aid organization for hiv / aids patients says the government 's health care reforms have created an extra , sometimes unbearable , burden for those infected with the virus . as its annual conference got underway on thursday , deutsche aidshilfe , an umbrella group of around 130 local german hiv / aids groups , said the government 's health-care reforms forced more and more infected people into poverty .
according to rainer jarchow , managing board member with deutsche aidshilfe , the changes were carried through at the expense of the chronically sick , handicapped and poor . although public health funds still pay for the costs of aids therapy , including some prescription drugs , since the reforms were implemented in january the funds do n't cover over-the-counter drugs anymore .
yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .
experts believe that the eu 's eastward enlargement could abruptly end germans ' complacency and their belief that they are safe from aids . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany struggles with healthcare reform side effects two weeks after germany ’ s sweeping health care reforms went into effect , cracks in the system are emerging .

yet , this medication is necessary to ease the side effects of combination therapy , which causes aches and pains , nausea , diarrhea and vomiting , jarchow said . " those who only receive welfare benefits or a small pension are frequently unable to cover the costs of medication , " jarchow said .
government action necessary deutsche aidshilfe called on the government to either lower the value added tax or add the costs of the over-the-counter drugs hiv / aids patients use to payment exemptions .
at the moment , the health-care regulations ensure that patients pay no more than 1 percent of their income for prescription drugs . aids patients , in particular , frequently live from low salaries or welfare benefits because their illness prevents them from holding down a regular job . deutsche aidshilfe also said that the reforms - which require people to proffer a € 10 -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- co-payment during each quarter that they visit a doctor - led some to avoid getting medical help even though they need it .
the organization estimated that someone being treated for hiv / aids who lives off the standard € 300 monthly welfare benefit has to pay € 30 just for over-the-counter drugs , as well as quarterly co-payments . prevention strategies tailored for the needs of young people will be a major issue at next week 's meeting between german anti-aids activists and the government in berlin .
another key issue will be the aids catastrophe unfolding right at germany ’ s doorsteps in eastern europe where the pandemic is spreading faster than anywhere else in the world .

speaking at a press conference , she said that as in previous years , overall aids-related statistics remained stable last year , with about 43 thousand aids patients , around 600 aids deaths and a rate of about 2000 new infections . yet in spite of the fact that these statistics haven ’ t changed much over the past two decades , schmidt also said the latest figures gave cause for concern . " there are worrying signs in the statistics indicating that prevention among young people below 30 years of age is diminishing , " she explained .
" the use of condoms in risky situations is dramatically lower than in previous years and there is a widening gap in the knowledge about aids . "
she also referred to a particular lack of understanding of aids among people from immigrant backgrounds . raising consciousness bernhard bieniek is spokesman of a national advisory panel , created at the outset of the aids pandemic in the 1980s , which coordinates national efforts at grass-roots and government levels .
he agrees with schmidt 's assessment . " young people especially have the impression that it 's not their problem anymore , " he told deutsche welle .
" very often they do n't know anybody who has hiv and they have never seen anyone who was sick and died of the disease .
so we have to find young people who are willing to get involved and find new ways to communicate . " he points out that in the past two decades , germany has been able to keep the spread of aids in check because the rate of new infections has remained largely stable and stresses that the country 's success in the fight against aids was primarily due to political courage and a strong anti-discriminatory approach . " we were lucky with the government we had in the 1980s – a conservative government – which had the courage to work with gay movements and find ways to make people at risk understand , " he says , adding that " in catholic countries such as spain and italy hiv infection is still increasing and that is partly due to the ignorance of politics .

" we have already voluntarily implemented the industry-wide reforms that separate research and investment banking , " said deutsche bank spokeswoman rohini pragasam in a statement to reuters . inappropriate working practices from mid-1999 through mid-2001 , deutsche bank " engaged in acts and practices that created or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts , thereby imposing conflicts of interest on research analysts that the firms failed to manage in an adequate or appropriate manner , " the sec regulators said in the statement . the statement went on to explain that deutsche bank " issued research reports that were not based on principles of fair dealing and good faith , and did not provide a sound basis for evaluating facts , contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims about the covered companies , and / or contained opinions for which there were no reasonable bases . " in addition , there were supervisory deficiencies at the bank , according to the regulators .
half of the fines and restitution being paid will go into a fund for their customers ; the other half will go to state securities regulators . bank agrees to walk straight and narrow deutsche bank neither admitted to nor denied the allegations .
it did , however , agree to refrain from future violations and to restrict distributions of hot new stocks to favored company executives and directors , a practice known as " spinning . " the delay of more than a year for the settlement with deutsche bank was caused by its failing to promptly turn over internal e-mails during the investigation , the regulators said , and the firm is paying $ 7.5 million for that alleged lapse as part of the settlement . the $ 87.5 million being paid by deutsche bank also includes a $ 25 million civil fine for alleged conflicts of interest , restitution of $ 25 million , $ 25 million to fund independent securities research and $ 5 million for investor education . wall street giants hit by revelations the probe which led to the investigation into deutsche bank securities , which also included a number of high profile wall street firms , was prompted in part by abuses revealed by new york attorney general eliot spitzer and resulted in a massive $ 1.4 billion settlement that involved investment banking giants , including goldman sachs and merrill lynch . u.s. bank thomas weisel partners also voluntarily agreed to pay damages for many of the same reasons as deutsche bank securities on friday .

" we have already voluntarily implemented the industry-wide reforms that separate research and investment banking , " said deutsche bank spokeswoman rohini pragasam in a statement to reuters . inappropriate working practices from mid-1999 through mid-2001 , deutsche bank " engaged in acts and practices that created or maintained inappropriate influence by investment banking over research analysts , thereby imposing conflicts of interest on research analysts that the firms failed to manage in an adequate or appropriate manner , " the sec regulators said in the statement . the statement went on to explain that deutsche bank " issued research reports that were not based on principles of fair dealing and good faith , and did not provide a sound basis for evaluating facts , contained exaggerated or unwarranted claims about the covered companies , and / or contained opinions for which there were no reasonable bases . " in addition , there were supervisory deficiencies at the bank , according to the regulators .
half of the fines and restitution being paid will go into a fund for their customers ; the other half will go to state securities regulators . bank agrees to walk straight and narrow deutsche bank neither admitted to nor denied the allegations .
it did , however , agree to refrain from future violations and to restrict distributions of hot new stocks to favored company executives and directors , a practice known as " spinning . " the delay of more than a year for the settlement with deutsche bank was caused by its failing to promptly turn over internal e-mails during the investigation , the regulators said , and the firm is paying $ 7.5 million for that alleged lapse as part of the settlement . the $ 87.5 million being paid by deutsche bank also includes a $ 25 million civil fine for alleged conflicts of interest , restitution of $ 25 million , $ 25 million to fund independent securities research and $ 5 million for investor education . wall street giants hit by revelations the probe which led to the investigation into deutsche bank securities , which also included a number of high profile wall street firms , was prompted in part by abuses revealed by new york attorney general eliot spitzer and resulted in a massive $ 1.4 billion settlement that involved investment banking giants , including goldman sachs and merrill lynch . u.s. bank thomas weisel partners also voluntarily agreed to pay damages for many of the same reasons as deutsche bank securities on friday .
thomas weisel will pay $ 12.5 million ; a $ 5 million fine for alleged conflicts of interest , $ 5 million in restitution and $ 2.5 million for independent research . compiled from wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank fined by u.s. sec deutsche bank has been fined by the u.s. securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- over the merger of american computer firms hewlett-packard and compaq in 2002 .

they ’ re using the account information to rob people of their money . ” “ people have lost money but not to the same extent as in the united states .
as is often the case , these kinds of developments slowly make their way over the atlantic and it ’ s not the banks that are taking the hit but the people themselves , ” schürmann said . in the united states alone , it is estimated that internet fraud was a $ 1 billion plus industry last year . and a lot of the damages hitting germany stem from fraud originating in the us .
in june this year , 1,422 separate phishing attacks were recorded , mostly focused on the united states .
this figure showed a huge increase from the 176 cases reported in january , according to the anti-phishing working group , a financial services industry task force based in the us . but schürmann thinks that there are ways to fight back : “ it ’ s easier to fight crime in the digital world than in the analogue world , " he said .
" fraudulent web sites usually exist online for no longer than around 50 hours before they disappear for ever , but we nevertheless have a decent chance of tracking down where the web sites originated . ” simple advice in the end , schürmann says that the best way to fight internet fraud is simply to ignore and erase any suspicious e mails : “ as a rule of thumb , people shouldn ’ t click onto links they ’ re unsure of . we recommend that people do their telebanking by logging on to the web sites of the banks directly . ” and if that doesn ’ t work , there ’ s also another way preventing web criminals from making unauthorized withdrawals . and that ’ s by banking in person .
it may not be as sexy as operating a high-speed modem , but it may be a little safer in the end .

authorities issued an arrest warrant against the 65-year-old for " acting as an accessory to attempted treason " , as well as " aiding the attempted development of atomic weapons " , the office said in a statement .
the judge released the man , identified as gerhard w. , on bail on thursday .
w. , who lives in south africa , and a suspected accomplice named gotthard l. , residing in switzerland , are believed to have played a role in an international ring that tried to procure materials for making nuclear weapons in 2001 .
supplying equipment for uranium enrichment prosecutors say w. worked as a mediator in obtaining an order for a south african company to make and supply aluminum tubing to be used in a uranium enrichment plant , the statement said .
he was paid € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- for his services , the office added .
nuclear technology underlies particular secrecy provisions and is classified as a state secret . " according to our current level of knowledge , the tubing was never delivered to libya , " it said .
swiss authorities have searched the home of his alleged accomplice , the 61-year-old l. , and seized documents and bank statements .
" to what extent l. was involved in the international procurement network is still being investigated , " the prosecutor ’ s office said .
libya chooses disarmament in the early 1980s , libya began a program to develop uranium enrichment plants using so-called gas centrifuge technology .
in 1997 , the government decided to import centrifuges and related equipment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of pakistan 's nuclear program , abdul qadeer khan , has admitted he transferred nuclear technology to libya , iran and north korea .
officials thus made contact with an international illegal procurement network , which mainly did business from dubai in distributing gas centrifuge technology .
abdul qadeer khan -lrb- photo -rrb- , the " father " of pakistan ’ s nuclear bomb , initiated this network in the 1980s .
libya announced late last year that it was abandoning attempts to develop nuclear , biological and chemical weapons and revealed its weapons program to the international atomic energy agency .
officials have thus had access to valuable information , particularly about foreign suppliers . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libyan leader pitches tent in brussels moammar gadhafi made his first visit to europe in 15 years .

it claims that leisure facilities , play schemes and sports activities often exclude disabled children due to health and safety fears .
lack of funding and poor access at some sites adds to pressure on families with disabled children .
the charity is calling for more training for leisure sector staff .
barnado 's carried out a survey of facilities across the uk and interviewed parents of disabled children for its report , postcards from home . "
they may have severe needs but the need of enjoyment during the summer is the same as other children . "
usha sarangi , parent the report claims that families with disabled children faced being cut off from the support of school and community-based services during the summer months .
it said : " many also have other children whose needs must be met .
" the parents interviewed all reported having less money in the summer holidays through having to take unpaid leave from work and paying for specialist play schemes .
" few were expecting to have a holiday away from home , both for financial reasons and because of the difficulty of finding accessible accommodation . "
the report claims families with disabled children also encounter " unhelpful attitudes " from some leisure sector workers as well as other people using leisure venues .
it said : " families regularly encounter negative and unhelpful attitudes from leisure services staff and the general public .
' more specialised staff ' usha sarangi , whose son rakesh has cerebral palsy , runs a play scheme for children with disabilities in cardiff for two weeks during the summer .
she says they are often an " invisible population " .
" they go to special schools all through the year , where they get so much stimulation , " she said .
" then you 're expecting them to sit at home for six weeks and be entertained by parents .
what do you do for entertainment ?
where to you take them ?
there are n't many places to go . "
mrs sarangi added : " every year , we see summer play schemes and people saying how good they are .
some parents are quite angry that our children ca n't access these .
" our children are equally able to enjoy a scheme in their own way .
they may have severe needs but the need of enjoyment during the summer is the same as other children . "
graham finlay , access officer for disability wales , said that grid gates at some playgrounds , designed to keep out dogs , also kept out wheelchairs .

the power , last used in 1806 , could in theory see mr blair charged with improper conduct in office but in practice has little chance of success .
us president bill clinton famously was impeached over the monica lewinsky scandal but was acquitted .
plaid cymru mp adam price is behind the blair impeachment call .
lords trial thursday 's report has been produced by dr glen rangwala , of trinity college , cambridge , and dan plesch , honorary fellow of birkbeck college , university of london .
it has reportedly been backed by 11 mps - nine of them welsh and scottish nationalists and two conservatives , frontbencher boris johnson and ex-shadow minister nigel evans .
price 's idea has been branded a laughable stunt by mps the mps are set to table a commons motion calling for mr blair to go before parliament to defend his record on iraq .
the idea would be to get mps to vote to set up a criminal trial of the prime minister , with the lords acting as judges .
one of the last impeachment cases was of warren hastings , the final governor-general of india , who was acquitted by his trial .
the power can theoretically be used for " high crimes and misdemeanours beyond the reach of the law or which no other authority of the state will prosecute " .
mr price is charging mr blair with : misleading parliament and the country over iraq negligence and incompetence over weapons of mass destruction undermining the constitution entering into a secret agreement with the us president .
' no joke ' anti-war mp mr price told bbc 2 's newsnight his impeachment call was not just a stunt .
" it deserves to be taken seriously , " he said .
" what has happened over the last 18 months is there is strong , compelling evidence we were misled over the war . "
on bbc wales , he added : " if nothing else comes out of this , people will realise impeachment is still an active part of parliamentary law and a minister who misleads and refuses to resign , can be removed by parliament through impeachment . "
the prime minister has acknowledged there were intelligence errors in the run-up to the iraq war but denies misleading people .
he stresses the butler and hutton inquiries cleared him of deception or improper dealings .
' silly ' labour mp and former minister keith vaz told newsnight : " this is a silly story for the end of the silly season . "
mr vaz said the evidence in the academics report was thin and questions over the iraq war had been raised numerous times in parliament , as well as in a string of inquiries .
" this matter has been put before the nation day after day over the last few years , " said mr vaz .
" all these reports have exonerated the government and it 's time to move on . "
donald anderson , chairman of the commons foreign affairs committee , called the impeachment call a " political stunt " and a " no-hoper in legal terms " .
" any judge would smell the politics of this and throw it out at the first opportunity , " he told bbc wales . "
obsolete ?
impeachment has mostly been used in britain during the 1640s civil war .
a special parliamentary committee in 1999 said " the circumstances in which impeachment has taken place are now so remote from the present that the procedure may be considered obsolete " .
lord norton of louth , professor of government at hull university , told bbc news online : " it is still on the books so it 's open technically for the commons to vote for impeachment . "
but in reality , it was more a way of raising an issue , with mps unlikely to vote for the measure , he said .

any talk of improving the event usually centres around two things - a change in route and economics .
in 2003 , carnival suffered the disappointment of a reduced attendance compared to previous years .
as a result it lost its status as europe 's biggest street party to the zurich street parade .
attendance figures 2003:600,000 2002:1.4m 2001:1.25m 2000:1.5m 1999:1.4m 1998:1.15m 1997:1.3m 1996:1m that came as a blow to the organisers who were hoping to cash in on the notting hill carnival brand .
london notting hill carnival ltd -lrb- lnhcl -rrb- board member debi gardner said the key is to find a balance between making a profit and keeping to the spirit of carnival .
" the board , in consultation with the executive committee of carnival arts , will look at any proposal that has significant benefits for carnival , but is dedicated to ensuring that notting hill carnival does not lose its identity , " she said .
" our intention is not to seek headline sponsorship that would lead to commercialisation of the event .
" we encourage businesses to look at sponsorship positively as an opportunity for companies to associate themselves with an extremely strong , high profile brand of 40 years standing .
increased earning power " lnhcl 's long-term aim is to attract the level of sponsorship for notting hill carnival that is commensurate with the income that it generates and which is in line with the level of sponsorship for other national events , without compromising its integrity . "
according to a report by the london development agency -lrb- lda -rrb- , carnival creates £ 93m for london .
figures from the lda show that the event supports 3,000 full-time jobs and the 1.16m people who attended last year spent £ 45m - an average of nearly £ 39 per person .
but the report says more can be done to increase the events earning power .
the lda is to start looking at pursuing an international publicity campaign and fundraising strategy to get money from the public and private sectors in the uk and abroad .
every year there is not a fatality is a year we have been lucky london mayor ken livingstone the then chief executive michael ward said : " carnival brings visitors and businesses to london .
" of those arriving at carnival last year , up to 316,000 had travelled from outside london but within the uk , and 90,000 came from abroad . "
many feel that the best way of maximising the benefits of carnival would be to change the route .
the narrow streets of notting hill provide a cramp - and according to london 's mayor - a dangerous environment for the million or so revellers .
earlier this year ken livingstone 's carnival strategic review group warned increasing numbers and safety concerns mean somebody could die .
it wants the course for 2005 re-routed through bayswater road and harrow road and ending in hyde park .
large crowds and narrow streets can lead to congested conditions " every year there is not a fatality is a year we have been lucky , " mr livingstone said .
" we can not honestly say to people who come to carnival that they are as safe as they could be . "
the report states : " without a fundamental change to increase public safety and reduce crowd density , a major incident at carnival could lead to significant loss of life . "
but ms gardener said : " the route will always incorporate and retain its links with notting hill , the spiritual home of carnival , the issue is whether and how far it should be extended .
" the board of lnhcl 's primary concern is safety .
post carnival 2004 , lnhcl will be consulting with these stakeholders on the issue of the carnival route .
' hugely unsafe ' " the objective will be to propose a route that is both capable of accommodating the number of people who attend the event , meeting public safety concerns and creating new opportunities for the development of the event . "
the route change is the most contentious issue .
alan bradley , of westminster council , said : " we would be totally opposed to the procession finishing in hyde park .
" we would have huge safety reservations about the use of the park after dusk .
the idea of having people in an unlit park would be hugely unsafe . "
if the boroughs of kensington and chelsea and westminster do not agree to alter the route , mr livingstone said he would call on the metropolitan police commissioner to use his powers to change it .
a spokesman for the met said : " we have not been approached about the proposed route change but every aspect of carnival is always under review . "

lukoil pumps 19 % of russia 's output of crude oil and holds the same amount of russia 's reserves .
it is also a significant global player , with 2 % of worldwide production and 1.5 % of reserves .
there are two bidders so far , us driller conocophillips and a new york investment firm , officials said .
the auction is expected to attract more interest , as buying into russia 's vast oil reserves offers one of the few quick ways for global oil firms to increase their reserves , though the legal quagmire currently sucking down yukos may dampen enthusiasm .
yukos is being chased by russian authorities for multi-million dollar tax arrears .
lining up conocophillips is widely seen as the front runner for lukoil .
its chief executive , james mulva , flew to russia for talks with president vladimir putin and lukoil boss vagit alekperov last month . "
the sale will go a long way to balance out a lot of bad yukos vibes " paul collision , brunswick ubs analyst name here conocophillips has been talking to lukoil about investment possibilities since september 2003 .
" so far we have talked to only two candidates , " said kirill tomashchuk , who heads russia 's federal property fund , and is co-ordinating the stake sale .
he confirmed that conocophillips is in the running , said the other potential buyer was dabir investments , run by david guggenheim , and added that he is expecting more bidders to come forward .
rare chance russia and the middle east are the " only two places in the world where big oil can spend big money to find big production and reserves , " said gene gillespie , an oil analyst at new york firm howard gillespie .
with instability in the middle east , " the former soviet union is one , if not the only , game in town for the large companies to be able to do something that 'll move the needle , " he said .
the auction , due on 29 september , will bring a major windfall for the russian government .
the sell-off will be closely watched by foreign investors for signals about the kremlin 's stance towards the oil industry , which is reeling from the tax fraud trials embroiling yukos and its former boss , mikhail khodorkovsky .
" the sale will go a long way to balance out a lot of bad yukos vibes , " said paul collison , an analyst at brunswick ubs in moscow .

but the pioneering study , which spans 35 years , identified an increase in the diagnosis of both eczema and hay fever .
more than 3,500 children were involved in the survey , which was first carried out by aberdeen university in 1964 .
it found that the diagnosis of asthma in children with a wheeze rose from 28 % then to 64 % in 1994 - but increased by just 3 % over the following five years .
the survey was carried out at the same schools which took part in the 1964 study .
the proportion of children with symptoms in whom asthma has been diagnosed is high , suggesting that the widespread publicity given to asthma has paid off aberdeen university study the study of the city 's pupils , which takes the form of a questionnaire to parents , was revived in 1989 and has been repeated every five years since then .
in the first survey , asthma had been diagnosed in 73 of the 261 youngsters with a wheeze .
by 1989 that figure had risen to 331 -lrb- 49 % -rrb- of the 675 children with a wheeze .
the figure climbed again in 1994 , when 654 -lrb- 64 % -rrb- of the 1,025 children with a wheeze had been diagnosed with the condition .
the results of the 1999 survey , which have been published in the british medical journal , showed that 67 % of youngsters had been diagnosed with asthma .
the researchers said : " in aberdeen , the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of asthma now seems to be stable .
chronic cough " the proportion of children with symptoms in whom asthma has been diagnosed is high , suggesting that the widespread publicity given to asthma has paid off .
" indeed , a higher rate of diagnosis might well be undesirable , leading to asthma drugs being given inappropriately - for instance , to children with chronic cough . "
when the study was first carried out the condition was diagnosed in twice as many boys as girls , but the gap has narrowed to a point where the two sexes are almost equal .
researchers at aberdeen university carried out the study however , the research did highlight a " small but significant " increase in the number of children with eczema or hay fever between 1994 and 1999 .
the figures rose from 18 % to 21 % and from 13 % to 15 % respectively .
in 1964 , the levels had been 5 % and 3.2 % , although both had risen to 12 % by 1989 .
" the continuing increases between 1994 and 1999 in diagnosed eczema and hay fever suggest that the tendency for children to develop allergies is still increasing , although these increases may also in part reflect changes in diagnostic fashion , " said the report .

but the pioneering study , which spans 35 years , identified an increase in the diagnosis of both eczema and hay fever .
more than 3,500 children were involved in the survey , which was first carried out by aberdeen university in 1964 .
it found that the diagnosis of asthma in children with a wheeze rose from 28 % then to 64 % in 1994 - but increased by just 3 % over the following five years .
the survey was carried out at the same schools which took part in the 1964 study .
the proportion of children with symptoms in whom asthma has been diagnosed is high , suggesting that the widespread publicity given to asthma has paid off aberdeen university study the study of the city 's pupils , which takes the form of a questionnaire to parents , was revived in 1989 and has been repeated every five years since then .
in the first survey , asthma had been diagnosed in 73 of the 261 youngsters with a wheeze .
by 1989 that figure had risen to 331 -lrb- 49 % -rrb- of the 675 children with a wheeze .
the figure climbed again in 1994 , when 654 -lrb- 64 % -rrb- of the 1,025 children with a wheeze had been diagnosed with the condition .
the results of the 1999 survey , which have been published in the british medical journal , showed that 67 % of youngsters had been diagnosed with asthma .
the researchers said : " in aberdeen , the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of asthma now seems to be stable .
chronic cough " the proportion of children with symptoms in whom asthma has been diagnosed is high , suggesting that the widespread publicity given to asthma has paid off .
" indeed , a higher rate of diagnosis might well be undesirable , leading to asthma drugs being given inappropriately - for instance , to children with chronic cough . "
when the study was first carried out the condition was diagnosed in twice as many boys as girls , but the gap has narrowed to a point where the two sexes are almost equal .
researchers at aberdeen university carried out the study however , the research did highlight a " small but significant " increase in the number of children with eczema or hay fever between 1994 and 1999 .
the figures rose from 18 % to 21 % and from 13 % to 15 % respectively .
in 1964 , the levels had been 5 % and 3.2 % , although both had risen to 12 % by 1989 .
" the continuing increases between 1994 and 1999 in diagnosed eczema and hay fever suggest that the tendency for children to develop allergies is still increasing , although these increases may also in part reflect changes in diagnostic fashion , " said the report .

plans were agreed for hundreds of new homes and a supermarket , despite a petition signed by 13,000 people .
there were noisy protests from local residents outside the civic centre when they were told there was not enough room for them to attend the meeting .
the decision shocked local butcher ray richardson , who will now receive a compulsory purchase order .
what we have got to do now is engage everybody , including those who have reservations about the scheme , to make sure we get it right jeremy kite , deputy leader , dartford borough council he said : " even the report compiled by the officers ran the whole scheme down - yet they still passed it " .
objectors to the road had staged a number of marches , including a huge rally in central park in june , saying the road was unnecessary and would ruin the park .
but the council had insisted the town needed the road in order for the massive regeneration plans to proceed .
the road is also set to go through an ex-servicemen 's club .
in a meeting that lasted more than five hours , councillors on the development control board approved the planning application by 10 votes to six , subject to conditions .
the council 's deputy leader , jeremy kite , said the outcome had followed a very " robust debate " .
