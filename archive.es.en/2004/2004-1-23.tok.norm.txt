uist hedgehog rescue -lrb- uhr -rrb- met in birmingham on friday to see how it can fight a second scottish natural heritage-led cull on the island .
uhr is hoping to persuade celebrities such as sting and joanna lumley to go to north uist and help stop the cull .
the scheme was deemed necessary because hedgehogs eat the eggs of important local ground-nesting birds .
snh killed just 66 hedgehogs there last year at a cost of £ 100,000 , or about £ 1,500 per animal .
despite the seemingly poor numbers , snh believes it killed 70 % of the hedgehogs in its first target area in 2003 .
death sentence the hedgehogs were killed by lethal injection after first receiving a knock-out gas .
last month snh agreed to spend £ 186,475 per year to help rid uist of hedgehogs , with the cull set to be extended to the adjoining island of benbecula during the latest drive .
some 5,000 hedgehogs are thought to be at risk .
protesters , such as uhr , have strongly attacked the cull as " inhumane " and a waste of taxpayers ' money with more than 3,000 letters of objection received by snh this year .
last year uhr , a consortium of animal protection , rehabilitation and rescue organisations , handed out £ 5 to islanders for each rescued hedgehog .
they saved and relocated 156 hedgehogs during their summer-long campaign .

uist hedgehog rescue -lrb- uhr -rrb- met in birmingham on friday to see how it can fight a second scottish natural heritage-led cull on the island .
uhr is hoping to persuade celebrities such as sting and joanna lumley to go to north uist and help stop the cull .
the scheme was deemed necessary because hedgehogs eat the eggs of important local ground-nesting birds .
snh killed just 66 hedgehogs there last year at a cost of £ 100,000 , or about £ 1,500 per animal .
despite the seemingly poor numbers , snh believes it killed 70 % of the hedgehogs in its first target area in 2003 .
death sentence the hedgehogs were killed by lethal injection after first receiving a knock-out gas .
last month snh agreed to spend £ 186,475 per year to help rid uist of hedgehogs , with the cull set to be extended to the adjoining island of benbecula during the latest drive .
some 5,000 hedgehogs are thought to be at risk .
protesters , such as uhr , have strongly attacked the cull as " inhumane " and a waste of taxpayers ' money with more than 3,000 letters of objection received by snh this year .
last year uhr , a consortium of animal protection , rehabilitation and rescue organisations , handed out £ 5 to islanders for each rescued hedgehog .
they saved and relocated 156 hedgehogs during their summer-long campaign .
star backing celebrities including sting , sir paul mccartney , twiggy , joanna lumley , sir tim rice and watership down author richard adams all offered the animals homes over the summer and uhr is hoping they will do the same this year .
the british hedgehog preservation society -lrb- bhps -rrb- , which is also involved in this year 's rescue plans , still has £ 40,000 of the £ 70,000 raised to help save the hedgehogs from last year .
but it says a new appeal - first among its members - may be necessary to mount the new rescue mission .
fay vaas , bhps chief executive , said : " i hope we will mount a rescue campaign .
" it is very unlikely we will not be there but we do n't have enough money and there may be another appeal . "

children 's commissioner peter clarke decided to refer the matter as a possible contempt of court .
the bridgend council leader had criticised the conduct of the clywch inquiry , set up to look into into allegations of child abuse by the former drama teacher john owen .
mr owen committed suicide two years ago shortly before he was to stand trial over allegations by former pupils of ysgol gyfun rhydfelen , pontypridd .
mr jones said the inquiry which was launched into the matter was a " witch-hunt " and a " farce " on thursday , at a special hearing , mr clarke decided to report mr jones for possible contempt of court .
the inquiry had been examining allegations of abuse by teacher john owen , who committed suicide two years ago shortly before he was to stand trial over allegations by former pupils of ysgol gyfun rhydfelen , pontypridd .
mr jones had attacked the conduct of the inquiry and accused parents of the alleged victims of putting the welsh language before the welfare of their children .
he wrote to mr clarke and to first minister rhodri morgan , expressing his serious misgivings about the way the clywch inquiry was being run .
it was later suggested that this was an attempt to unduly influence mr clarke .
mr clarke ruled that letters mr jones sent him and first minister rhodri morgan should be referred to the attorney general lord goldsmith .
penalties for such an offence include an unlimited fine or two years in jail .
john owen killed himself before a sex abuse trial could begin mr jones , who had apologised after sending the letters , did not attend the hearing but was represented by his lawyer .
he said he was disappointed and will now seek further legal advice .
the councillor announced he was to step down from local government earlier this month and he is also relinquishing the chairmanship of the examination board the welsh joint education committee -lrb- wjec -rrb- later this year .
parents of mr owen 's alleged victims had previously told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme they were disgusted by mr jones ' attack on them .
they said they might still sue him for libel - despite having been given an apology .
" as far as we were concerned , the inquiry was over , so we were flabbergasted when we had this news , " said one parent .
" when we saw the content of the letter , we were absolutely disgusted . "
mr jones admitted to bbc wales last week that he sometimes used " intemperate language " , but denied he was guilty of contempt over his written comments .
the children 's commissioner 's office now says the report into the clywch inquiry , which ended in november , will not be ready until at least april .

the announcement comes four months after affleck , 31 , and 34-year-old lopez called off their marriage amid a worldwide media frenzy .
lopez 's new york-based publicist , rob shuter , said : " i am confirming the reports that jennifer lopez has ended her engagement to ben affleck . "
their two-year relationship had become the world 's biggest celebrity romance .
mr shuter added : " at this difficult time , we ask that you respect her privacy . "
affleck 's publicist , ken sunshine , declined to comment on the break-up .
" as always , we never ever comment on the personal lives of our clients , " he said .
the couple blamed media attention for their wedding cancellation apparently much in love , the couple were dubbed " bennifer " by the media , which scrutinised their every move .
they were feted like no other hollywood couple since elizabeth taylor and richard burton in the 1960s .
they had planned to marry at an exclusive resort near santa barbara , california , on 14 september , but cancelled the wedding just days beforehand blaming voracious media attention .
some reports suggested that lopez had moved to end the relationship after affleck was spotted in a canadian strip club last summer .
rumours but after a week of separation they met up again at affleck 's $ 7m -lrb- £ 3.8m -rrb- estate near savannah , georgia , pursued by the paparazzi .
they had frequently been seen there since , but more rumours about their relationship surfaced after affleck travelled to europe alone to promote his latest film paycheck .
he also appeared alone at the sundance film festival in utah in the us .

why has this myth persisted for so long ?
raya beilis still remembers the day in 1911 that her father was arrested by the kiev secret police , and put on trial for the alleged jewish ritual murder of a christian boy .
" i was too young to understand , " says raya , who now lives in a nursing home in new york city .
" all i knew was that they said if he 's guilty , they 're going to kill every one of you . "
the authorities in kiev said mendel beilis had lured a teenager called andrey yustschinsky away from his family , killed him and drained his blood for the production of matzah , the unleavened bread eaten at passover .
mendel beilis was acquitted in 1913 the court threw out the charges , which were clearly fabricated .
mendel beilis was freed and the feared pogrom against the kiev jews never happened .
but where did this bizarre accusation come from ?
the origins of this anti-semitic myth , known as the blood libel , lie in medieval england .
in 1144 a skinner 's apprentice called william went missing in norwich .
when his body was found , the monks who examined the corpse claimed that the boy 's head had been pierced by a crown of thorns .
some years later , a monk called thomas began to gather evidence about william 's death .
his main aim was to establish the boy as a holy martyr and draw pilgrims to the cathedral .
almost as an incidental matter , he accused the jews of norwich of killing the boy .
" the unforeseen outcome of what thomas did was to create the blood libel , which then itself takes on a life of its own , " says dr victor morgan , of the university of east anglia .
hysteria , not evidence the accusation that jews would drain the blood of children and then use it for ritual purposes is bizarre , as judaism has a powerful taboo against blood .
indeed , kosher butchering is meant to remove all blood from meat .
but the idea seems to have had a powerful hold on the mediaeval imagination .
the myth originated in east anglia " it 's not just an act of murder and of a ritual murder , " says professor robert wistrich , of the university of jerusalem .
" removing the blood from the body and then using it for a ritual or religious purpose - there is something horrific , but yet as fascinating as it is repulsive in this notion . "
the blood libel spread across england and continental europe over the centuries , with hundreds of accusations , all based on hysteria rather than evidence .
there were notorious blood libel cases in lincoln in 1255 and trento , italy , in 1475 .
many jews were executed .
others were killed by mobs seeking revenge .
there was another rash of accusations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in eastern europe - societies gripped by economic transformation and political uncertainty , climaxing with the beilis case of 1913 .
the evil myth that just wo n't die even though the blood libel has been disproved countless times , it refuses to fade away .
racist groups in the us still sell videos which maintain that jews commit ritual murder .
and the charge has now gained currency in the arab world .
the syrian defence minister , mustafa tlass , has written a book repeating the accusation , while some journalists continue to use it as part of the rhetorical war against israel .
professor john klier , of university college london , says this is a tactic that has backfired .
the blood libel is now so discredited in the west , he says , that the people who use it are seen as outside the scope of rational political debate .
the blood libel was broadcast on bbc radio 4 in the uk at 2000 gmt on monday 26 january .

the changes involve one-member-one-vote selection of the snp 's leader and parliamentary candidates .
john swinney promised reform after he crushed a challenge to his leadership in the autumn and said it was time to change the party 's " cumbersome " system .
under his proposals , the snp 's main goal would also be switched from " self-government " to full independence .
mr swinney wants to rewrite the entire constitution , meaning the leader and deputy leader would be elected by the membership as a whole , not the party conference .
instead of a single branch nomination , challengers would need support from 100 members across 20 branches .
i think the snp has to reach out to a wider proportion of our membership snp leader john swinney the leader would appoint a new business convener to chair the party 's executive and run its headquarters .
candidates would also be chosen by the broad membership , rather than branch hustings , with a stated aim for gender balance among candidates .
underpinning snp policy would be the aim of full scottish independence instead of " self government " , which some have regarded as ambiguous .
speaking on bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , mr swinney said it was time to change the snp 's constitution after 40 years .
he said party members had been consulted on the proposed changes over the past few months and would have the opportunity to vote on them at a party conference in april .
' policy and direction ' the snp leader said he was confident the proposals would receive widespread support and represented the way in which members wanted the party to progress .
mr swinney said nationalists would be able to concentrate on the campaign for independence rather than the " cumbersome , internal business that often preoccupies us " .
" i think the snp has to reach out to a wider proportion of our membership and involve them directly in the business of the party , " he said .
alex neil -lrb- left -rrb- said recruiting more women could be difficult " it 's happening in the election of the leader and deputy leader and also in the ranking and selection of parliamentary candidates at all levels .
" setting the policy and the direction of the party will continue to be resolved by our conference and our national council to make sure our activists are fully involved in deciding the direction of the party . "
mr swinney said he wanted snp members to tell him if they would be happy with " a mechanism " to ensure gender balance .
" it 's an issue i think we have to confront as a party and we need to have consensus , " he said .
the problem within the party has not been an unwillingness to elect women but that we do n't have enough women members alex neil , snp msp " i think it 's time we had such a mechanism to ensure our parliamentary group is representative . "
alex neil , snp msp for central scotland , said while moving to one-member-one-vote was " inevitable " , any attempt to encourage more women into politics would prove more difficult .
he said : " we all share the aspiration of getting many more women into the parliamentary party .
" the problem within the party has not been an unwillingness to elect women but that we do n't have enough women members .
" quite frankly , constitutions do n't solve that problem . "
mr neil said he believed women in scottish society , generally , gave priority to family rather than politics .
' desperate move ' " the party has to do something to increase the number of women members and the number of women who are prepared to be activists , " he said .
meanwhile , labour claimed the changes were designed to make it harder for the party to drop mr swinney as leader .
scotland office minister anne mcguire said : " the truth behind this constitution is that john swinney fears he ca n't remain leader for much longer and is desperately trying to hang onto his job .
" last week we saw him urging people to break the law and this week we see him trying to rewrite the rules to make it harder to sack him . "
