to stem the costs of coffins , cremations and burials , berliners are discovering discount funeral parlors . traditionally in germany the deceased is laid out in a coffin .
family and friends meet at a chapel for a funeral service , after which the casket is carried to a grave and buried .
days later a gravestone is set at the head of the plot , telling the name and birth and death dates of the deceased . the average german funeral costs € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- , about double the average monthly income .
and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business . " when you bury a social welfare recipient or all the relatives are social welfare recipients , they all have to assume equal parts for the funeral and file the appropriate applications to the social welfare office , " funeral home director fritz told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 spain allegedly misled germany over bombings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did aznar -lrb- left -rrb- deceive european allies after the bombings ?
spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "

" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

"
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .

poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced .

their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

"
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists .

poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2004 german funeral discounter buries dead abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being laid to rest is n't cheap death in germany is expensive and many people have trouble paying it , especially during tough economic times .
to stem the costs of coffins , cremations and burials , berliners are discovering discount funeral parlors . traditionally in germany the deceased is laid out in a coffin .
family and friends meet at a chapel for a funeral service , after which the casket is carried to a grave and buried .
days later a gravestone is set at the head of the plot , telling the name and birth and death dates of the deceased . the average german funeral costs € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- , about double the average monthly income .
and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business . " when you bury a social welfare recipient or all the relatives are social welfare recipients , they all have to assume equal parts for the funeral and file the appropriate applications to the social welfare office , " funeral home director fritz told deutsche welle .
bargain coffins but there is an alternative .
germans can go to one of hartmut woite 's " berolina coffin discount " funeral parlors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i buy the coffins by the truck-load , " woite explained .
" they come with a truck direct from the factory and bring me 250 coffins .
that means i have a totally different price , and i can pass the savings on to my customers .
cremation costs € 250 . the wood 's not great and there 's no paint , no varnish , nothing . " but the casket and the undertaker just make up part of the costs .
families also have to pay for either a cemetery plot or for cremation .
here , too , woite has found a way to avoid the high price germany 's cities and towns charge for such services .
he sends corpses for cremation to the neighboring czech republic , where costs are significantly lower .
or customers can have their deceased buried in a czech cemetery .
corpse tourism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three times a week woite 's employees drive back and forth between germany and the czech republic .
and although german law requires corpses and ashes to be kept in graveyards , woite takes advantage of a loophole in the law so his customers can take their loved ones home in an urn . " earth mixed with ashes , there 's no law about that in germany , " woite explained .
" we bury over there and bring back the earth mixed with ashes , and that 's what i hand over to the people . " woite has been heavily criticized by competitors for his czech business .
they say he 's irreverent , and they call the journeys to the czech republic " corpse tourism . "
but that has n't stopped the undertaker .
he 's planning an organized bus trip to the czech republic in april so customers can see for themselves where they or their loved ones may one day be cremated . silke ballweg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2004 german funeral discounter buries dead abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being laid to rest is n't cheap death in germany is expensive and many people have trouble paying it , especially during tough economic times .
to stem the costs of coffins , cremations and burials , berliners are discovering discount funeral parlors . traditionally in germany the deceased is laid out in a coffin .
family and friends meet at a chapel for a funeral service , after which the casket is carried to a grave and buried .
days later a gravestone is set at the head of the plot , telling the name and birth and death dates of the deceased . the average german funeral costs € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- , about double the average monthly income .
and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business . " when you bury a social welfare recipient or all the relatives are social welfare recipients , they all have to assume equal parts for the funeral and file the appropriate applications to the social welfare office , " funeral home director fritz told deutsche welle .
bargain coffins but there is an alternative .
germans can go to one of hartmut woite 's " berolina coffin discount " funeral parlors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i buy the coffins by the truck-load , " woite explained .
" they come with a truck direct from the factory and bring me 250 coffins .
that means i have a totally different price , and i can pass the savings on to my customers .
cremation costs € 250 . the wood 's not great and there 's no paint , no varnish , nothing . " but the casket and the undertaker just make up part of the costs .
families also have to pay for either a cemetery plot or for cremation .
here , too , woite has found a way to avoid the high price germany 's cities and towns charge for such services .
he sends corpses for cremation to the neighboring czech republic , where costs are significantly lower .
or customers can have their deceased buried in a czech cemetery .
corpse tourism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three times a week woite 's employees drive back and forth between germany and the czech republic .
and although german law requires corpses and ashes to be kept in graveyards , woite takes advantage of a loophole in the law so his customers can take their loved ones home in an urn . " earth mixed with ashes , there 's no law about that in germany , " woite explained .
" we bury over there and bring back the earth mixed with ashes , and that 's what i hand over to the people . " woite has been heavily criticized by competitors for his czech business .
they say he 's irreverent , and they call the journeys to the czech republic " corpse tourism . "
but that has n't stopped the undertaker .
he 's planning an organized bus trip to the czech republic in april so customers can see for themselves where they or their loved ones may one day be cremated . silke ballweg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 spain allegedly misled germany over bombings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did aznar -lrb- left -rrb- deceive european allies after the bombings ?
spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

"
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists .

poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .

to stem the costs of coffins , cremations and burials , berliners are discovering discount funeral parlors . traditionally in germany the deceased is laid out in a coffin .
family and friends meet at a chapel for a funeral service , after which the casket is carried to a grave and buried .
days later a gravestone is set at the head of the plot , telling the name and birth and death dates of the deceased . the average german funeral costs € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- , about double the average monthly income .
and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business . " when you bury a social welfare recipient or all the relatives are social welfare recipients , they all have to assume equal parts for the funeral and file the appropriate applications to the social welfare office , " funeral home director fritz told deutsche welle .
bargain coffins but there is an alternative .
germans can go to one of hartmut woite 's " berolina coffin discount " funeral parlors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i buy the coffins by the truck-load , " woite explained .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .

german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 german press review : brave new digital world german papers on wednesday commented on the opening of the computer trade fair cebit and a german supreme court decision to strike down a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs . on the day of the opening of the annual german computer trade fair cebit , german editorials reflected on the state of affairs in the computer industry .
the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .
otherwise the west will be taken hostage by terrorism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .
otherwise the west will be taken hostage by terrorism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.03.2004 " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is under fire for being too graphic .
the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.03.2004 " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is under fire for being too graphic .
the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 german press review : brave new digital world german papers on wednesday commented on the opening of the computer trade fair cebit and a german supreme court decision to strike down a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs . on the day of the opening of the annual german computer trade fair cebit , german editorials reflected on the state of affairs in the computer industry .
the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .

to stem the costs of coffins , cremations and burials , berliners are discovering discount funeral parlors . traditionally in germany the deceased is laid out in a coffin .
family and friends meet at a chapel for a funeral service , after which the casket is carried to a grave and buried .
days later a gravestone is set at the head of the plot , telling the name and birth and death dates of the deceased . the average german funeral costs € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- , about double the average monthly income .
and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business . " when you bury a social welfare recipient or all the relatives are social welfare recipients , they all have to assume equal parts for the funeral and file the appropriate applications to the social welfare office , " funeral home director fritz told deutsche welle .
bargain coffins but there is an alternative .
germans can go to one of hartmut woite 's " berolina coffin discount " funeral parlors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i buy the coffins by the truck-load , " woite explained .
" they come with a truck direct from the factory and bring me 250 coffins .
that means i have a totally different price , and i can pass the savings on to my customers .
cremation costs € 250 . the wood 's not great and there 's no paint , no varnish , nothing . " but the casket and the undertaker just make up part of the costs .
families also have to pay for either a cemetery plot or for cremation .
here , too , woite has found a way to avoid the high price germany 's cities and towns charge for such services .
he sends corpses for cremation to the neighboring czech republic , where costs are significantly lower .
or customers can have their deceased buried in a czech cemetery .
corpse tourism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three times a week woite 's employees drive back and forth between germany and the czech republic .
and although german law requires corpses and ashes to be kept in graveyards , woite takes advantage of a loophole in the law so his customers can take their loved ones home in an urn . " earth mixed with ashes , there 's no law about that in germany , " woite explained .
" we bury over there and bring back the earth mixed with ashes , and that 's what i hand over to the people . " woite has been heavily criticized by competitors for his czech business .
they say he 's irreverent , and they call the journeys to the czech republic " corpse tourism . "
but that has n't stopped the undertaker .
he 's planning an organized bus trip to the czech republic in april so customers can see for themselves where they or their loved ones may one day be cremated . silke ballweg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .
since the madrid bombings , france has boosted the number of soldiers at airports , train stations and other sites considered sensitive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for urgent european summit on terror germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .
since the madrid bombings , france has boosted the number of soldiers at airports , train stations and other sites considered sensitive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for urgent european summit on terror germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .

the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .
otherwise the west will be taken hostage by terrorism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .

but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .
otherwise the west will be taken hostage by terrorism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .
since the madrid bombings , france has boosted the number of soldiers at airports , train stations and other sites considered sensitive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for urgent european summit on terror germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .
since the madrid bombings , france has boosted the number of soldiers at airports , train stations and other sites considered sensitive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for urgent european summit on terror germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists .

last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .

speaking at a special session of the parliament of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , rau said abuses of human rights in a country could no longer be viewed by the outside world as " domestic affairs " and that action must be taken at times .
but such action should only be conducted with broad support from the international community , he warned .
security today ca n't just be focused on the territory of one state , rau said .
with countries increasingly interlinked , there is no " believable alternative to policies of multilateralism , " he said , pointing to the recent iraq war and the earthquake catastrophe in iran as examples .
rau praised ecowas for its own multilateral success stories .
founded in 1975 , the bloc has now grown to include 15 countries and 220 million people .
like the european union , he said , ecowas has become much more than an economic block .
recently it has sent peacekeepers to stop regional conflicts in liberia and the ivory coast .
an indirect critique of islamic law without explicitly mentioning the fact that strict islamic law is practiced in northern nigeria , rau did indirectly criticize the practice of sharia law in his speech .
" freedom also means democratization and the guarantee of human rights , " and that requires decisive reforms of the justice system , he warned .
since 1999 , at least 12 states in nigeria have implemented sharia law , which has been the subject of international criticism because of its draconian penal measures - including the public stoning of women who engage in pre- or extra-marital sex .
germany 's president first arrived in africa on tuesday , when he was received by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo in his official residence in the capital of abuja .
rau is holding talks with political leaders in obasanjo 's government as well as the country 's senate and parliament as well as representatives of human rights organizations and churches .
he will spend one day in abuja and another in kano in the country 's northern quran belt .
between 50 and 60 million muslims live in nigeria , the largest concentration on the entire continent .
germany sees in nigeria an important partner for peacekeeping on the continent .
as one of the most powerful african countries , it can play a pivotal role in brokering peace in crisis regions .
" it 's one of the few countries in africa with a profile in peacekeeping , " stefen mair of the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" it also has the necessary capacities to do something and it has already -lrb- demonstrated -rrb- that in the past in liberia and sierra leone . "
visiting the troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's largest frigate , the bayern , at the port of djibouti .
after nigeria , rau will travel on friday to the former german colony of tanzania , home to the spectacular serengeti plain and kilimanjaro , africa 's highest mountain .
there he will meet with german navy sailors stationed as part of the " operation enduring freedom " deployment against international terrorism .
a total of 250 german soldiers are stationed at the horn of africa .
together , they are guarding the sea lanes in red sea and the gulf of aden from terrorism in concert with troops from the united states , france , italy , great britain and spain .
" tanzania has been one of germany 's longest and closest partners in development cooperation in africa , " mair explained .
" there 's a big affinity among tanzania 's elite for germany , and that 's been the case for 30 or 40 years .
it 's one of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- most reliable and comfortable partners . "
it 's also one of the poorest countries in africa , with very weak economic development .
nevertheless , it plays an extremely important role in the eastern africa region which has not been overlooked by berlin .
" it has a relatively low profile when it comes to foreign policy , but -lrb- tanzania -rrb- plays an important role in regional stability , " mair said .
" it 's main contribution is that the country has taken on a large number of refugees from rwanda and burundi at a high cost .
that 's much to tanzania 's credit . "
in all , rau will spend four days in tanzania , where he plans to meet with president benjamin william mkapa , visit the head of the international criminal tribunal for rwanda and the east african community secretariat and drop in on development projects in the country .
having foregone a bid for a second term as president , rau 's next trip will be to the pension office when the 73-year-old goes into retirement in just a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

barges that can carry 2,000 tons are now loading two-thirds that amount to reduce their draft and avoid running aground .
not enough rain fell in central europe this winter to replenish the river after it fell to its lowest in nearly 60 years last summer , following three months of heat waves and drought .
" we 've hardly seen any rain this winter , and with river levels already low going into winter , the situation has become more tense , " peter kulsen , a consultant at freight tracking firm pjk international bv told bloomberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 spain allegedly misled germany over bombings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did aznar -lrb- left -rrb- deceive european allies after the bombings ?
spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 german press review : brave new digital world german papers on wednesday commented on the opening of the computer trade fair cebit and a german supreme court decision to strike down a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs . on the day of the opening of the annual german computer trade fair cebit , german editorials reflected on the state of affairs in the computer industry .
the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .
otherwise the west will be taken hostage by terrorism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

his return is said to be prompted by changes made to existing laws by chancellor schröder 's government after the " florida rolf " case sparked outrage across the nation .
the new rules no longer treat the misuse of germany 's generous welfare system with benevolence and only allow germans living abroad to draw social benefits under special conditions , none of which apply to " florida rolf . "
the former bank manager had been justifying his lifestyle on the grounds of a certificate issued by a psychiatrist , attesting that rolf john was n't psychologically cut for a life in gloomy germany and was prone to commit suicide if he lived there .
but " florida rolf " is n't unduly worried about his financial future after the elimination of his monthly handouts of € 1,600 .
he told news magazine spiegel that he had hardly paid into germany 's pension coffers so far , but that " there 's a new basic pension rate since last year for people like me .
i believe that 's higher than the social welfare limit . " dw-world.de germans outraged over “ florida rolf ” case a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 german press review : brave new digital world german papers on wednesday commented on the opening of the computer trade fair cebit and a german supreme court decision to strike down a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs . on the day of the opening of the annual german computer trade fair cebit , german editorials reflected on the state of affairs in the computer industry .
the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .
it ’ s about time that europe and the u.s. find a common strategic answer to the challenge , concluded the paper .

the assessment - based on five economic tests - proved to be negative , with only one of the five tests passed .
but the government insisted that the uk was in principle in favor of the euro and promised to look again at the issue .
however , very few believe that enough has changed in the economic situation to enable britain to join the euro and brown is widely expected to confirm this tomorrow in his annual budget speech .
rumors are also circulating that brown will announce a rolling assessment on the euro - telling parliament every march whether enough has changed to re-assess the five tests .
but march 2005 will be just months before the next general election and the governing labour party are unlikely to want to turn the euro into an election issue for fearing of boosting the anti-euro conservative opposition .
this leaves the earliest possible decision to re-run the tests in march 2006 , paving the way for a possible referendum in march 2008 .
if the vote is positive , then the earliest the euro could be introduced in the uk is the beginning of 2011 , because the government has said that it will need 30 months to complete the changeover from pounds to euros .
therefore the uk is unlikely to join until after the first wave of accession countries .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .

german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .
since the madrid bombings , france has boosted the number of soldiers at airports , train stations and other sites considered sensitive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for urgent european summit on terror germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists .

therefore the uk is unlikely to join until after the first wave of accession countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc uk set to reject euro again the british government last june unveiled a detailed assessment of whether the uk was economically ready to join the single currency .
the assessment - based on five economic tests - proved to be negative , with only one of the five tests passed .
but the government insisted that the uk was in principle in favor of the euro and promised to look again at the issue .
however , very few believe that enough has changed in the economic situation to enable britain to join the euro and brown is widely expected to confirm this tomorrow in his annual budget speech .
rumors are also circulating that brown will announce a rolling assessment on the euro - telling parliament every march whether enough has changed to re-assess the five tests .
but march 2005 will be just months before the next general election and the governing labour party are unlikely to want to turn the euro into an election issue for fearing of boosting the anti-euro conservative opposition .
this leaves the earliest possible decision to re-run the tests in march 2006 , paving the way for a possible referendum in march 2008 .
if the vote is positive , then the earliest the euro could be introduced in the uk is the beginning of 2011 , because the government has said that it will need 30 months to complete the changeover from pounds to euros .
therefore the uk is unlikely to join until after the first wave of accession countries .

euro rules mean that budget deficits - which is the amount of money the government takes in tax minus the amount it spends - must be lower than 3 percent of gdp .
but the figures show that six out of ten new member states would have to take drastic measures to bring their deficits down below that ceiling .
the deficit in the czech republic is 12.9 percent , while hungary , cyprus and malta are also deeply in the red with deficits of 5.9 , 6.3 and 9.7 percent respectively .
this means that prague would have to reduce its deficit by approximately € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- before it can apply to join the single currency , assuming growth remains roughly constant .
the baltic states - estonia , lithuania and latvia - along with slovenia have sufficiently healthy finances to join the euro as soon as possible , but the others will either have to cut public spending or raise taxes to bring the deficits down to acceptable levels .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .
since the madrid bombings , france has boosted the number of soldiers at airports , train stations and other sites considered sensitive . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls for urgent european summit on terror germany 's interior minister otto schily has called for a meeting of european union ministers and security chiefs to convene as quickly as possible to discuss a possible new threat to eu countries from islamic extremists .

now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "

" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.03.2004 " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is under fire for being too graphic .
the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2004 german funeral discounter buries dead abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being laid to rest is n't cheap death in germany is expensive and many people have trouble paying it , especially during tough economic times .
to stem the costs of coffins , cremations and burials , berliners are discovering discount funeral parlors . traditionally in germany the deceased is laid out in a coffin .
family and friends meet at a chapel for a funeral service , after which the casket is carried to a grave and buried .
days later a gravestone is set at the head of the plot , telling the name and birth and death dates of the deceased . the average german funeral costs € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- , about double the average monthly income .
and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business . " when you bury a social welfare recipient or all the relatives are social welfare recipients , they all have to assume equal parts for the funeral and file the appropriate applications to the social welfare office , " funeral home director fritz told deutsche welle .
bargain coffins but there is an alternative .
germans can go to one of hartmut woite 's " berolina coffin discount " funeral parlors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i buy the coffins by the truck-load , " woite explained .
" they come with a truck direct from the factory and bring me 250 coffins .
that means i have a totally different price , and i can pass the savings on to my customers .
cremation costs € 250 . the wood 's not great and there 's no paint , no varnish , nothing . " but the casket and the undertaker just make up part of the costs .
families also have to pay for either a cemetery plot or for cremation .
here , too , woite has found a way to avoid the high price germany 's cities and towns charge for such services .
he sends corpses for cremation to the neighboring czech republic , where costs are significantly lower .
or customers can have their deceased buried in a czech cemetery .
corpse tourism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three times a week woite 's employees drive back and forth between germany and the czech republic .
and although german law requires corpses and ashes to be kept in graveyards , woite takes advantage of a loophole in the law so his customers can take their loved ones home in an urn . " earth mixed with ashes , there 's no law about that in germany , " woite explained .
" we bury over there and bring back the earth mixed with ashes , and that 's what i hand over to the people . " woite has been heavily criticized by competitors for his czech business .
they say he 's irreverent , and they call the journeys to the czech republic " corpse tourism . "
but that has n't stopped the undertaker .
he 's planning an organized bus trip to the czech republic in april so customers can see for themselves where they or their loved ones may one day be cremated . silke ballweg -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the american way of aldi a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”

and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2004 german funeral discounter buries dead abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being laid to rest is n't cheap death in germany is expensive and many people have trouble paying it , especially during tough economic times .
to stem the costs of coffins , cremations and burials , berliners are discovering discount funeral parlors . traditionally in germany the deceased is laid out in a coffin .
family and friends meet at a chapel for a funeral service , after which the casket is carried to a grave and buried .
days later a gravestone is set at the head of the plot , telling the name and birth and death dates of the deceased . the average german funeral costs € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,100 -rrb- , about double the average monthly income .
and with one-third of german households already in debt , many people are hard-pressed to shoulder the financial burden when a family member dies . social welfare recipients can apply for the state to assume the costs .
but the procedure is complicated , and funeral home directors like mike fritz from bonn do n't like to take on such business . " when you bury a social welfare recipient or all the relatives are social welfare recipients , they all have to assume equal parts for the funeral and file the appropriate applications to the social welfare office , " funeral home director fritz told deutsche welle .
bargain coffins but there is an alternative .
germans can go to one of hartmut woite 's " berolina coffin discount " funeral parlors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i buy the coffins by the truck-load , " woite explained .
" they come with a truck direct from the factory and bring me 250 coffins .
that means i have a totally different price , and i can pass the savings on to my customers .
cremation costs € 250 . the wood 's not great and there 's no paint , no varnish , nothing . " but the casket and the undertaker just make up part of the costs .
families also have to pay for either a cemetery plot or for cremation .
here , too , woite has found a way to avoid the high price germany 's cities and towns charge for such services .
he sends corpses for cremation to the neighboring czech republic , where costs are significantly lower .
or customers can have their deceased buried in a czech cemetery .
corpse tourism ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three times a week woite 's employees drive back and forth between germany and the czech republic .
and although german law requires corpses and ashes to be kept in graveyards , woite takes advantage of a loophole in the law so his customers can take their loved ones home in an urn . " earth mixed with ashes , there 's no law about that in germany , " woite explained .
" we bury over there and bring back the earth mixed with ashes , and that 's what i hand over to the people . " woite has been heavily criticized by competitors for his czech business .
they say he 's irreverent , and they call the journeys to the czech republic " corpse tourism . "

speaking at a special session of the parliament of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , rau said abuses of human rights in a country could no longer be viewed by the outside world as " domestic affairs " and that action must be taken at times .
but such action should only be conducted with broad support from the international community , he warned .
security today ca n't just be focused on the territory of one state , rau said .
with countries increasingly interlinked , there is no " believable alternative to policies of multilateralism , " he said , pointing to the recent iraq war and the earthquake catastrophe in iran as examples .
rau praised ecowas for its own multilateral success stories .
founded in 1975 , the bloc has now grown to include 15 countries and 220 million people .
like the european union , he said , ecowas has become much more than an economic block .
recently it has sent peacekeepers to stop regional conflicts in liberia and the ivory coast .
an indirect critique of islamic law without explicitly mentioning the fact that strict islamic law is practiced in northern nigeria , rau did indirectly criticize the practice of sharia law in his speech .
" freedom also means democratization and the guarantee of human rights , " and that requires decisive reforms of the justice system , he warned .
since 1999 , at least 12 states in nigeria have implemented sharia law , which has been the subject of international criticism because of its draconian penal measures - including the public stoning of women who engage in pre- or extra-marital sex .
germany 's president first arrived in africa on tuesday , when he was received by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo in his official residence in the capital of abuja .
rau is holding talks with political leaders in obasanjo 's government as well as the country 's senate and parliament as well as representatives of human rights organizations and churches .
he will spend one day in abuja and another in kano in the country 's northern quran belt .
between 50 and 60 million muslims live in nigeria , the largest concentration on the entire continent .
germany sees in nigeria an important partner for peacekeeping on the continent .
as one of the most powerful african countries , it can play a pivotal role in brokering peace in crisis regions .
" it 's one of the few countries in africa with a profile in peacekeeping , " stefen mair of the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" it also has the necessary capacities to do something and it has already -lrb- demonstrated -rrb- that in the past in liberia and sierra leone . "
visiting the troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's largest frigate , the bayern , at the port of djibouti .
after nigeria , rau will travel on friday to the former german colony of tanzania , home to the spectacular serengeti plain and kilimanjaro , africa 's highest mountain .
there he will meet with german navy sailors stationed as part of the " operation enduring freedom " deployment against international terrorism .
a total of 250 german soldiers are stationed at the horn of africa .
together , they are guarding the sea lanes in red sea and the gulf of aden from terrorism in concert with troops from the united states , france , italy , great britain and spain .
" tanzania has been one of germany 's longest and closest partners in development cooperation in africa , " mair explained .
" there 's a big affinity among tanzania 's elite for germany , and that 's been the case for 30 or 40 years .
it 's one of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- most reliable and comfortable partners . "
it 's also one of the poorest countries in africa , with very weak economic development .
nevertheless , it plays an extremely important role in the eastern africa region which has not been overlooked by berlin .
" it has a relatively low profile when it comes to foreign policy , but -lrb- tanzania -rrb- plays an important role in regional stability , " mair said .
" it 's main contribution is that the country has taken on a large number of refugees from rwanda and burundi at a high cost .
that 's much to tanzania 's credit . "
in all , rau will spend four days in tanzania , where he plans to meet with president benjamin william mkapa , visit the head of the international criminal tribunal for rwanda and the east african community secretariat and drop in on development projects in the country .
having foregone a bid for a second term as president , rau 's next trip will be to the pension office when the 73-year-old goes into retirement in just a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .

the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film .

his return is said to be prompted by changes made to existing laws by chancellor schröder 's government after the " florida rolf " case sparked outrage across the nation .
the new rules no longer treat the misuse of germany 's generous welfare system with benevolence and only allow germans living abroad to draw social benefits under special conditions , none of which apply to " florida rolf . "
the former bank manager had been justifying his lifestyle on the grounds of a certificate issued by a psychiatrist , attesting that rolf john was n't psychologically cut for a life in gloomy germany and was prone to commit suicide if he lived there .
but " florida rolf " is n't unduly worried about his financial future after the elimination of his monthly handouts of € 1,600 .
he told news magazine spiegel that he had hardly paid into germany 's pension coffers so far , but that " there 's a new basic pension rate since last year for people like me .
i believe that 's higher than the social welfare limit . " dw-world.de germans outraged over “ florida rolf ” case a controversial case of a florida-based german pensioner drawing huge welfare benefits from germany has sparked an angry debate among politicians and led the government to review the country ’ s welfare laws .

speaking at a special session of the parliament of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , rau said abuses of human rights in a country could no longer be viewed by the outside world as " domestic affairs " and that action must be taken at times .
but such action should only be conducted with broad support from the international community , he warned .
security today ca n't just be focused on the territory of one state , rau said .
with countries increasingly interlinked , there is no " believable alternative to policies of multilateralism , " he said , pointing to the recent iraq war and the earthquake catastrophe in iran as examples .
rau praised ecowas for its own multilateral success stories .
founded in 1975 , the bloc has now grown to include 15 countries and 220 million people .
like the european union , he said , ecowas has become much more than an economic block .
recently it has sent peacekeepers to stop regional conflicts in liberia and the ivory coast .
an indirect critique of islamic law without explicitly mentioning the fact that strict islamic law is practiced in northern nigeria , rau did indirectly criticize the practice of sharia law in his speech .
" freedom also means democratization and the guarantee of human rights , " and that requires decisive reforms of the justice system , he warned .
since 1999 , at least 12 states in nigeria have implemented sharia law , which has been the subject of international criticism because of its draconian penal measures - including the public stoning of women who engage in pre- or extra-marital sex .
germany 's president first arrived in africa on tuesday , when he was received by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo in his official residence in the capital of abuja .
rau is holding talks with political leaders in obasanjo 's government as well as the country 's senate and parliament as well as representatives of human rights organizations and churches .
he will spend one day in abuja and another in kano in the country 's northern quran belt .
between 50 and 60 million muslims live in nigeria , the largest concentration on the entire continent .
germany sees in nigeria an important partner for peacekeeping on the continent .
as one of the most powerful african countries , it can play a pivotal role in brokering peace in crisis regions .
" it 's one of the few countries in africa with a profile in peacekeeping , " stefen mair of the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" it also has the necessary capacities to do something and it has already -lrb- demonstrated -rrb- that in the past in liberia and sierra leone . "
visiting the troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's largest frigate , the bayern , at the port of djibouti .
after nigeria , rau will travel on friday to the former german colony of tanzania , home to the spectacular serengeti plain and kilimanjaro , africa 's highest mountain .
there he will meet with german navy sailors stationed as part of the " operation enduring freedom " deployment against international terrorism .
a total of 250 german soldiers are stationed at the horn of africa .
together , they are guarding the sea lanes in red sea and the gulf of aden from terrorism in concert with troops from the united states , france , italy , great britain and spain .
" tanzania has been one of germany 's longest and closest partners in development cooperation in africa , " mair explained .
" there 's a big affinity among tanzania 's elite for germany , and that 's been the case for 30 or 40 years .
it 's one of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- most reliable and comfortable partners . "
it 's also one of the poorest countries in africa , with very weak economic development .
nevertheless , it plays an extremely important role in the eastern africa region which has not been overlooked by berlin .
" it has a relatively low profile when it comes to foreign policy , but -lrb- tanzania -rrb- plays an important role in regional stability , " mair said .
" it 's main contribution is that the country has taken on a large number of refugees from rwanda and burundi at a high cost .
that 's much to tanzania 's credit . "
in all , rau will spend four days in tanzania , where he plans to meet with president benjamin william mkapa , visit the head of the international criminal tribunal for rwanda and the east african community secretariat and drop in on development projects in the country .
having foregone a bid for a second term as president , rau 's next trip will be to the pension office when the 73-year-old goes into retirement in just a few weeks . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president the head of the international monetary fund , horst köhler , is likely to become germany 's next president after he was officially nominated on thursday as the candidate of the country 's conservative and liberal parties .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

barges that can carry 2,000 tons are now loading two-thirds that amount to reduce their draft and avoid running aground .
not enough rain fell in central europe this winter to replenish the river after it fell to its lowest in nearly 60 years last summer , following three months of heat waves and drought .
" we 've hardly seen any rain this winter , and with river levels already low going into winter , the situation has become more tense , " peter kulsen , a consultant at freight tracking firm pjk international bv told bloomberg .
" we 're hoping ice on the mountains will melt soon and river levels will recover , but at the moment , it 's just not happening .

speaking at a special session of the parliament of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , rau said abuses of human rights in a country could no longer be viewed by the outside world as " domestic affairs " and that action must be taken at times .
but such action should only be conducted with broad support from the international community , he warned .
security today ca n't just be focused on the territory of one state , rau said .
with countries increasingly interlinked , there is no " believable alternative to policies of multilateralism , " he said , pointing to the recent iraq war and the earthquake catastrophe in iran as examples .
rau praised ecowas for its own multilateral success stories .
founded in 1975 , the bloc has now grown to include 15 countries and 220 million people .
like the european union , he said , ecowas has become much more than an economic block .
recently it has sent peacekeepers to stop regional conflicts in liberia and the ivory coast .
an indirect critique of islamic law without explicitly mentioning the fact that strict islamic law is practiced in northern nigeria , rau did indirectly criticize the practice of sharia law in his speech .
" freedom also means democratization and the guarantee of human rights , " and that requires decisive reforms of the justice system , he warned .
since 1999 , at least 12 states in nigeria have implemented sharia law , which has been the subject of international criticism because of its draconian penal measures - including the public stoning of women who engage in pre- or extra-marital sex .
germany 's president first arrived in africa on tuesday , when he was received by nigerian president olusegun obasanjo in his official residence in the capital of abuja .
rau is holding talks with political leaders in obasanjo 's government as well as the country 's senate and parliament as well as representatives of human rights organizations and churches .
he will spend one day in abuja and another in kano in the country 's northern quran belt .
between 50 and 60 million muslims live in nigeria , the largest concentration on the entire continent .
germany sees in nigeria an important partner for peacekeeping on the continent .
as one of the most powerful african countries , it can play a pivotal role in brokering peace in crisis regions .
" it 's one of the few countries in africa with a profile in peacekeeping , " stefen mair of the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" it also has the necessary capacities to do something and it has already -lrb- demonstrated -rrb- that in the past in liberia and sierra leone . "
visiting the troops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy 's largest frigate , the bayern , at the port of djibouti .
after nigeria , rau will travel on friday to the former german colony of tanzania , home to the spectacular serengeti plain and kilimanjaro , africa 's highest mountain .
there he will meet with german navy sailors stationed as part of the " operation enduring freedom " deployment against international terrorism .
a total of 250 german soldiers are stationed at the horn of africa .
together , they are guarding the sea lanes in red sea and the gulf of aden from terrorism in concert with troops from the united states , france , italy , great britain and spain .
" tanzania has been one of germany 's longest and closest partners in development cooperation in africa , " mair explained .
" there 's a big affinity among tanzania 's elite for germany , and that 's been the case for 30 or 40 years .
it 's one of -lrb- germany 's -rrb- most reliable and comfortable partners . "
it 's also one of the poorest countries in africa , with very weak economic development .
nevertheless , it plays an extremely important role in the eastern africa region which has not been overlooked by berlin .
" it has a relatively low profile when it comes to foreign policy , but -lrb- tanzania -rrb- plays an important role in regional stability , " mair said .
" it 's main contribution is that the country has taken on a large number of refugees from rwanda and burundi at a high cost .
that 's much to tanzania 's credit . "
in all , rau will spend four days in tanzania , where he plans to meet with president benjamin william mkapa , visit the head of the international criminal tribunal for rwanda and the east african community secretariat and drop in on development projects in the country .

speaking at a special session of the parliament of the economic community of west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- , rau said abuses of human rights in a country could no longer be viewed by the outside world as " domestic affairs " and that action must be taken at times .
but such action should only be conducted with broad support from the international community , he warned .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .

german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.03.2004 " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is under fire for being too graphic .
the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2004 german press review : brave new digital world german papers on wednesday commented on the opening of the computer trade fair cebit and a german supreme court decision to strike down a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs . on the day of the opening of the annual german computer trade fair cebit , german editorials reflected on the state of affairs in the computer industry .
the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- while many spaniards continue to link the attacks in madrid to their former government 's stance on iraq , günther beckstein -lrb- photo -rrb- from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- warned that germany 's role in the fight against the taliban in afghanistan had put the country " in the field of vision of osama bin laden . "
agreeing that hysteria was counter-productive , beckstein added that to give an " all-clear " on the status of threat posed against germany would be worse .
friedbert pflüger , cdu foreign policy spokesperson , added that " we are in the crosshairs of the terrorists . " however , uwe schünemann , the conservative minister of the interior for the state of lower saxony agreed with otto schily 's statement at the weekend that that there was no evidence of imminent danger concerning attacks by islamic extremists in germany . countries consider threat other european union countries were considering what action to take as concerns swept across the continent of a new campaign by al qaeda , if indeed the madrid bombings were the work of an affiliated group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london commuters at an underground station .
britain announced on sunday that undercover counter-terrorism officers had been on the london underground system since the beginning of this year .
simon lubin , a spokesman for the transport police , told reporters that the move was not a response to the madrid bombings and that there was no specific threat against the train system . poland , which joins the european union in may , was considering its own future as a possible terrorist target .
zbigniew siemiatkowski , the nation 's intelligence chief , told state radio 3 that the country could be in islamic terrorists ' sights .
" we can not escape the hypothesis that we are a target , " siemiatkowski said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish troops discuss the possible deployment of the multinational force in south central iraq .
poland was one of the staunchest supporters of the iraq war and now oversees 9,000 international peacekeepers in the country .
last year , poland and spain , also a u.s. ally in iraq , were named as possible targets on a taped message attributed to al qaeda leader osama bin laden .
the country 's lack of experience in dealing with terrorists could make it an easy place for them to hit , siemiatkowski said .
" we have untested structures and zero experience in reacting to this kind of event , " he said . italy announced it was sending a team of police and security officials to spain to collaborate on the investigation .
the interior ministry said security in italy appeared adequate but international collaboration in intelligence gathering and police investigations needed to be " reinforced . " in france , prime minister jean-pierre raffarin visited a train station to inspect newly tightened security measures and urged french people to watch for suspicious behavior .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .
german minister unhappy with spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- had already hinted on sunday that berlin was unhappy with spain 's lack of cooperation and withholding of information following the attacks .
german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "
the bka also complained that madrid restricted the sharing of information .
in an internal document dated sunday , the german criminal bureau wrote that spanish authorities " are being very circumspect about concrete information in view of the imminent election .
it would be desirable to have an open and trusting information policy .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .
their expulsion is possible only for serious reasons such as issues concerning public security and order . afghan deployment puts germany in cross-hairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein , innenminister in bayern , wartet am dienstag , 9 .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.03.2004 " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film is under fire for being too graphic .
the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .

german intelligence services only received the information from their spanish colleagues after " some delay , " the minister said , adding that " we obviously would have preferred to have been informed about certain details at an earlier stage than was the case . "

spanish authorities intentionally withheld information and misled german officials into believing the basque separatists eta were responsible for the madrid bombings , according to germany 's federal criminal bureau . in the days following the march 11 terror attacks that killed 201 people in madrid , spain 's intelligence authorities kept a tight seal on evidence related to the investigation and misled allied intelligence services by providing false information pointing to involvement by the eta , german public television reported tuesday .
citing a source in germany 's federal criminal bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , the national ard station said spanish investigators initially told a liaison official for the german intelligence service that the explosive used in the train bombs was titadyn , a material frequently employed by the eta in the past .
later they said it was goma 2 eco dynamite , an explosive the spanish authorities claimed was also used by eta .
it was n't until monday , a day after spain 's conservative government suffered a surprising loss in the general election , that officials in madrid admitted goma 2 explosives were not a type previously used by the basque separatists .
german officials were also not informed until after the election that the detonator found with the explosives was not a type used by eta .
moreover , after the arrest of three moroccans and two indians on saturday , spanish authorities continued to tell the german source in madrid that a connection to islamic circles could not be confirmed .
intentionally misleading ?
an unnamed high-ranking security official told ard that such blatantly false information from an allied intelligence service was " beyond his imagination . "
for the german authorities , whose task it was to evaluate their own country 's risk in the days following the attacks , the evidence about the explosives was the main reason why the bka assumed eta was behind the bombings .
outgoing spanish premier jose maria aznar has been criticized from all sides for his attempts to pressure the media into blaming the basque separatists rather than raising suspicion of islamic extremists .
only after a videotape in arabic was found claiming the blasts were the work of al qaeda did media attention and public opinion steer away from the official line .
at the same time , though , aznar repeatedly pointed his finger at eta and his interior ministry continued to cite evidence linking the attacks to the regional terror group .
" it was eta .
do not doubt it for a moment , " aznar was quoted as telling spanish journalists in personal phone calls urging them to print his statements .
spain 's interior minister angel acebes defended his government 's information policy .
" we always told the spanish people the truth , " he insisted .
the defeat of aznar 's party in the polls has been blamed to a large extent on the perception that the government manipulated information about the attacks to boost its chances in the election .
involvement by eta in the bombings would have lent more support to the ruling party , which built its platform on high profile arrests of the basque separatists .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .

the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday . mel gibson 's controversial film " the passion of the christ , " the actor-director 's blood-soaked account of the last hours of jesus christ , opens in germany on march 18 to audiences above the age of 16 .
while the german censors have approved the movie for young adults , the content of the film is already beginning to create controversy similar to that generated elsewhere .
the usual suspects have taken up their places on the side of the opposition , just as they have wherever gibson 's religious rollercoaster has rolled into town : church groups , jewish organizations and concerned social elders in germany have all started to voice their objections .
but while the familiar accusations of anti-semitism and misinterpretation begin to circulate , one factor that may cause equal debate in germany is the level of violence , guts and gore .
germany has strict laws controlling scenes of violence in everything from television shows and films to computer games .
therefore , the question should be : will " the passion " be too bloody for germans ?
blood may distract from message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jim caviezel as jesus christ .
representatives of the catholic church and the jewish faith have already criticized the film for its orgiastic blood-letting and the gory representation of the crucifixion in particular .
werner thissen , the archbishop of hamburg , recently went on german morning television to claim that the two-hour long film is so violent that it presents a danger that the spectator who is unfamiliar with the account in the four gospels will " see only the blood while missing the message of redemption . " thissen said the film was " full of blood and wounds , " adding that the cruel and bloody sequences were heavy to endure and had had a profoundly unpleasant effect on him . the archbishop added that film-goers should not only see " the passion " , but also take time to view the film by the catholic church that will accompany it in the cinema program . on-screen gore accused of pushing boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others have complained that the flagellation and crucifixion of christ is shown in such gratuitous detail as to set new levels of on-screen brutality , surpassing the scenes of carnage set on the beaches of normandy seen in steven spielberg 's world war ii drama " saving private ryan " and the seemingly endless , stylized murder in quentin tarantino 's " kill bill " movies . jewish author rafael seligmann said in on ard television that he was shaken by the power and inhumanity of the film .
seligmann added that he thought gibson 's film used the biblical message as " an alibi for violence . " however , many viewers , and mel gibson himself unsurprisingly , contend that the portrayal is as close to the reality of the events as could possibly be achieved , done so out of authenticity rather than titillation .
" i want the audience to feel , to understand what the man christ went through for us , " the director has been quoted as saying . jewish argument set for german arena bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the passion " is unlikely to escape the accusations of anti-semitism when it opens this week in germany .
the charges have been dogging the film since long before it was even released . jewish groups the worlds over have protested against the film , accusing it of entirely blaming the jews for the death of christ . michel friedman , the former vice-president of the central council of jews in germany , made his feelings clear in the bild zeitung tabloid recently : " anti-semitism in the disguise of a film . " " if young people see this film and take the message from it that the jews are responsible for the death of christ then this will have an explosive effect , one that we can not accept , " friedman said .
" this film is an irresponsible step backwards to the middle ages . " the protestant church in germany has also criticized " the passion of the christ " .
peter steinacker , president of the protestant church in hesse and nassau , said that the film fails to adequately explain the hatred directed at jesus by the people around him and that indirect anti-semitic sentiments are contained within the text . archbishop refutes anti-semitism claims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but archbishop thissen does not hold with the critics who claim the film is the anti-semitic , saying that he was unable to see any anti-semitic agenda in gibson 's representation of the biblical story .
" this is completely incorrect , " said the archbishop . gibson himself has explained that , through the physical and mental torment experienced by all the characters in the story , it can be clearly seen that everyone is to blame : " the message is not that the jews or the romans killed jesus but we are all responsible .

european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . european union countries have been caught up in a wave of discussion and debate since the madrid bombings , with many at odds within their own governments over what action to take to prevent similar attacks on home soil . the bombings that claimed 200 lives in madrid last week and sent shockwaves around the world have caused a frenzy of activity and discussion about security within governments across europe . while the attacks of september 11 , 2001 in the united states were seen as a crime against an important ally , the events of march 11 , 2004 have reminded european leaders that global terrorism can hit at home as well .
now , many are reassessing their own national security measures and the security of the eu as a whole . in germany on sunday , interior minister otto schily called for a european union summit to revise anti-terror measures across the bloc as soon as possible , appealing to the irish eu presidency to convene a security meeting at the earliest convenience .
as the likelihood of involvement by islamic extremists in the madrid bombings increases , schily has urged eu leaders to come together and assess what he called a " growing and wider threat to european union nations . " such a meeting , which has been penciled in for march 22 , would consist of interior ministers and security chiefs considering new measures to protect eu countries from terrorism .
however , schily warned of the possibility of causing panic and over-reaction in the wake of the attacks in spain and said , " we must remain sensible . "
krista sager , leader of the greens in the bundestag , also warned about hasty legislation in the wake of the madrid attacks , saying that " current events should not be used for party political gain . " german opposition calls for tighter immigration laws bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach .
but elsewhere , the proximity of the madrid bombings raised concern about germany 's position and attitude to possible new threats .
wolfgang bosbach -lrb- photo -rrb- of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- demanded that the government " close evident security gaps " and referred to the strengthening of immigration laws in the fight on terror . " this issue is inseparable from discussions on the immigration law , " bosbach told german broadcaster ard .
" we want to know whether the coalition is ready for changes in the rights of foreigners in a bid to increase security , and if yes , where in the law and in what capacity . " bosbach was clear on where his party stood on the matter .
" we want to facilitate the expulsion of extremist foreigners … and create the possibility to expel extremist foreigners even if they have not been prosecuted under criminal law . "
he added that a person who is found to be active in a prohibited extremist organization or has been involved in any action taken by such a group should be deported from the country .
" this must be sufficient to expel that person . " at the moment , there are barriers to the expulsion process in germany when the person involved is an approved asylum-seeker or a foreigner who is married to a german .

the cebit neither glitters nor shines anymore – that ’ s the somewhat sober verdict of der tagesspiegel in berlin .
but now that both visions and depressions are being wiped away , the path is open to take a look at the changes brought into people 's lives in recent years by mobile phones and the internet , laptops and digital cameras , the paper noted .
at the height of internet euphoria everyone believed that the new medium would radically alter people 's lives – but luckily that hasn ’ t occurred , wrote the paper . the message of this year ’ s cebit is clear , stated the handelsblatt in düsselorf : in order to compete on a global scale , enterprises would be well-advised to outsource their hard- and software , because computer companies could provide much cheaper solutions drawing on the help of indian or chinese it-specialists .
but as plausible as that sounds , it might be useful to rethink this piece of advice , suggested the paper .
after all it was the same computer industry which once claimed that internet and e-business would radically alter the laws of the business world .
but things developed differently , concluded the paper . other german dailies comment on a supreme court decision to end a federal ban on breeding dangerous dogs such as pit bulls or staffordshire terriers while prohibiting their import .
in the summer of 2000 politicians were destitute but yet determined to do something to protect society from dangerous dogs , recalled the kölner stadtanzeiger . the supreme court decision now reveals equal helplessness , the paper wrote .
the court disclaimed lists of dangerous races , charging they were unscientific and lacked statistical evidence , while at the same time contending these lists were nonetheless justifiable .
with its verdict , noted the cologne-based daily , the court has failed to take the opportunity to find a new path to contain excess in dog breeding . some editorials looked at the aftermath of the madrid bombings .
the spanish election results don ’ t have to be a victory for the terror network al qaeda , wrote the frankfurter rundschau .
and yet , it might still be seen as just that .
the paper believes that the spanish threat to withdraw its troops from iraq – unless the u.s. agrees to a un mandate – doesn ’ t mean the country is caving in to terrorists .
whoever believes that to be the case hasn ’ t followed what the new spanish prime minister has said , the daily wrote : first , he has declared the fight against terrorism to be his top priority .
second , by calling for a un resolution , he has found a way of spoiling the chance for al quaeda to turn the withdrawal into a victory for the organization . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung commented on tuesday ’ s meeting between german chancellor gerhard schröder with his french colleague jacques chirac in paris , where both leaders agreed to help streamline the european answer to terrorism .
that the two leaders want to make the fight against international terrorism a top priority in europe is reasonable and long overdue , the daily noted .
the german chancellor is probably right in saying that terrorism is here to stay for some time , agreed the paper .
that ’ s exactly what washington has been saying for two years .

mr kerry now has the support of 2,262 delegates - enough to secure him the democrat nomination at the party 's national convention in july .
he kicked off his campaign against president bush by promising supporters in west virginia " a great debate about the direction of our country " .
he also tried to fend off a bush ad questioning his support for us troops .
battle commences bbc washington correspondent michael buchanan says mr kerry 's overwhelming victory in illinois gives him the democrat nomination that had for the last two weeks been viewed as almost a formality .
but in truth , says our correspondent , mr kerry 's work has just begun .
the president is busy trying to blame everyone else except his own administration john kerry president bush 's campaign is the best financed in american history , having raised more than $ 140m towards his re-election efforts .
some of that money went on the bush campaign 's latest television ad , which accused mr kerry of voting against higher combat pay and better health care for reservists .
on tuesday night , mr kerry called the ad " another distortion " , arguing that he would have supported funding for the troops if mr bush had eased tax cuts to avoid increasing the us deficit .
" the president is busy trying to blame everyone else except his own administration , " mr kerry told veterans in huntington , west virginia - one of the key battleground states of the presidential race .
" nothing is more important than telling the american people the truth about the economy , health care , and war and peace .
this administration has yet to level with the american people . "
iraq question mr kerry also commented on a pledge by spain 's newly elected prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , to pull spanish troops out of iraq if the united nations does not take command of forces there .
" in my judgment , the new prime minister should not have decided he was going to pull out of iraq , " he said .
" he should have said this : ' this -lrb- the madrid bombings -rrb- increases our determination to get the job done , ' . "
in a speech on wednesday , vice president dick cheney is expected to keep up the republican attack on mr kerry by daring him to commit to continue the administration 's policies in iraq and the so-called " war on terror " .

public transport body centro plans to build two new lines in birmingham and one in the black country as the next step towards a complete network .
about £ 400m of government funding has already been set aside for the scheme that could see trams running by 2011 .
the plans are in addition to new lines through birmingham and to dudley .
rob donald , from centro , said the plan would help address the issue of traffic congestion .
" the benefits for people living and working in the west midlands will be substantial , " he said .
consultants predict about 25 million passengers would use the modern tram system , while an opinion poll suggested as many as a quarter of rush hour motorists would be tempted away from their cars .

the bridge would be one of the longest in the world and would link liverpool with birkenhead and the rest of wirral .
the idea for the project was floated by councillor flo clucas , executive member for community safety , last week .
funding for the project would be provided by the european union if its objective 1 programme grants the city an extra £ 600m in 2006 .
a spokesman said a bridge across the mersey would give tourists access to the best possible view of liverpool 's waterfront .
visitors would be able to see the newly-regenerated area , which the council hopes will by then include the fourth grace , kings dock arena and new cruise liner terminal at princes dock .
the bridge would have to have a retractable section to allow ships to sail into the docks .
cllr flo clucas told bbc news online the idea had already captured many people 's imaginations .
she said : " it is an interesting idea , and one that is open for debate and discussion .
" it is something that we will discuss and open up to public debate . "
merseyside and other areas of the uk like cornwall , west wales and south yorkshire , qualify for the funding as they are among the poorest areas of the 15 nations in the eu .
there were fears the region would miss out on further funding when 10 other european countries become members on 1 may .
cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia will be joining the union .

these war veterans , in their early 60s , fought in the east croatian town from the first day of the conflict to its fall , coming alive out of a gruelling three-month siege by serb forces .
their sons did not make it .
nor did hundreds of other croats who were executed after the town fell .
thirteen years on , serb soldiers are in court for the first major war crimes trial in serbia .
they are accused of one of the worst atrocities of the conflict that took place at vukovar 's pig farm , ovcara .
vukovar , known to croats as the " city of heroes " , was one of the most comprehensively destroyed towns during the wars of the former yugoslavia .
the city became a symbol of stuggle against the yugoslav army and rebel serbs , who had captured much of the surrounding region of eastern slavonia after croatia declared independence in 1991 .
different world life in this picturesque town used to be different .
" we lived door to door with our serb neighbours and never had problems until 1991 , " says josip jugec .
this was before many serbs left vukovar or were driven out - some to fight alongside the yugoslav army .
the belgrade trial gives no satisfaction to mr jugec .
" nobody 's going to bring me back my son , " he says , hailing the trial only as " a small bit of justice being done " .
both mr jugec and mr psenica know people on trial in belgrade .
they also knew mirko vojnovic , who died on the eve of the trial from injuries sustained in a suicide attempt in january .
mr jugec is convinced some of his former serb neighbours know who killed his son and where .
" but they do n't want to tell me any names .
maybe that 's better , because i do n't know what i would do to the person who killed my 19-year old boy , " he says .
' too late ' croatian human rights campaigner zarko puhovski calls the current belgrade process a possible precedent in war crimes proceedings in the balkans .
" the problem is that the trial has come much too late for the crimes that happened 13 years ago .
many people from vukovar have waited for years for this to happen and have become desperate meanwhile , " says mr puhovski .
his words are echoed by ivan psenica .
" the perpetrators have to be found .
there will be no peace , until criminals are brought to justice " , he says , pausing to catch his breath .
mr jugec and mr psenica remember the past while watching a british documentary on vukovar , shot after it fell to serb forces .
the tape shows serb paramilitaries parading in the streets , waving bottles and singing : " we will have meat , we will have meat , we will slaughter the croats . "
croats are still haunted by these chilling pictures .
many still vividly remember british television pictures of the local hospital where 300 croatians - many of them members of the national guard - were taken prisoner .
these pictures were their last , before they were transferred to ovcara farm and brutally massacred by serb forces .
forensic analysis showed that most of the victims were killed by a shot in the head .
others were hit in the head with a blunt object .
dead bodies were thrown in a mass grave .
new mass grave unfortunately , ovcara is not the only mass grave the war left behind .
just a day after the trial in belgrade began , the croatian government opened up another mass grave in slavonia .
they believe this one could turn out to be even bigger then ovcara .
the horror of vukovar remains in the minds of many croats and not just war veterans .
some will hope to recognise their children in one of the mass graves .
some will hope to forget everything .

these war veterans , in their early 60s , fought in the east croatian town from the first day of the conflict to its fall , coming alive out of a gruelling three-month siege by serb forces .
serb paramilitary soldiers rejoice after capturing vukovar in 1991 their sons did not make it .
nor did hundreds of other croats who were executed after the town fell .
thirteen years on , serb soldiers are in court for the first major war crimes trial in serbia .
they are accused of one of the worst atrocities of the conflict that took place at vukovar 's pig farm , ovcara .
vukovar , known to croats as the " city of heroes " , was one of the most comprehensively destroyed towns during the wars of the former yugoslavia .
the city became a symbol of struggle against the yugoslav army and rebel serbs , who had captured much of the surrounding region of eastern slavonia after croatia declared independence in 1991 .
different world life in this picturesque town used to be different .
" we lived door to door with our serb neighbours and never had problems until 1991 , " says josip jugec .
mr jugec says no-one will bring him back his son this was before many serbs left vukovar or were driven out - some to fight alongside the yugoslav army .
the belgrade trial gives no satisfaction to mr jugec .
" nobody 's going to bring me back my son , " he says , hailing the trial only as " a small bit of justice being done " .
both mr jugec and mr psenica know people on trial in belgrade .
they also knew mirko vojnovic , who died on the eve of the trial from injuries sustained in a suicide attempt in january .
mr jugec is convinced some of his former serb neighbours know who killed his son and where .
" but they do n't want to tell me any names .
maybe that 's better , because i do n't know what i would do to the person who killed my 19-year old boy , " he says .
' too late ' croatian human rights campaigner zarko puhovski calls the current belgrade process a possible precedent in war crimes proceedings in the balkans .
mr psenica wants the perpetrators of the massacre to be found " the problem is that the trial has come much too late for the crimes that happened 13 years ago .
many people from vukovar have waited for years for this to happen and have become desperate meanwhile , " says mr puhovski .
his words are echoed by ivan psenica .
" the perpetrators have to be found .
there will be no peace , until criminals are brought to justice " , he says , pausing to catch his breath .
mr jugec and mr psenica remember the past while watching a british documentary on vukovar , shot after it fell to serb forces .
the tape shows serb paramilitaries parading in the streets , waving bottles and singing : " we will have meat , we will have meat , we will slaughter the croats . "
croats are still haunted by these chilling pictures .
many still vividly remember british television pictures of the local hospital where 300 croatians - many of them members of the national guard - were taken prisoner .
these pictures were their last , before they were transferred to ovcara farm and brutally massacred by serb forces .
forensic analysis showed that most of the victims were killed by a shot in the head .
others were hit in the head with a blunt object .
dead bodies were thrown in a mass grave .
new mass grave unfortunately , ovcara is not the only mass grave the war left behind .
just a day after the trial in belgrade began , the croatian government opened up another mass grave in slavonia .
they believe this one could turn out to be even bigger then ovcara .
the horror of vukovar remains in the minds of many croats and not just war veterans .
some will hope to recognise their children in one of the mass graves .
some will hope to forget everything .

the outbreak at the james cook hospital has so far affected 46 people across three wards .
infection control staff have said they are doing all they can to control the outbreak of the stomach bug .
the first case was confirmed at the beginning of march , but hospital bosses say there is no cause for alarm and the virus is not life-threatening .
restricting movement so far , 22 staff and 24 patients have developed the infection following the outbreak in wards nine , 10 and 11 .
measures are being taken to stop it spreading , including restricting the movement of patients to other wards .
staff who come down with symptoms have been told to stay off work until they are deemed " non infectious " , to reduce the risk to patients .
the hospital is also advising anyone who is not in good health , such as those who are being treated with steroids , to consider if their visit is necessary and to be aware of the risk of infection , people who do visit are advised to wash their hands before entering the ward and when they leave .

it says the pension being offered to the 21 workers being transferred to the private firm is " grossly inferior " to what they could have expected .
the co-op says they will be offered good opportunities in the new company .

from now on property seized from drug-traffickers will be sold to raise money for prisons , so criminals will in effect be paying for their internment .
the government says it will build 15 new prisons over the next 10 years , financed in the main by drug-traffickers ' assets .
the $ 200m project aims to create places for about 24,000 prisoners .
massive overcrowding drug-trafficking is at the root of much of colombia 's crime and has fuelled the 40-year civil conflict .
a government campaign has been launched to seize all property and assets gained from the proceeds of drug-trafficking to alleviate massive overcrowding and to make room for the thousands of suspects awaiting trial .
only last week , police seized 200 properties believed to be owned by members of the norte del valle drugs cartel .
these will be added to the thousands of houses , cars and even aeroplanes now in the grip of the colombian government .

it is the worst outbreak in the region for more than four years .
many millions of locusts are thought to be on the move heavy rains that ended a long drought have provided ideal breeding conditions for the insects .
hundreds of thousands of hectares of agricultural land are being sprayed in an effort to combat this locust plague .
one farmer in new south wales said that he expected so many locusts to descend on his property that they would block out the sun .
he also feared that clothes on his washing line would be devoured by this army of tiny eating machines .
voracious it is impossible to know just how extensive these swarms are .
experts have estimated that many millions of these voracious insects are on the move .
their numbers have been swelled by heavy rains which have triggered a surge in breeding .

in some cases crops have disappeared overnight .
locusts can travel several hundred kilometres looking for their next meal .
what makes this outbreak so unpredictable is the weather .
the insects go where the winds take them .

the main weapon in the fight against them is the aerial spraying of insecticides .
it has had a major impact in parts of southern queensland .
the aim is to kill the baby locusts or hoppers before they are able to fly .
this plague is a further blow to many australian farmers who are still trying to recover from one of the worst droughts seen in the last 100 years .

outgoing deputy judy beaugeard believes groups like drug concern are losing their effectiveness because they are becoming too closely tied to politics .
deputy beaugeard founded guernsey 's drug concern in 1991 .
although she is no longer involved with the organisation she says she is concerned it is becoming " bogged down " in politics .
she believes groups like dads and mums against drugs have come about because official channels have become blocked .
deputy beaugeard is taking a career break and will not be standing for election but says she would like to see more separation from politics for organisations like drug concern .
