program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test eu parliament approves constitution all eu hopes on spain ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' germany -pipe- 25.07.2004 a referendum for germany after all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the people decide ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test eu parliament approves constitution all eu hopes on spain ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' germany -pipe- 25.07.2004 a referendum for germany after all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the people decide ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .

after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2004 malta 's uncertain harbor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a safe haven for stranded refugees .
since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .
eu foreign ministers will meet on monday to discuss the situation in darfur and the possibility of european action in the region . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer pressures sudan to act to avert tragedy german foreign minister joschka fischer has held discussions with the sudanese president and foreign minister , saying the eu and germany will only provide aid if sudan acts to resolve the crisis in the darfur region .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .
months , years - their fate is uncertain . barbara gruber -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's invisible walls illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean sea at a higher risk than ever before .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .

according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily was originally opposed to asylum centers in north africa but changed his mind after the cap anamur incident .
" i believe that north african countries also have to be interested in preventing things from continuing as they are , " schily said in a meeting of eu interior and justice ministers last week .
coalition partners , however , are opposed to the plan .
the greens said the establishment of an asylum center outside the union would violate europe 's humanitarian principles and send the message that the " boat is full . "
green criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer joins his greens party colleagues in opposing eu asylum centers in north africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- greens -rrb- was unusually frank in his criticism of shily 's proposal .
" i disagree with it completely , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
the plan has n't been thought out in terms of the humanitarian aspects , he stressed .
it 's much more important " to first get involved in the situation in africa and give the people there a perspective , " he added .
angelika beer , greens co-chairwoman , spoke out against the plain in a similarly critical manner last week .
" people in need will have to be able to reach europe in the future as well , " she said and proposed instead that eu refugee funds be increased to help fight the problem at its roots .
conservative fence-sitting the conservative opposition has n't quite made up its mind on the issue .
while angela merkel , head of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the creation of asylum centers in north africa as " a legitimate consideration , " and bavarian interior minister gunther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called it a " sensible idea , " wolfang bosbach , a legal expert for cdu , said the proposal was too vague .
bosbach said schily needed to provide more details on the eu 's role in running the centers especially considering the fact that brussels has not yet agreed on a european-wide asylum policy . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's invisible walls illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean sea at a higher risk than ever before .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2004 malta 's uncertain harbor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a safe haven for stranded refugees .
since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .
months , years - their fate is uncertain . barbara gruber -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's invisible walls illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean sea at a higher risk than ever before .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .

with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "
sprinting ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now six-time tour de france winner lance armstrong flanked by second-placed andreas klöden of germany -lrb- left -rrb- and third-placed ivan basso of italy .
in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .
" i am totally proud , " klöden said basking in the winner 's champagne .
" it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to stand here on the podium . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is ullrich 's tour already over ?
jan ullrich 's hopes of winning the tour de france took a blow this weekend after the german failed to keep pace with defending champion lance armstrong in the first mountain stages .

no wonder it 's become one of the sporting world 's biggest businesses .

a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .
months , years - their fate is uncertain . barbara gruber -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's invisible walls illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean sea at a higher risk than ever before .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .

angelika beer , greens co-chairwoman , spoke out against the plain in a similarly critical manner last week .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily was originally opposed to asylum centers in north africa but changed his mind after the cap anamur incident .
" i believe that north african countries also have to be interested in preventing things from continuing as they are , " schily said in a meeting of eu interior and justice ministers last week .
coalition partners , however , are opposed to the plan .
the greens said the establishment of an asylum center outside the union would violate europe 's humanitarian principles and send the message that the " boat is full . "
green criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer joins his greens party colleagues in opposing eu asylum centers in north africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- greens -rrb- was unusually frank in his criticism of shily 's proposal .
" i disagree with it completely , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
the plan has n't been thought out in terms of the humanitarian aspects , he stressed .
it 's much more important " to first get involved in the situation in africa and give the people there a perspective , " he added .
angelika beer , greens co-chairwoman , spoke out against the plain in a similarly critical manner last week .
" people in need will have to be able to reach europe in the future as well , " she said and proposed instead that eu refugee funds be increased to help fight the problem at its roots .
conservative fence-sitting the conservative opposition has n't quite made up its mind on the issue .
while angela merkel , head of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the creation of asylum centers in north africa as " a legitimate consideration , " and bavarian interior minister gunther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called it a " sensible idea , " wolfang bosbach , a legal expert for cdu , said the proposal was too vague .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .

unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "
sprinting ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now six-time tour de france winner lance armstrong flanked by second-placed andreas klöden of germany -lrb- left -rrb- and third-placed ivan basso of italy .
in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .
" i am totally proud , " klöden said basking in the winner 's champagne .
" it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to stand here on the podium . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is ullrich 's tour already over ?
jan ullrich 's hopes of winning the tour de france took a blow this weekend after the german failed to keep pace with defending champion lance armstrong in the first mountain stages .

klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "
sprinting ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now six-time tour de france winner lance armstrong flanked by second-placed andreas klöden of germany -lrb- left -rrb- and third-placed ivan basso of italy .
in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .
" i am totally proud , " klöden said basking in the winner 's champagne .
" it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to stand here on the podium . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is ullrich 's tour already over ?
jan ullrich 's hopes of winning the tour de france took a blow this weekend after the german failed to keep pace with defending champion lance armstrong in the first mountain stages .
-lrb- july 17 , 2004 -rrb- tour de france is a financial tour de force the tour de france attracts over 15 million spectators to the streets with a further billion happy to watch at home .
no wonder it 's become one of the sporting world 's biggest businesses .

a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .

the accident was among the worst in the country 's history .
critics blame the government which pushed for the rail project , despite safety concerns over the aging tracks .
three rail engineers from germany 's railroad authority visited the site as part of an independent investigation designed to find the cause for the derailment which occurred most likely because the train on the heavily-traveled istanbul-ankara track surpassed the speed limit .
although turkey has invited experts from other countries to take part in the investigation , no others have arrived yet .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .

the plan has n't been thought out in terms of the humanitarian aspects , he stressed .
it 's much more important " to first get involved in the situation in africa and give the people there a perspective , " he added .
angelika beer , greens co-chairwoman , spoke out against the plain in a similarly critical manner last week .
" people in need will have to be able to reach europe in the future as well , " she said and proposed instead that eu refugee funds be increased to help fight the problem at its roots .
conservative fence-sitting the conservative opposition has n't quite made up its mind on the issue .

interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2004 malta 's uncertain harbor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a safe haven for stranded refugees .
since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .

" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .

the blast came after the barge had discharged its load of naphtha in essen in northwestern germany and had anchored for the night in the rhein-herne canal , a spokesman for the local police said .
the impact of the blast was so powerful that it blew out windows in nearby buildings .
german television showed the barge 's tanks reduced to twisted metal from the heat but the vessel remained afloat .
it was not known what caused the explosion .

the accident was among the worst in the country 's history .
critics blame the government which pushed for the rail project , despite safety concerns over the aging tracks .
three rail engineers from germany 's railroad authority visited the site as part of an independent investigation designed to find the cause for the derailment which occurred most likely because the train on the heavily-traveled istanbul-ankara track surpassed the speed limit .
although turkey has invited experts from other countries to take part in the investigation , no others have arrived yet .
germany has a special connection to the turkish rail system , as many of the tracks date back to the 19th century , when the then-german monarchy helped build them for the ottoman empire . more briefs 25.07.2004 -pipe- chemical barge explodes on german canal 23.07.2004 -pipe- police raid mosques in southern germany 23.07.2004 -pipe- bavarian minister attacks berlin 's visa policy 23.07.2004 -pipe- fdp wants coalition with cdu in 2006 23.07.2004 -pipe- east german border killings retrial begins 22.07.2004 -pipe- italy deports 27 africans from german aid ship 22.07.2004 -pipe- schily details plans for asylum centers 22.07.2004 -pipe- germans flood economy minister 's phone line radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily was originally opposed to asylum centers in north africa but changed his mind after the cap anamur incident .
" i believe that north african countries also have to be interested in preventing things from continuing as they are , " schily said in a meeting of eu interior and justice ministers last week .
coalition partners , however , are opposed to the plan .
the greens said the establishment of an asylum center outside the union would violate europe 's humanitarian principles and send the message that the " boat is full . "
green criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer joins his greens party colleagues in opposing eu asylum centers in north africa .
foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- greens -rrb- was unusually frank in his criticism of shily 's proposal .
" i disagree with it completely , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
the plan has n't been thought out in terms of the humanitarian aspects , he stressed .
it 's much more important " to first get involved in the situation in africa and give the people there a perspective , " he added .
angelika beer , greens co-chairwoman , spoke out against the plain in a similarly critical manner last week .
" people in need will have to be able to reach europe in the future as well , " she said and proposed instead that eu refugee funds be increased to help fight the problem at its roots .
conservative fence-sitting the conservative opposition has n't quite made up its mind on the issue .
while angela merkel , head of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , endorsed the creation of asylum centers in north africa as " a legitimate consideration , " and bavarian interior minister gunther beckstein of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- called it a " sensible idea , " wolfang bosbach , a legal expert for cdu , said the proposal was too vague .
bosbach said schily needed to provide more details on the eu 's role in running the centers especially considering the fact that brussels has not yet agreed on a european-wide asylum policy . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's invisible walls illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean sea at a higher risk than ever before .

the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2004 malta 's uncertain harbor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a safe haven for stranded refugees .
since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test eu parliament approves constitution all eu hopes on spain ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' germany -pipe- 25.07.2004 a referendum for germany after all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the people decide ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .

lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the rocky road to an eu constitution putting the constitution to the test eu parliament approves constitution all eu hopes on spain ratifying eu constitution will be a ' tough battle ' germany -pipe- 25.07.2004 a referendum for germany after all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the people decide ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "
sprinting ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now six-time tour de france winner lance armstrong flanked by second-placed andreas klöden of germany -lrb- left -rrb- and third-placed ivan basso of italy .
in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .
" i am totally proud , " klöden said basking in the winner 's champagne .
" it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to stand here on the podium . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is ullrich 's tour already over ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2004 malta 's uncertain harbor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a safe haven for stranded refugees .
since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .
blair has called on the international community to take moral responsibility for resolving the crisis and is sending foreign secretary jack straw to the region next month .
france , which used its security council seat to block a un resolution authorizing war against iraq last year , plans to send foreign minister michel barnier on a three-day african trip that includes darfur and is meant to show support for a planned african union mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in khartoum , july 11 , 2004 .
fischer , who has been campaigning for a permanent german seat on the security council , was in sudan earlier this month and has been a strong advocate of increasing international involvement in solving the conflict .
he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .
dutch foreign minister ben bot told his sudanese counterpart that sanctions were not yet needed , but he said the international community would eventually impose them if khartoum did not act .
" if the situation does not visibly improve , then sanctions will almost surely be brought by the international community , " dutch news agency anp quoted bot as saying .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "
sprinting ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now six-time tour de france winner lance armstrong flanked by second-placed andreas klöden of germany -lrb- left -rrb- and third-placed ivan basso of italy .
in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .
" i am totally proud , " klöden said basking in the winner 's champagne .
" it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to stand here on the podium . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is ullrich 's tour already over ?
jan ullrich 's hopes of winning the tour de france took a blow this weekend after the german failed to keep pace with defending champion lance armstrong in the first mountain stages .
-lrb- july 17 , 2004 -rrb- tour de france is a financial tour de force the tour de france attracts over 15 million spectators to the streets with a further billion happy to watch at home .

after the interior minister proposed the creation of eu asylum centers in north africa , opposition leader angela merkel endorsed the plan as " legitimate . "
foreign minister joschka fischer was far less supportive . as illegal immigration hits the news over the events surrounding the odyssey of the german relief ship cap anamur and the plight of dozens of africans plucked from the mediterranean , german politicians have begun taking sides on a british plan to build eu asylum centers in north africa .
interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily was originally opposed to asylum centers in north africa but changed his mind after the cap anamur incident .

" i disagree with it completely , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
the plan has n't been thought out in terms of the humanitarian aspects , he stressed .
it 's much more important " to first get involved in the situation in africa and give the people there a perspective , " he added .
angelika beer , greens co-chairwoman , spoke out against the plain in a similarly critical manner last week .
" people in need will have to be able to reach europe in the future as well , " she said and proposed instead that eu refugee funds be increased to help fight the problem at its roots .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.07.2004 malta 's uncertain harbor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a safe haven for stranded refugees .
since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .
the greens have also signaled a willingness to move forward on similar legislation that would allow for referendums on issues that start as citizen 's initiatives .
green parliamentarian josef winkler said in a statement on saturday that members in the ruling coalition would soon put forth such a proposal .
noting the difference between a referendum that starts out as a private citizen 's initiative and those coming from the government , winkler said , " referendums initiated by parliament are not foreseen . "
in his statement , winkler reiterated that the greens on a whole , unlike their de facto leader and german foreign minister joschka fischer , favored a europe-wide referendum on the eu constitution rather than separate votes at the national level .
a big risk a recent poll by the forsa institute found three out of four germans supported holding a referendum on the constitution .
a report in die welt newspaper on saturday also said 34 constitutional lawyers had signed their names on a paper arguing a referendum was not only possible but should be held .
but chancellor schröder has resisted calls to follow britain and hold a popular vote .
he has said there is unlikely to be the required two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament to change germany 's constitution to allow a referendum .
there is also the risk that if a referendum is held , the eu constitution could be rejected , thereby nullifying it across the entire bloc and throwing the eu back to the drawing board .
critics , however , point to the fact that the risk is not so high as in england , for example , where tony blair is taking a big gamble in putting the question to his countrymen , who are far more euroskeptic than the germans . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : dishonest at heart france 's decision to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has ignited debate over a similar vote in germany .

while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives . three quarters of german voters say they want the chance to vote on the eu constitution , despite the fact that their country 's own constitution does not allow for such referendums .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition of social democrats and greens are not easily persuaded by popular demands .
the conservative opposition is also not completely unanimous in supporting a referendum .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
but her colleague edmund stoiber from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- has come out strong in favor of the issue .
a change in german law such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , stoiber has said .
on sunday he called on all eu heads of state and government to agree on a european-wide referendum on the constitution .
in germany , he has suggested that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes .
stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution .
changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the parliament , the bundestag , and the bundesrat , which represents state interests .
stoiber cautioned that referendums should only be called for when essential changes are introduced to the constitutional basis of the eu .
liberal and green support in an uncanny turn of alliances , the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats party have joined forces in supporting the introduction of new legislation to allow for national referendums .
only a few days ago the fdp announced that it would introduce legislation in september calling for a referendum on the eu constitution .
speaking with the newsmagazine der spiegel , fdp leader guido westerwelle said he had written to other parties asking that the issue be put to a free vote in parliament .
" if we could agree to that , a two-thirds majority is feasible , " he was quoted as saying .

lance armstrong broke all records to become the first six-time winner of the tour de france on sunday .
as in years past , a german stood next to him on the podium , but it was not jan ullrich . going into the 20th and final stage of the tour de france , there were no doubts about who would stand atop the winner 's podium in paris on sunday .
lance armstrong , having won the world 's most prestigious cycling race five times before , was the obvious winner long before the first racers passed the finish line on the champs elysees .
the 32-year-old american was in prime form for this year 's competition .
even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "
sprinting ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now six-time tour de france winner lance armstrong flanked by second-placed andreas klöden of germany -lrb- left -rrb- and third-placed ivan basso of italy .
in this year 's tour , klöden came close to beating armstrong in a sprint to the line during the 17th stage from bourg-d 'oisans to le grand bornard .
he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .
" i am totally proud , " klöden said basking in the winner 's champagne .
" it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to stand here on the podium . " dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is ullrich 's tour already over ?
jan ullrich 's hopes of winning the tour de france took a blow this weekend after the german failed to keep pace with defending champion lance armstrong in the first mountain stages .
-lrb- july 17 , 2004 -rrb- tour de france is a financial tour de force the tour de france attracts over 15 million spectators to the streets with a further billion happy to watch at home .
no wonder it 's become one of the sporting world 's biggest businesses .

even the dreaded six-time victory curse , which had prevented previous record holders jacques anquetil , eddy merckx , bernard hinault and miguel indurain from making history , could n't keep him from pedaling ahead of the pack for five stage victories and the overall title .
with armstrong so definitively ahead of the rivals in points , the real competition came down to the second-place finish .
as in the past five years , it was a german who trailed armstrong .
but it was n't the perennial jan ullrich , who finished sixth overall this year .
instead , andreas klöden , ullrich 's t-mobile teammate , stood next to armstrong in the winner 's circle .
a new german second bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 29-year-old andreas klöden is germany 's new cycling hero .
after turning in a strong performance in the final time trial on saturday to snatch the runner-up place away from the widely favored italian ivan basso , klöden held his position along the 163-kilometer stretch from montereau to paris .
although he finished 38th on sunday , it was still enough to guarantee him the overall second-place standing .
klöden , who earned bronze at the sydney olympics in 2000 and won the prestigious paris-nice race that same year , alerting the cycling world to his potential , has been an unreliable rider in recent years .
in 2001 he finished 26th in the tour de france and did not take part in it the following year .
he abandoned the race in 2003 , only to come back to the team this year .
" we know that andreas is talented , " said his t-mobile team manager , walter godefroot .
" but we also know he is fragile .
in 2000 , he had health problems , injured his knee and back .
but talent is talent and we kept faith in him . "

he came in third on the 16th stage time trial up l 'alpe d 'huez , behind ullrich and winner armstrong .
on saturday 's 19th stage time trial he started out 62 seconds behind basso , but was able to pull out ahead .
" his best quality is that he 's a really smooth roller , " said godefroot .
" he 's fast in the mountains and on the flats , even if he lacks a bit of strength . "
in the end , klöden trailed armstrong by over six minutes and was just 20 seconds ahead of basso .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .

he has told sudanese officials that germany would withhold all further aid unless the government acts to resolve the crisis .
eu issues cautious warning the netherlands , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , gave sudan a cautious warning to stick to commitments to disarm the janjaweed arab militias accused of pursuing a scorched earth policy that the us congress has labeled genocide .

germany and the us agreed to keep up pressure on sudan on the eve of a meeting in which european ministers will discuss the humanitarian crisis in the western darfur region . german foreign minister joschka fischer on sunday agreed in a telephone conversation with us secretary of state colin powell that the international community must continue applying pressure to sudan 's government to end the conflict in the impoverished region , where some 30,000 people have been killed and many more forced to flee .
according to a statement from the german foreign ministry , they decided " sanctions will be unavoidable if the government does not meet its self-set commitments in dafur . "
in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf , fischer said a us-drafted un resolution threatening sanctions was one way to force khartoum to stop the violence .
un security council members china and russia , however , have held back the resolution because they object to the threat of sanctions .
strong words although france , one of two eu members on the security council , has been hesitant to adopt more forceful tactics , britain has signaled its willingness to step up the pressure on khartoum .
a top british military commander has said he could muster 5,000 troops for a darfur mission if it becomes necessary .
prime minister tony blair has not ruled out military intervention .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .

interior minister otto schily supports the proposal , which london had put forth in previous eu meetings as a solution for dealing with the growing number of illegal immigrants who leave north africa on rickety boats bound for european shores .
the idea is to stop the would-be refugees before they leave home and to involve the countries of departure in the process of countering illegal immigration .

since joining the eu , malta has become the first port of call for african refugees heading to europe .
but the island has a poor record of dealing with illegal immigrants and human rights officials are concerned . for the small mediterranean island and its 400,000 inhabitants , the yearly influx of immigrants is a huge challenge .
unable to deal with the boatloads of africans washing up on its shores , malta sends many back home .
a few of the lucky ones receive refugee status , while the rest remain in detention centers , their fate uncertain .
in 2002 , malta experienced its largest wave of illegal immigrants when some 1,700 people landed on the island , the first european harbor on the route between africa and the northern el dorado of the eu .
although the numbers arriving since then have declined , the country still has difficulty coping with the many asylum seekers .
since becoming a member of the european union in may , malta has come into the spotlight of human rights organizations , who are concerned the country is overwhelmed by the problem .
a report published earlier this year by the council of europe 's commission for human rights focused on the situation in malta and vehemently criticized the way the government treats illegal immigrants .
inhumane detention centers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of malta 's illegal immigrants will never see the island outside the detention centers .
would-be asylum seekers are detained in sealed-off holding centers in reputedly deplorable conditions .
at hal safi , for instance , the rooms are dark , filthy and overpopulated .
ten men share a room ; there is no privacy , and the detainees can only go outside for fresh air once a day in a muddy field surrounded by barbed wire .
the illegal immigrants - many who were on their way to italy from north africa - are trapped in malta , say european human rights experts who criticize the systematic detainment .
but according to the country 's interior minister , tonio borg , the detention is justified .
it 's necessary because of national interest .
what one has to understand is that we are 313 square miles in size with 1,200 inhabitants per square mile .
so we need special measures , " he says .
alvaro gil-robles , the council of europe 's commissioner for human rights , argues that malta 's detention policy is inhumane .
" the asylum seeker is someone who is escaping human rights violations , who is in distress and who needs help , " gil-robles says .
" systematic detention can not be justified , " he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbors abound in malta , but few immigrants are welcome .
arnold cassola , secretary-general of the european greens , refers to the systematic detention of refugees as an obvious human rights violation : " you can not keep even an animal cooped up in an area where you have no space , no social life , where you can just walk up and down - human beings need to exercise their mind and not be treated as if they have killed or stolen when they have n't . "
psychological distress most of the illegal immigrants are held in detention for over a year .
their applications for asylum have been turned down as have their appeals .
many detainees suffer from extreme frustration which often leads to depression .
more than a dozen have had to undergo psychiatric treatment .
one of the detainees , george brown from liberia , describes the situation to deutsche welle : " the situation in the camp is deadly .
since we entered here we ’ ve been suffering .
we ’ ve been neglected , humiliated .
they treat us like criminals here .
we don ’ t know our fate in this place .
we ’ re locked up , can ’ t go outside .
we don ’ t have any rights in this place .
we ’ re more or less like prisoners - though we did not commit any crime , " brown said .
even prisons are better only a few non-government organizations have access to the detention centers .
one of them is the catholic group peace lab , whose volunteers visit the immigrants and provide them with newspapers and drawing material .
the socialist parliamentarian joe abela has been to the camps and says that the situation - although still alarming - has improved somewhat since the publication of the gil-robles report .
he says the detention centers are still overcrowded with just four showers and toilets for over 80 people .
" there is no privacy .
it 's cold in winter and extremely hot in summer .
it 's just terrible , " he says describing hal safi .
the situation in the detention centers is even more shocking when compared to the conditions found in maltese prisons , says gil-robles : " prisons are in good conditions .
the prisons have activities for the detainees and people take care of them .
generally speaking conditions in the prisons are much better than those in the detention camps . " # b # there 's another difference too : when a prisoner 's sentence is done , he is free to leave .
the illegal immigrants in malta 's detention centers , however , do not know how long they will have to wait .
months , years - their fate is uncertain . barbara gruber -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's invisible walls illegal immigrants attempt to cross the mediterranean sea at a higher risk than ever before .

mohammad reza aghdam ahmadi was cleared of killing photographer zahra kazemi , who died in custody in iran last year .
zahra kazemi 's son , stephan hachemi said the trial was a " cover-up " to divert attention from the real killer .
mr hachemi and his supporters are urging canada to bring iran before the international court in the hague .
mrs kazemi was arrested last june after taking pictures outside a prison in the capital , tehran .
she died in hospital in tehran on 10 july after falling into a coma , having received head injuries during more than three days of interrogation .
' semi-intentional murder ' ms kazemi 's family has previously said a high-ranking official of the justice department struck the fatal blow , and that the court was putting someone else on trial to protect the real killer . "
it 's a cover-up .
they 're not ready to implicate iranian officials .
i have only three letters - icj - the international court of justice " stephan hachemi iran refused to allow canadian diplomats to attend the closed-door hearing where mr ahmadi was accused of " semi-intentional murder " .
the bbc 's miranda eeles in tehran says lawyers acting for the kazemi family say they now have 20 days to appeal .
they are calling for the judiciary to appoint a new investigator to look into the case and for the trial to take place at a provincial court , our correspondent says .
mr hachemi said : " it 's a cover-up .

blood money the bbc 's lee carter , in toronto , says there has been very little official canadian government reaction to the court ruling - it says it wants to study the verdict further .
the case soured relations between iran and canada and ottawa recalled its ambassador in protest .
the case also deepened the rift between iran 's reformist government and the hardline judiciary , with both sides accusing the other of a cover-up .
reformist president mohammad khatami said he believed mr ahmadi was innocent and called on the judiciary to identify " the real guilty person " .
irna news agency quoted a justice department source as saying ms kazemi 's blood money - a sum given to the family of the victim by the murderer - will be paid for by the state treasury .
lawyers for the family said the family would reject financial compensation if iran offered any .

researchers are packing more and more into silicon chips the more transistors can fit on a chip , the more processing power a computer has .
the closer together the transistors are , the quicker they can transfer signals between them , and so the faster they run .
and researchers have been squeezing more and more onto chips at a pretty constant rate .
in 1965 gordon moore , co-founder of chip giant intel , stated that the number of transistors on a chip will continue to double every 18-24 months .
in the next 40 years , transistor counts went from 2,300 to 55 million , as moore 's law continued to hold true .
" in many respects we 're still in the infancy of microprocessors , " said gordon moore .
" there are many things we can do to make them more capable and we 're pushing those as hard as we can . "
light technology today , japan 's earth simulator is the world 's fastest supercomputer , tearing along at over 35 million million calculations a second .
but how did we get here ?
how has something so powerful been made to fit into such a relatively small box ?
it 's got to the stage where you ca n't use all of the chip at the same time , you have to use parts of it at a time to keep heat down to a minimum dr dave watson , ibm in a process called lithography , circuits are etched onto silicon by shining light through a mask .
as we learn to use shorter wavelengths of light , we can make finer and finer circuits .
" there are difficulties in continuing to refine the current lithography process indefinitely and people are moving towards different wavelengths of light , moving away from visible light into what 's called extreme ultraviolet , " explained dr dave watson from ibm .
" that offers the opportunity to use a shorter and shorter wavelength , which allows you to etch smaller and smaller components into integrated circuits . "
even if you could keep refining the lithography process , there are other problems associated with bringing things really close together - chips are getting hot .
" chips use more power to create heat in themselves than they actually do to work , and that 's because of the density of components on the chip , " said dr watson .
" it 's got to the stage where you ca n't use all of the chip at the same time , you have to use parts of it at a time to keep heat down to a minimum .
" if you look at current chip technology , the actual core component in the chip can only be about 25 atomic layers thick of silicon , and the problem is that you get jumps of electricity between different components .
" so you have two copper conductors separated by 25 atomic layers and the electrons can literally jump from one side to the other and you get shorts in chips , " he explained .
" if you go much smaller you simply can not control the electrons within the chip . "
quantum leap developers have encountered barriers like this before , but moore 's law has always found a way around them .
the change from aluminium to copper as the conductor in chips meant they could use 30 % less power .
newer , more expensive chips made from gallium arsenide instead of silicon could prove 40 % faster .
moore : famous for his prediction about processing power but even if you can overcome the heat , power and materials problems , you can not just go on shrinking forever .
it is estimated that sometime in the next decade , moore 's law will reach its final , impenetrable barrier - you can not make a wire thinner than an atom .
if , by the time we reach the atom barrier , we still want more oomph in our machines , scientists will have to do things differently .
at oxford university , under an electron microscope , there are the hazy beginnings of a very different type of computer - a quantum computer .
in such a computer , data is processed by exploiting the strange qualities of quantum physics and the building blocks of computation are not transistors but caged atoms or qubits .
" the difference between quantum computing and classical computing is that whereas in a classical computer you work with bits that at any given moment can be either 1 or 0 , in a quantum computer we use what we call qubits , and i know it sounds weird but each qubit can be both 1 and 0 at the same time , " said andrew briggs , professor of nanomaterials at the university of oxford .
" the benefit that brings you is that in a quantum computer you can try different solutions to a problem simultaneously . "
an array of qubits is made by lining up rows of caged atoms .
instead of having to work out the answer to a problem , an array of qubits will come up with all possible answers in far fewer steps that a conventional computer forced to rely on classical physics .
a quantum computer may not be needed for word processing and answering e-mails .
but there are some jobs which may require more power than moore 's law could ever provide , so it is good to know that one day that law could be broken .

the closer together the transistors are , the quicker they can transfer signals between them , and so the faster they run .
and researchers have been squeezing more and more onto chips at a pretty constant rate .
in 1965 gordon moore , co-founder of chip giant intel , stated that the number of transistors on a chip will continue to double every 18-24 months .
in the next 40 years , transistor counts went from 2,300 to 55 million , as moore 's law continued to hold true .
" in many respects we 're still in the infancy of microprocessors , " said gordon moore .
" there are many things we can do to make them more capable and we 're pushing those as hard as we can . "
light technology today , japan 's earth simulator is the world 's fastest supercomputer , tearing along at over 35 million million calculations a second .
but how did we get here ?
how has something so powerful been made to fit into such a relatively small box ?
it 's got to the stage where you ca n't use all of the chip at the same time , you have to use parts of it at a time to keep heat down to a minimum dr dave watson , ibm in a process called lithography , circuits are etched onto silicon by shining light through a mask .
as we learn to use shorter wavelengths of light , we can make finer and finer circuits .
" there are difficulties in continuing to refine the current lithography process indefinitely and people are moving towards different wavelengths of light , moving away from visible light into what 's called extreme ultraviolet , " explained dr dave watson from ibm .
" that offers the opportunity to use a shorter and shorter wavelength , which allows you to etch smaller and smaller components into integrated circuits . "
even if you could keep refining the lithography process , there are other problems associated with bringing things really close together - chips are getting hot .
" chips use more power to create heat in themselves than they actually do to work , and that 's because of the density of components on the chip , " said dr watson .
" it 's got to the stage where you ca n't use all of the chip at the same time , you have to use parts of it at a time to keep heat down to a minimum .
" if you look at current chip technology , the actual core component in the chip can only be about 25 atomic layers thick of silicon , and the problem is that you get jumps of electricity between different components .
" so you have two copper conductors separated by 25 atomic layers and the electrons can literally jump from one side to the other and you get shorts in chips , " he explained .
" if you go much smaller you simply can not control the electrons within the chip . "
quantum leap developers have encountered barriers like this before , but moore 's law has always found a way around them .
the change from aluminium to copper as the conductor in chips meant they could use 30 % less power .
newer , more expensive chips made from gallium arsenide instead of silicon could prove 40 % faster .
moore : famous for his prediction about processing power but even if you can overcome the heat , power and materials problems , you can not just go on shrinking forever .
it is estimated that sometime in the next decade , moore 's law will reach its final , impenetrable barrier - you can not make a wire thinner than an atom .
if , by the time we reach the atom barrier , we still want more oomph in our machines , scientists will have to do things differently .
at oxford university , under an electron microscope , there are the hazy beginnings of a very different type of computer - a quantum computer .
in such a computer , data is processed by exploiting the strange qualities of quantum physics and the building blocks of computation are not transistors but caged atoms or qubits .
" the difference between quantum computing and classical computing is that whereas in a classical computer you work with bits that at any given moment can be either 1 or 0 , in a quantum computer we use what we call qubits , and i know it sounds weird but each qubit can be both 1 and 0 at the same time , " said andrew briggs , professor of nanomaterials at the university of oxford .
" the benefit that brings you is that in a quantum computer you can try different solutions to a problem simultaneously . "
an array of qubits is made by lining up rows of caged atoms .
instead of having to work out the answer to a problem , an array of qubits will come up with all possible answers in far fewer steps that a conventional computer forced to rely on classical physics .
a quantum computer may not be needed for word processing and answering e-mails .
but there are some jobs which may require more power than moore 's law could ever provide , so it is good to know that one day that law could be broken .

researchers are packing more and more into silicon chips the more transistors can fit on a chip , the more processing power a computer has .
the closer together the transistors are , the quicker they can transfer signals between them , and so the faster they run .
and researchers have been squeezing more and more onto chips at a pretty constant rate .
in 1965 gordon moore , co-founder of chip giant intel , stated that the number of transistors on a chip will continue to double every 18-24 months .
in the next 40 years , transistor counts went from 2,300 to 55 million , as moore 's law continued to hold true .
" in many respects we 're still in the infancy of microprocessors , " said gordon moore .
" there are many things we can do to make them more capable and we 're pushing those as hard as we can . "
light technology today , japan 's earth simulator is the world 's fastest supercomputer , tearing along at over 35 million million calculations a second .
but how did we get here ?
how has something so powerful been made to fit into such a relatively small box ?
it 's got to the stage where you ca n't use all of the chip at the same time , you have to use parts of it at a time to keep heat down to a minimum dr dave watson , ibm in a process called lithography , circuits are etched onto silicon by shining light through a mask .
as we learn to use shorter wavelengths of light , we can make finer and finer circuits .
" there are difficulties in continuing to refine the current lithography process indefinitely and people are moving towards different wavelengths of light , moving away from visible light into what 's called extreme ultraviolet , " explained dr dave watson from ibm .
" that offers the opportunity to use a shorter and shorter wavelength , which allows you to etch smaller and smaller components into integrated circuits . "
even if you could keep refining the lithography process , there are other problems associated with bringing things really close together - chips are getting hot .
" chips use more power to create heat in themselves than they actually do to work , and that 's because of the density of components on the chip , " said dr watson .
" it 's got to the stage where you ca n't use all of the chip at the same time , you have to use parts of it at a time to keep heat down to a minimum .
" if you look at current chip technology , the actual core component in the chip can only be about 25 atomic layers thick of silicon , and the problem is that you get jumps of electricity between different components .
" so you have two copper conductors separated by 25 atomic layers and the electrons can literally jump from one side to the other and you get shorts in chips , " he explained .
" if you go much smaller you simply can not control the electrons within the chip . "
quantum leap developers have encountered barriers like this before , but moore 's law has always found a way around them .
the change from aluminium to copper as the conductor in chips meant they could use 30 % less power .
newer , more expensive chips made from gallium arsenide instead of silicon could prove 40 % faster .
moore : famous for his prediction about processing power but even if you can overcome the heat , power and materials problems , you can not just go on shrinking forever .
it is estimated that sometime in the next decade , moore 's law will reach its final , impenetrable barrier - you can not make a wire thinner than an atom .
if , by the time we reach the atom barrier , we still want more oomph in our machines , scientists will have to do things differently .
at oxford university , under an electron microscope , there are the hazy beginnings of a very different type of computer - a quantum computer .
in such a computer , data is processed by exploiting the strange qualities of quantum physics and the building blocks of computation are not transistors but caged atoms or qubits .
" the difference between quantum computing and classical computing is that whereas in a classical computer you work with bits that at any given moment can be either 1 or 0 , in a quantum computer we use what we call qubits , and i know it sounds weird but each qubit can be both 1 and 0 at the same time , " said andrew briggs , professor of nanomaterials at the university of oxford .
" the benefit that brings you is that in a quantum computer you can try different solutions to a problem simultaneously . "
an array of qubits is made by lining up rows of caged atoms .
instead of having to work out the answer to a problem , an array of qubits will come up with all possible answers in far fewer steps that a conventional computer forced to rely on classical physics .
a quantum computer may not be needed for word processing and answering e-mails .
but there are some jobs which may require more power than moore 's law could ever provide , so it is good to know that one day that law could be broken .

here they react to the findings of the 9/11 commission .
rhonda buie : san diego , california " homeland security is not a buzz phrase to win votes " jim hill : sudbury , mass .
" kerry has failed to secure this country " neil sherman : germantown , tenn .
" bush has a better handle on security than kerry " jorge caspary : tallahassee , florida " adequate steps have been taken to protect us " nancy pew : seattle , washington " we should not have our freedoms limited " corey harrison : chicago , illinois " bush 's re-election chances rely heavily on fear " rhonda buie although i was pleased with the commission 's findings , the results do not affect my voting decision .
meet the panel name : rhonda buie age : 23 lives : san diego , california works : student current voting intention : democrat in 10 words or less : " wife , student , amateur artist , imperfect and independent observer " all three candidates have their pros and cons , so voting is really a decision of which one i would be happiest with .
i still plan to vote for kerry , as i feel bush is not considering fully his responsibilities and actions , and unfortunately , nader has little chance of actually making the presidency due to the fact he 's not in one of the top two parties .
concerning safety , i feel the same as i have ever felt .
i can not say if any of the suggestions given in the commission 's report will be heeded , and it 's starting to look as if the security precautions laid out after 9/11 are becoming lax .
our panel : where they live enlarge map we are back to our preoccupations , and our leaders are back to their politics .
homeland security is as important to me as any other issue .
our next president must be actively involved in the process of maintaining that security .
it is vital that the candidates understand that homeland security is not a buzz phrase to win votes and approval , but a very real and active issue .
return to the top your comments : i am extremely tired of the bi-polar party system in the united states .
bush has made a show of the 9/11 attacks and wants to get re-elected for another four years .
four-hundred thousand dollars and sitting at the helm of power is quite a draw .
troy banther , portales , usa i completely agree .
this is not an issue for politicos to use to attract swing voters .
george bush has already capitalized on our fear of another attack , yet he has shown little -lrb- if anything -rrb- in the way of action toward preventing another one .
invading iraq only incited more recruitment .
the afghanistan campaign is failing miserably .
and now he 's trying to convince us he 's a man of peace ? !
give us a break , george .
eric andrade , new york , usa the commission findings indicate that those responsible for maintaining homeland security failed miserably and their ineffectiveness caused the death of almost 3,000 americans .
there is no justification for this situation in a society that boasts of its efficiency above the rest of the world .
luis perez , panama city , panama " wife , student , amateur artist , imperfect and independent observer " .
sounds like you have a lot on your mind .
homeland security is not just a political slogan .
the issue is so important to us that we created entire department as well as political dialog .
few years ago you could n't even express you opinion on this subject because the subject despite its existence was totally ignored .
ironically , the people who are protecting you and me are the once you resent the most .
greg , chicago just because you do not feel nader can win does not mean you should not vote for him .
there is no better way of saying " i am fed up with the current politics " then to vote for someone who does not partake in them .
