six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .

all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .

in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2004 germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stability pact was designed to protect the value of the euro .
according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .

world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "

for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .

the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .

berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2004 germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stability pact was designed to protect the value of the euro .
according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 27.04.2004 is germany missing the eu boat with tough work rules ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany builds a temporary wall around its labor market with europe 's borders moving east , germany wants to create new ones by restricting the influx of workers from the new member states .
but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2004 german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite strong exports , germany 's economy is slow to recover .
six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .

" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2004 -pipe- 08:00 utc eu and u.s. quarrel over visa arrangements reacting to media reports that countries such as poland and the czech republic will press for the visa arrangement to be extended to all 25 member states , u.s. under-secretary for border security asa hutchinson said assessment would be made on a " country-by-country " basis .
" we do not take a bloc of countries because they are members of the eu , " hutchinson said .
at the moment all current member states apart from greece have a visa waiver , while only slovenia from the new member states has met the u.s. criteria .
the u.s. judges countries on the basis of their rate of visa denials and their record of dealing with stolen passports .
but there are fears that new member states , unlike greece , will not hold back from using a so-called solidarity clause , which is part of the schengen -lrb- open borders -rrb- legislation .
this clause , once invoked , would mean that all eu member states would be obliged to require visas from u.s. citizens .
some new member states , particularly poland , which was a firm ally of washington during the iraq war , are irritated that their citizens have to apply for visas to go to the united states .
a commission spokesperson said the brussels executive would rather negotiate with washington so that all 10 new member states can join the visa waiver in 2006 - the year when they are due to open their borders in the eu , as well .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2004 germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stability pact was designed to protect the value of the euro .
according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2004 germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stability pact was designed to protect the value of the euro .
according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .

a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? europe -pipe- 27.04.2004 is germany missing the eu boat with tough work rules ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany builds a temporary wall around its labor market with europe 's borders moving east , germany wants to create new ones by restricting the influx of workers from the new member states .
but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2004 germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stability pact was designed to protect the value of the euro .
according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.04.2004 germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stability pact was designed to protect the value of the euro .
according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .
" the experience of the last year has shown that something must be changed , " he said but stopped short of calling for a lifting of the three percent limit . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone ministers break stability pact finance ministers from the 12 member euro zone agreed by majority on tuesday to suspend disciplinary action against germany and france for failing to reign in their budget deficits below the three percent gdp limit .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 . in their traditional spring report , germany 's leading economic think-tanks said that " the german recovery will only gradually gain momentum in 2004 , and in 2005 the pace of economic growth will not increase further . "
in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .

but experts say the rules may mean germany is turning away immigrants it needs . among the current european union member states , germany and austria have been the loudest opponents of allowing the mostly citizens of the new eu member states , mostly in eastern europe , from migrating to the west and taking jobs there after may 1 .
the move is intended to assuage fears of workers and unions in germany that the weak domestic labor market , already saddled with high unemployment , could be further destabilized by an onslaught of cheap labor from the east .
" on the border with the czech republic , there 's currently an enormous wage and price differential , " thomas koller , head of the chamber of trades in the upper frankonia region of bavaria , told dw-world .
" if we allowed immediate free movement of trade , we 'd be put under enormous pressure to adjust in ways that we 're not ready for . "
pressure for builders and skilled trades although eastward expansion is expected to bring with it new trade opportunities , in blue-collar areas like skilled labor or construction , it is likely to put downward wage pressures on western european workers - especially in border countries like germany or austria .
it 's no secret that trade groups are trying to buy as much time as possible .
" we could increase our productivity , our capacity for innovation and our quality , " koller said , " but our companies would n't have any chance against lower prices -lrb- from the east -rrb- . "
under pressure from berlin , the european commission permitted existing eu members to impose restrictions on the movement of labor from the new member states as part of expansion negotiations .
the rules can apply for a maximum of seven years . the final deal bore the approval stamp of the 28 regional chambers of trade in german border areas who banded together to form the " arge 28 " interest group .
under the agreement , current eu members have been granted permission to set their own timetables in that period for opening up their labor markets .
but the commission also reserves the right to review the restrictions on a country-by-country basis and lift them if it sees fit .
" the countries that want to take advantage of the full transition period also have to give reasons for doing so , " a spokesman for the european commission 's representation in germany told dw-world . ireland , britain open borders while ireland and the united kingdom have said they will open their borders immediately after accession , they are the only ones .
all the other 13 eu states have expressed a desire to impose some sort of restrictions on new eu citizens , although if they will actually do so is unclear .
even ireland and the uk plan on requiring that foreigners live there at least two years before they can qualify for welfare programs .
taken in perspective , the figures for the expected influx of immigrants from the east are relatively modest .
a recent study on european migration found that between 700,000 and 900,000 people are expected to migrate to the existing eu countries , including a large number of skilled workers .
" the smart people wo n't wait until the transition periods have past .
they 'll just go to other countries like the united states or australia where they are welcomed .
this potential would then be lost for germany , " said rainer münz , a professor of demography at berlin 's humboldt university , who is the author of the study and a handful of books on european migration .
in the long-term , however , münz said he did n't expect any major wave of migration to occur .
during the next 30 years , he said he predicts close to 4 million people from the new member states will migrate .
" that 's not a large number , " he said .
eastern europe faces own graying population by closing its doors during the early days of migration , germany could be missing out on an opportunity that has a very limited shelf life , since many of the new member states suffer from the same graying population that is putting pressure on germany 's social welfare system .
ten years down the road , he said , when germany has become reliant on immigrants because of its own demographic problems , the eastern european countries wo n't have much left to offer .
" at that point , these countries , which will also be dealing with the over-aging of their populations , will also be fighting for immigrants , " münz said .
experts have chalked germany 's decision up to domestic political considerations that wo n't provide the best solution over the medium or long term , when berlin will be struggling to find solutions to keep its lavish social system humming along in the face of a falling birth rate . to others , the argument was simple : without the restrictions , criticism among the german public about the eu 's eastward expansion might have been greater than it was . steffen leidel -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new europe return to dw-world 's eu expansion special report .

in real terms , the increase in german gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would be 1.5 percent for this year and next , the institutes predicted .
that puts germany at the low end in the 12-country euro zone , where the average growth is expected to be 1.6 percent in 2004 and 2.0 percent in 2005 .
the new forecasts reflect a downward revision from the institutes ' previous report published last fall , when they had been calculating a growth of 1.7 percent for this year .
" the german economy is slowly emerging from stagnation , " the report stated at the time .
in the first few months of 2004 , output and demand were on the increase again , " albeit at a slow pace , " the spring report acknowledged .
" the german economy is still sleepy , " said gustav horn of the berlin-based diw institute for economic research on tuesday .
world growth triggers german recovery the six institutes referred to the strong euro as one factor behind germany 's recovery , but largely regarded a general improvement in the world economy as responsible for the 2004 upturn .
" despite the marked appreciation of the euro , impulses for recovery came from the vigorous economic development in the rest of the world economy , " they observed .
" in addition , the level of uncertainty has declined , partly due to the end of the iraq war , so that the expansionary stance of monetary policy is increasingly having effects on the german economy , as well as on the rest of the euro area , " the experts wrote .
however , the think-tanks cautioned that the negative effects of the strong euro were " still prevalent " and would " lessen the impact of the economic upswing outside the euro area . "
but as long as the dollar does not continue to fall , " this factor will lose some of its importance in the latter part of 2004 . "
unemployment still high despite the gradual economic recovery , the institutes foresaw only minimal progress in reducing the jobless rate .
they predicted that the total number of people out of work in germany would average 4.332 million in 2004 compared with 4.376 million last year .
for 2005 they predicted only a marginal drop to 4.276 million people .
such figures put germany 's unemployment rate of 10.2 percent for 2004 much higher than the euro zone average of 8.8 percent , and serve as a further weight slowing down economic growth .
deficit stays above 3.0 percent in terms of germany 's public finances , the institutes indicated there was little sign of progress in pulling the country out of its budget deficit .
the report said that the germany public deficit , which already amounted to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2002 and 3.9 percent in 2003 , would once again violate the 3.0 percent ceiling laid down in the european stability and growth pact for the third and fourth year running .
the experts predicted a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in 2005 .
such forecasts clearly contradict berlin 's pledges to bring the deficit back below 3.0 percent next year , and will most likely trigger a harsh response from brussels which already threatened to punish germany last year for failing to reign in its soaring deficit . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de businesses predict economic growth in 2004 an autumn survey of 25,000 companies released on monday offers optimistic economic news : germany may be recovering from a three-year slump .

according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year . on tuesday , germany 's leading economic think tanks released a report that could burst berlin 's budgetary bubble and draw criticism from brussels .
according to the annual spring economic forecast , the country 's top six economic research institutes predict that the deficit ratio would remain far in excess of the ceiling set by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
under the terms of the 1997 budgetary guidelines , drawn up at the behest of germany itself as a means to stabilize the euro and ensure weaker economies do n't pull the region down , euro zone members are prohibited from running up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
germany , however , already violated the rules in 2002 and 2003 , when its deficit soared to 3.5 percent and 3.9 percent respectively .
since being admonished by brussels and threatened with sharp financial penalties , berlin has pledged to reign in its spending and bring the deficit down to under the three-percent mark by 2005 .
broken promises ?
but the six economic forecasters are predicting a different picture .
they are penciling in a deficit ratio of 3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent the year after .
" this implies that the upper limit stipulated in the stability and growth pact will be exceeded for the fourth consecutive year in 2005 , " tuesday 's report stated .
a failure to lower its deficit would mean berlin would break its pledge to its european partners and once again send a message to brussels that the euro zone 's largest economy is incapable of budgetary discipline .
in addition to breaking promises , the poor prospects for germany 's public finances are likely to re-ignite the debate about the relevance of the unpopular stability pact .
the credibility of the budget rules suffered a heavy blow last year when eu members decided not to sanction france and germany even though the two countries ' deficits violated the pact .
berlin and paris were effectively let off the hook in return for pledges to get their finances in order by 2005 .
questioning the stability pact the move triggered an eu crisis , pitting smaller euro zone countries , who had consistently tightened their belts to correspond to the budget guidelines , against the bigger " budgetary sinners " like france and germany who repeatedly flaunted the rules .
the member states ' decision to waiver the penalties also antagonized the eu commission , who wanted to make an example out of the two deficit violators .
the commission subsequently filed a lawsuit against the member states for failing to adhere to its executive ruling .
on april 28 , the european court of justice in luxembourg will begin hearing the case .
the news of germany 's likely repeat breach of the pact in 2005 has brought the entire nature of the pact into question and have left some calling for a revamping to enable it to take into account more of the ups and downs of the economic cycle .
the new eu commissioner for monetary affairs , joaquin almunia , on tuesday called for a re-evaluation of the stability pact and a possible , albeit careful , reform .

donald anderson mp , told bbc 2 's newsnight programme that tony blair did not support israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's plan to unilaterally disengage with the palestinians as president george w bush has done .
newsnight 's political correspondent martha kearney , has said that government sources have dismissed the ex-diplomats as the ' camel corps ' - officials previously based in arab countries who have gone native .
william fullerton , who was uk ambassador to kuwait from 1992-96 , said on the programme : " in my mind we seem to be following america 's interests tamely and the us neo-conservatives view of the middle east is unrealistic . "
differences former uk ambassador to libya oliver miles , one of the signatories , said the letter was prompted after the prime minister agreed with the president that israeli settlements in the west bank were now considered as acceptable .
" this is a departure from the principles on which any negotiated settlement is likely to be reached .
" one has not come away with the impression that there is a gap between the british and the americans on these matters , " he said .
mr anderson said that the diplomats ' letter has not accurately reflected what the prime minister said on the arab-israeli conflict , following his washington summit with the president .
" there was no endorsement of what the president called the realities on the ground or targeted killings , there was a greater emphasis on the united nations .
" there has been no acceptance of the legality of the security fence built on the occupied territories .

but the new spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , does not find the situation very funny .
he recently described spain 's domestic violence record as the country 's " worst shame " and an " unacceptable evil " .
on friday his government made a draft " gender violence " law the very first of the not even week-old administration .
it aims to bring new domestic violence legislation before parliament by the summer .
at least one woman dies every week in spain at the hands of her partner .
thousands stay in abusive relationships because , they say , there is nowhere else to go .
sadly , these figures are not uncommon in europe .
but there is a growing awareness here of the problem .
democracy in spain is only 25-years-old .
before that , during the 40-year-long dictatorship of general francisco franco , domestic violence was not considered a crime .
what it was , though , was taboo .
there is a spanish phrase , using the feminine article that says : " i broke it because it was mine " .
this attitude towards women is now changing fast , especially among the young .
the spanish oscars , the goyas , were won this year by a popular film called i give you my eyes , about domestic violence .
cases of domestic abuse feature on the evening news almost daily and spain 's tv chat shows , which are on morning , noon and night , regularly discuss the issue .
public sentiment earlier this year , roman catholic bishops caused an outcry with a report suggesting that sexual liberation since the 1960s had led to more men beating their wives .
although the majority of spaniards still describe themselves as catholic , church attendance levels are dwindling .
so mr zapatero was certainly tapping into public sentiment when , just a few hours after being sworn in as spain 's new premier , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the 11 march train attacks who were on the same ward .
but it would be unfair to suggest that the previous conservative government ignored spain 's growing domestic violence figures .
the problem appears to be the implementation of the laws it passed , such as the enforcement of restraining orders , for example .
this is something the new government wants to improve .
women here have also complained that the spanish judiciary is ruled by conservative , older men who , they say , often rule against women 's interests .
and there is a growing demand for treatment programmes for the abusers .
at the moment there are only two institutes in spain that work with violent men to try to change their behaviour .
women 's image according to the new spanish government the country 's problem is a wider one , concerning not just the way abusers treat women but the image of women in spanish society in general .
the spanish minister for work and social affairs , jesus caldera , says spain needs a general " change in behaviour towards women " , which should be impressed upon school children through the study of " ethics and equality " .
he has called for a debate on the way women are portrayed in spanish advertisements and has announced the government 's intention to break women 's " chains of dependence " on their male counterparts by improving employment and housing provisions for women .
mr zapatero has promised to make equality between the sexes " an emblematic task " .
and where better to start than within his own cabinet ?
eight of the 16 posts are occupied by women , including spain 's first ever female deputy prime minister .
mr zapatero says his government will initiate a system of tax and other incentives to encourage spanish businesses to employ more women , especially at managerial level .
at the moment the proportion of women on boards of directors does not reach 10 % - and is less than 2 % in the biggest companies on the spanish stock exchange .
the government wants to ensure sexual equality from the lowest to the highest echelons of spanish society .
royal reform it has proposed changing the constitution as regards the succession to the spanish throne , where men are favoured over women .
any new legislation would not come into effect until the next generation , however .
spain 's prince felipe will become king after his father , even though he has two older sisters .
other proposed changes in gender legislation include the official recognition of homosexual partnerships -lrb- 68 % of spaniards said in a gallup poll last year that they were in favour of gay marriages -rrb- , and debating the rights of gay couples to adopt children .
mr zapatero also intends to alter radically spain 's abortion laws which , he says , are completely outdated .
abortion in spain is illegal except in three cases : if a woman has a deformed foetus , if she has been raped or if her physical or mental health is in danger .
the way spanish women get around the situation is to sign a piece of paper testifying that if they do not abort , they will suffer psychologically .
the new government wants to legalise abortion in all cases for the first twelve weeks of pregnancy .
the public response to these proposed changes has generally been favourable .
it is interesting to note that more women than men voted for mr zapatero 's socialists .
the gay community and spanish students also favoured the socialists over the previous conservative administration .
yet the appetite for dramatic social change in spain in questionable .
surprise result the socialist party had not been predicted an election victory in the public opinion polls .
spaniards remains divided over whether the socialists , taken by surprise by the election results , are actually ready to govern .
significantly , election day came just 72 hours after the multiple train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800 others .
many people said they used their vote less in favour of the socialists , than against the former conservative government .
mr zapatero 's government also faces another obstacle in its ambitious reform agenda .
the election left it short of a parliamentary majority so it will have to look for outside political support when passing new legislation .
one thing is sure , though .
sceptical or not , most spaniards want this government to succeed .
after these last weeks of terror and of tears , they say , spain needs some stability and a fresh start .

but the new spanish prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , does not find the situation very funny .
he recently described spain 's domestic violence record as the country 's " worst shame " and an " unacceptable evil " .
on friday his government made a draft " gender violence " law the very first of the not even week-old administration .
it aims to bring new domestic violence legislation before parliament by the summer .
at least one woman dies every week in spain at the hands of her partner .
thousands stay in abusive relationships because , they say , there is nowhere else to go .
sadly , these figures are not uncommon in europe .
but there is a growing awareness here of the problem .
democracy in spain is only 25-years-old .
before that , during the 40-year-long dictatorship of general francisco franco , domestic violence was not considered a crime .
what it was , though , was taboo .
there is a spanish phrase , using the feminine article that says : " i broke it because it was mine " .
this attitude towards women is now changing fast , especially among the young .
the spanish oscars , the goyas , were won this year by a popular film called i give you my eyes , about domestic violence .
cases of domestic abuse feature on the evening news almost daily and spain 's tv chat shows , which are on morning , noon and night , regularly discuss the issue .
public sentiment earlier this year , roman catholic bishops caused an outcry with a report suggesting that sexual liberation since the 1960s had led to more men beating their wives .
although the majority of spaniards still describe themselves as catholic , church attendance levels are dwindling .
so mr zapatero was certainly tapping into public sentiment when , just a few hours after being sworn in as spain 's new premier , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the 11 march train attacks who were on the same ward .
maria teresa de la vega -lrb- left -rrb- is the first female deputy pm but it would be unfair to suggest that the previous conservative government ignored spain 's growing domestic violence figures .
the problem appears to be the implementation of the laws it passed , such as the enforcement of restraining orders , for example .
this is something the new government wants to improve .
women here have also complained that the spanish judiciary is ruled by conservative , older men who , they say , often rule against women 's interests .
and there is a growing demand for treatment programmes for the abusers .
at the moment there are only two institutes in spain that work with violent men to try to change their behaviour .
women 's image according to the new spanish government the country 's problem is a wider one , concerning not just the way abusers treat women but the image of women in spanish society in general .
the spanish minister for work and social affairs , jesus caldera , says spain needs a general " change in behaviour towards women " , which should be impressed upon school children through the study of " ethics and equality " .
he has called for a debate on the way women are portrayed in spanish advertisements and has announced the government 's intention to break women 's " chains of dependence " on their male counterparts by improving employment and housing provisions for women .
mr zapatero has promised to make equality between the sexes " an emblematic task " .
and where better to start than within his own cabinet ?
eight of the 16 posts are occupied by women , including spain 's first ever female deputy prime minister .
mr zapatero says his government will initiate a system of tax and other incentives to encourage spanish businesses to employ more women , especially at managerial level .
at the moment the proportion of women on boards of directors does not reach 10 % - and is less than 2 % in the biggest companies on the spanish stock exchange .
the government wants to ensure sexual equality from the lowest to the highest echelons of spanish society .
royal reform it has proposed changing the constitution as regards the succession to the spanish throne , where men are favoured over women .
any new legislation would not come into effect until the next generation , however .
spaniards have demonstrated against " sexist " violence spain 's prince felipe will become king after his father , even though he has two older sisters .
other proposed changes in gender legislation include the official recognition of homosexual partnerships -lrb- 68 % of spaniards said in a gallup poll last year that they were in favour of gay marriages -rrb- , and debating the rights of gay couples to adopt children .
mr zapatero also intends to alter radically spain 's abortion laws which , he says , are completely outdated .
abortion in spain is illegal except in three cases : if a woman has a deformed foetus , if she has been raped or if her physical or mental health is in danger .
the way spanish women get around the situation is to sign a piece of paper testifying that if they do not abort , they will suffer psychologically .
the new government wants to legalise abortion in all cases for the first twelve weeks of pregnancy .
the public response to these proposed changes has generally been favourable .
it is interesting to note that more women than men voted for mr zapatero 's socialists .
the gay community and spanish students also favoured the socialists over the previous conservative administration .

it aims to bring new domestic violence legislation before parliament by the summer .
at least one woman dies every week in spain at the hands of her partner .
thousands stay in abusive relationships because , they say , there is nowhere else to go .
sadly , these figures are not uncommon in europe .
but there is a growing awareness here of the problem .
democracy in spain is only 25-years-old .
before that , during the 40-year-long dictatorship of general francisco franco , domestic violence was not considered a crime .
what it was , though , was taboo .
there is a spanish phrase , using the feminine article that says : " i broke it because it was mine " .
this attitude towards women is now changing fast , especially among the young .
the spanish oscars , the goyas , were won this year by a popular film called i give you my eyes , about domestic violence .
cases of domestic abuse feature on the evening news almost daily and spain 's tv chat shows , which are on morning , noon and night , regularly discuss the issue .
public sentiment earlier this year , roman catholic bishops caused an outcry with a report suggesting that sexual liberation since the 1960s had led to more men beating their wives .
although the majority of spaniards still describe themselves as catholic , church attendance levels are dwindling .
so mr zapatero was certainly tapping into public sentiment when , just a few hours after being sworn in as spain 's new premier , he visited a woman in hospital who had been beaten and burned by her husband , as well as victims of the 11 march train attacks who were on the same ward .
maria teresa de la vega -lrb- left -rrb- is the first female deputy pm but it would be unfair to suggest that the previous conservative government ignored spain 's growing domestic violence figures .
the problem appears to be the implementation of the laws it passed , such as the enforcement of restraining orders , for example .
this is something the new government wants to improve .
women here have also complained that the spanish judiciary is ruled by conservative , older men who , they say , often rule against women 's interests .
and there is a growing demand for treatment programmes for the abusers .
at the moment there are only two institutes in spain that work with violent men to try to change their behaviour .
women 's image according to the new spanish government the country 's problem is a wider one , concerning not just the way abusers treat women but the image of women in spanish society in general .
the spanish minister for work and social affairs , jesus caldera , says spain needs a general " change in behaviour towards women " , which should be impressed upon school children through the study of " ethics and equality " .
he has called for a debate on the way women are portrayed in spanish advertisements and has announced the government 's intention to break women 's " chains of dependence " on their male counterparts by improving employment and housing provisions for women .
mr zapatero has promised to make equality between the sexes " an emblematic task " .
and where better to start than within his own cabinet ?
eight of the 16 posts are occupied by women , including spain 's first ever female deputy prime minister .
mr zapatero says his government will initiate a system of tax and other incentives to encourage spanish businesses to employ more women , especially at managerial level .
at the moment the proportion of women on boards of directors does not reach 10 % - and is less than 2 % in the biggest companies on the spanish stock exchange .
the government wants to ensure sexual equality from the lowest to the highest echelons of spanish society .
royal reform it has proposed changing the constitution as regards the succession to the spanish throne , where men are favoured over women .
any new legislation would not come into effect until the next generation , however .
spaniards have demonstrated against " sexist " violence spain 's prince felipe will become king after his father , even though he has two older sisters .
other proposed changes in gender legislation include the official recognition of homosexual partnerships -lrb- 68 % of spaniards said in a gallup poll last year that they were in favour of gay marriages -rrb- , and debating the rights of gay couples to adopt children .
mr zapatero also intends to alter radically spain 's abortion laws which , he says , are completely outdated .
abortion in spain is illegal except in three cases : if a woman has a deformed foetus , if she has been raped or if her physical or mental health is in danger .
the way spanish women get around the situation is to sign a piece of paper testifying that if they do not abort , they will suffer psychologically .
the new government wants to legalise abortion in all cases for the first twelve weeks of pregnancy .
the public response to these proposed changes has generally been favourable .
it is interesting to note that more women than men voted for mr zapatero 's socialists .
the gay community and spanish students also favoured the socialists over the previous conservative administration .
yet the appetite for dramatic social change in spain in questionable .
surprise result the socialist party had not been predicted an election victory in the public opinion polls .
spaniards remains divided over whether the socialists , taken by surprise by the election results , are actually ready to govern .
significantly , election day came just 72 hours after the multiple train bombings in madrid which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800 others .
many people said they used their vote less in favour of the socialists , than against the former conservative government .
mr zapatero 's government also faces another obstacle in its ambitious reform agenda .
the election left it short of a parliamentary majority so it will have to look for outside political support when passing new legislation .
one thing is sure , though .
sceptical or not , most spaniards want this government to succeed .
after these last weeks of terror and of tears , they say , spain needs some stability and a fresh start .

the state-owned operator said the changes were needed so it could continue to provide a ' one-price-goes-anywhere ' postal service .
royal mail is facing increasing competition in its domestic market .
it said the proposals would see a fairer and more simple pricing system , better reflecting the actual cost of handing mail .
cost factor royal mail 's head of size based pricing , david dale , said : " these proposals would bring our prices more in line with our costs . "
he said : " in the new competitive postal market it is commercially impossible for royal mail to keep its traditional pricing structure . "
royal mail 's pricing structure has been in place for decades , and was inherited from a time when mail was sorted by hand .
mr dale said : " most other postal administrations already use size in pricing mail because this is the key cost factor in the modern postal industry . "
fewer stamps royal mail insisted that the changes would not increase britain 's overall postal bill .
mr dales said some customers would experience price rises and other price cuts , but the vast majority - 74 % - would be unaffected by the proposed changes .

the survey says four years after eu leaders agreed economic reforms to make the eu the most dynamic economy in the world by 2010 , progress has been slow .
only nordic countries have managed to surpass the united states .
the wef says on a number of measures of competitiveness , the average eu score , out of 7 , is 4.97 , and 5.55 for the us .
the top accession countries on this measure were estonia and slovenia , while the applicant countries of romania and bulgaria are at the bottom of the pile .
" policy makers in europe will have to focus their energies on accelerating the pace of reform , " according to dr augusto lopez-claros , chief economist of the world economic forum .
nordic triumph only finland , denmark and sweden ranked higher than the us among the 25 eu members -lrb- as of 1 may -rrb- .

the nordic countries also scored highly on social inclusion and sustainable development .
the uk , which came fourth after the scandinavians , scored better on liberalisation and financial services , but lower on social inclusion and innovation .
spain , italy , portugal and greece were lowest among existing eu members on these measures .
but perhaps surprisingly , italy , a g7 member , performed worse than spain , and below slovenia and estonia , on several criteria .
baltic surge among the 10 accession countries , most scored at or below the level of greece except for the baltic countries , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia .
poland , with the largest economy and population among those joining the eu , ranked 9th , just above turkey , romania and bulgaria -lrb- cyprus was not ranked -rrb- .
but the report points out that the top accession countries are actually better prepared to compete than the worst three existing members - with the exception of telecoms liberalisation and completion of the single market .
the eight measures of competitiveness were : an information society for all ; innovation and r & d ; liberalisation of the single market ; building network industries ; creating efficient financial services ; improving the enterprise culture ; increasing social inclusion ; and enhancing sustainable development .

the company , which specialises in major 20th century ballets and new works , will give the premiere of a new version of romeo and juliet on tuesday .
artistic director gary harris performed with the english national ballet it will also be showing a range of new ballets in london , including frenzy , with music by cult band split enz .
the company 's artistic director , gary harris , has strong roots in the uk .
mr harris told bbc news online he had been captivated with new zealand when he went there initially to teach the company .
mr harris , a former dancer with the english national ballet , and ballet master with the royal ballet , says that the enthusiasm of kiwis for their own cultural institutions is infectious .
after taking residence in newly built premises at st james theatre , wellington , mr harris proceeded with commissioning a series of innovative modern ballets -lrb- for the company 's 50th anniversary last year -rrb- to complement the modern classics of stravinsky and balanchine that it had become known for .
avant-garde styling now he is hoping to show the rest of the world the fruits of his labour , with a tour of the united states already pencilled in for next year .
in a bold move , he is planning on showing one of the uk 's favourite ballets , romeo and juliet , in a new version by choreographer christopher hampson .
his romeo , he says , combines elements of baz luhrmann 's avant-garde styling with the classic love duets and authentically vicious fight scenes reminiscent of the matrix series of films .
blood-red lighting adds to the atmospheric effect , allowing his young athletic ballet stars show both physicality and tenderness .
kiwi frenzy there is a strong influence of the uk 's ballet rambert in the recent repertoire of the nz ballet .
the company will be premiering its production of romeo and juliet and the highlight of their triple bill , also showing at sadler 's wells , is rambert choreographer mark baldwin , a native new zealander who was born in fiji and danced with the nz company before moving to the uk .
frenzy features music by new zealand 's most celebrated rock band , split enz , and also uses moves from traditional maori culture , where dance plays a strong role .
the work was originally performed as a full-length work with a 40-strong group of maori kapa haka dancers , te matarae i orehu , and their choreographer wetini mitai-ngatai .
it uses elements of humour , with zoot suits , silver tutus and quiffs to contrast with the maori moves .
mr harris believes that european audiences will appreciate the fresh feel and enthusiasm of his young company .
unlike uk companies , there are no principal dancers , and the 32 members all play many different roles .
jane turner will be dancing the part of juliet mr harris is also keen to deepen his links with new zealand 's rich cultural heritage - something which the rest of the world is beginning to recognise .
the co-choreographer of frenzy , wetini mitai-ngatai , went on to work on the film whale rider , whose maori star keisha castle-hughes was the youngest actress ever nominated for an oscar .
the royal new zealand ballet plays at sadler 's wells in london until 1 may .
it then tours the uk , playing at glasgow 's theatre royal -lrb- 5-8 may -rrb- ; edinburgh 's festival theatre -lrb- 11-15 may -rrb- ; high wycombe -lrb- 18-21 may -rrb- and bath 's theatre royal -lrb- 25-29 may -rrb- .

the company , which specialises in major 20th century ballets and new works , will give the premiere of a new version of romeo and juliet on tuesday .
artistic director gary harris performed with the english national ballet it will also be showing a range of new ballets in london , including frenzy , with music by cult band split enz .
the company 's artistic director , gary harris , has strong roots in the uk .
mr harris told bbc news online he had been captivated with new zealand when he went there initially to teach the company .
mr harris , a former dancer with the english national ballet , and ballet master with the royal ballet , says that the enthusiasm of kiwis for their own cultural institutions is infectious .
after taking residence in newly built premises at st james theatre , wellington , mr harris proceeded with commissioning a series of innovative modern ballets -lrb- for the company 's 50th anniversary last year -rrb- to complement the modern classics of stravinsky and balanchine that it had become known for .
avant-garde styling now he is hoping to show the rest of the world the fruits of his labour , with a tour of the united states already pencilled in for next year .
in a bold move , he is planning on showing one of the uk 's favourite ballets , romeo and juliet , in a new version by choreographer christopher hampson .
his romeo , he says , combines elements of baz luhrmann 's avant-garde styling with the classic love duets and authentically vicious fight scenes reminiscent of the matrix series of films .
blood-red lighting adds to the atmospheric effect , allowing his young athletic ballet stars show both physicality and tenderness .
kiwi frenzy there is a strong influence of the uk 's ballet rambert in the recent repertoire of the nz ballet .
the company will be premiering its production of romeo and juliet and the highlight of their triple bill , also showing at sadler 's wells , is rambert choreographer mark baldwin , a native new zealander who was born in fiji and danced with the nz company before moving to the uk .
frenzy features music by new zealand 's most celebrated rock band , split enz , and also uses moves from traditional maori culture , where dance plays a strong role .
the work was originally performed as a full-length work with a 40-strong group of maori kapa haka dancers , te matarae i orehu , and their choreographer wetini mitai-ngatai .
it uses elements of humour , with zoot suits , silver tutus and quiffs to contrast with the maori moves .
mr harris believes that european audiences will appreciate the fresh feel and enthusiasm of his young company .
unlike uk companies , there are no principal dancers , and the 32 members all play many different roles .
jane turner will be dancing the part of juliet mr harris is also keen to deepen his links with new zealand 's rich cultural heritage - something which the rest of the world is beginning to recognise .
the co-choreographer of frenzy , wetini mitai-ngatai , went on to work on the film whale rider , whose maori star keisha castle-hughes was the youngest actress ever nominated for an oscar .
the royal new zealand ballet plays at sadler 's wells in london until 1 may .
it then tours the uk , playing at glasgow 's theatre royal -lrb- 5-8 may -rrb- ; edinburgh 's festival theatre -lrb- 11-15 may -rrb- ; high wycombe -lrb- 18-21 may -rrb- and bath 's theatre royal -lrb- 25-29 may -rrb- .

brazil had complained that us payments kept world cotton prices too low and gave its producers an edge over less developed and less well-funded rivals .
it is the first time that a country 's domestic farm subsidies have been challenged and may prompt more cases .
the us has said it will appeal against the decision unless it is changed .
according to brazil 's complaint , the us paid its farmers almost $ 4bn -lrb- £ 2.2bn -rrb- in cotton subsidies between 2001 and 2002 for a crop that was worth $ 3bn .
brazil said this led its farmers to lose sales worth $ 600m in that period because us farmers could sell cotton at less than cost price .
in focus trade , and especially subsidies and import tariffs , has been in the spotlight during past years as a global economic slowdown led to job losses and prompted calls for greater protection of domestic industries .
this is a war that must continue roberto azevedo , legal advisor to brazil wto talks in cancun , mexico , collapsed in 2003 amid allegations from all sides of intransigence and unrealistic demands .
the us more recently became embroiled in a spat with the european union and asia over steel tariffs , and it has also accused china of keeping its currency weak to boost exports .
trade also has become one of the platforms on which the upcoming us election looks set to be fought .
democrat challenger john kerry said on monday that the us should be more aggressive in filing unfair trade cases at the wto .
great leveller brazil 's top negotiator at the wto , however , said that tuesday 's ruling over cotton could lead to a rebalancing of global trade , with poorer countries getting a better deal .

this wto panel " is going to show how important it is that you really change this policy of developed nations , " he added .
roberto azevedo , a legal adviser to brazil 's foreign ministry , was more forthright saying that " this is a war that must continue " .
the us , however , stands by its policy and said it has " serious concerns with aspects of the panel 's report " .
the subsidies , it says , are within wto limits .
it has until 10 may to appeal against the decision .

click here to return to the first page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of the opinion we have received : a promising future for all south africans , and a huge step in the right direction for the entire continent .
famara demba , kombo nyofelleh , the gambia there was no doubt that the anc would win this election , they have performed adequately over the last 10 years and deserve the support that they have .
my only concern is the large majority , by which they have won , effectively negating any opposition .
my one hope that we as a country continue in the path that we have thus far taken , a path that is becoming easier to travel , especially when we are being led by people like president mbeki , trevor manuel and ibrahim rasool .
paul , cape town , south africa last year when i briefly visited the land of my birth , i could see progress ajit somers , leopold as a former member of the anc , now living in australia , it gives me great pleasure to learn that the anc has won an overwhelming victory .
last year when i briefly visited the land of my birth , i could see progress .
it is not only in south africa that people are getting murdered , here in melbourne ; we have lately come across horrible murders .
since coming to power the anc has provided homes , electricity and clean water to the vast numbers of the population which racist , white governments from 1652 failed to do .
long live the spirit of oliver tambo and the anc .
i am elated that kwazulu-natal has been finally liberated .
viva anc .
ajit somers , leopold , victoria , australia congratulations anc !
bravo mbeki .
hope this time around you will be more committed than before to improve the quality of the lives of the thousands of south africans that continue to live in poverty .
josephus mamie , scotland / sierra leone it is rather strange that mugabe 's friend thabo mbeki declares a standard for what the world sees as free and fair elections in south africa and yet on the other hand failed to condemn the process in zimbabwe which was clearly flawed .
james raymond , northants so far developments in sa have proven the critics wrong , i so much wish that sa will become the change agent for africa and the living proof that africans are successfully manage african affairs .
ron schipper , johannesburg reading some of the comments on this site just reinforce the fact that i 'm ashamed to be white .
we brutalized an entire nation , and then we whinge that things are n't quite as perfect for us !
what hubris .
of course things are a bit harder for us now , how could they not be .
since our police used to shoot blacks dead if they dared enter the suburbs at night , i 'm not very surprised that there was less crime in the apartheid years .
and i 'm sure i 'm going to get a lot of responses saying " i did n't vote for the nats " .
well , neither did i -lrb- i was too young -rrb- , but i 'm still culpable for what they did , and i still benefited from the evil they perpetrated .
i 'm grateful to have the opportunity to make restitution by handing over taxes to uplift the poor , by giving to charity , by doing social work .
not by snivelling off to a foreign land and whining about how hard done by i am .
sean , johannesburg you have done africa proud with the great conduct of your elections dr. mobolaji e. aluko , nigeria as a nigerian conscious of our own disastrous national elections held last year to the day , and of our equally disastrous local government elections just last month , i am green with envy .
congratulations , south africa !
you have done africa proud with the great conduct of your elections !
all the political parties are winners .
dr. mobolaji e. aluko , nigeria i am happy that the elections went so well / peacefully .
i just wish though that the world would also see the effect that affirmative action is having on white south africans .
apartheid was wrong - no doubt , but the current situation is no better than a ' watered ' down apartheid .
we also now have an ' elite ' black minority that is getting richer while the rest of the black majority remain fundamentally the same .
politicians in s.a seem to spend more time finding places onto which they can place their name -lrb- streets / botanical gardens / shopping squares -rrb- than they do making a positive difference to s.a - in fact the only time one hears from president mbeki seems to be at election time .
the quote " power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely " seems pretty apt unless the politicians start addressing the real issues -lrb- crime / employment and aids -rrb- in this beautiful country of ours .
les , johannesburg being a zimbabwean living in south africa and having been here since 2001 , i feel proud of south africa .
the anc has a realistic vision not only for sa but africa and the world .
viva anc and the spirit of nelson mandela .
when i look at my country , " melancholy " is what describes how i feel .
golden , south africa the anc was , is and will always be the majority party in sa .
its platform of providing jobs and support for the african renaissance bodes well both for sa and africa as a whole .
i congratulate president mbeki and the anc .
aminu wouba , kumba , cameroon now is the true testing time for the anc may , durban , sa my husband and i decided to stay in a country that we love .
the past 10 years have been a challenge in many ways i.e. affirmative action , unemployment rate , crime , etc .
however , now is the true testing time for the anc .
will they use their power to further a great democracy here in sa or abuse it and follow many of our neighbouring countries into corruption and decay .
the choice is up to them .
lets hope they " do what is right " .
may , durban , sa just more uncontrolled crime , litter strewn dirty streets .
i no longer go to south africa , they can do what they want with it now .
keith , sunderland , uk to keith , sunderland : if you think that sa is all uncontrolled crime and litter-strewn streets i suggest you do go back i think you would be pleasantly shocked .
your words are how i remember an apartheid time jo 'burg , when i visited this christmas jo 'burg , durban and cape town were all at their most beautiful and much cleaner and friendlier than i have ever imagined it could be .
chloe , bristol , uk congratulations for maturity during elections .
let the government get back to work and continue to improve life in the beautiful sa .
fipaza , manchester , uk congratulations !
thabo mbeki and the anc .
but listen , the political tussle may have been won , but the economic liberation of mostly black south africans has not been forthcoming .
it 's time to re-define priorities before the people run out of patience .
anthony ibeh , hawthorne , california life has changed so much in that there is no security .
of the 21,000 murders last year in sa my brother was one of them .
sa must attend to this problem then we will be in a position to return to our homeland .
ray absalom , auckland , nz as expected whites who flee south africa and complain of how bad things are seems to forget the suffering that blacks have undergo for centuries .
there is so much hypocrisy amongst the whites who blame the blacks strive for success on crime in south africa .
wake up and smell the roses white domination has ended in south africa richard smith , toronto , canada to richard smith , toronto : white domination has long been gone in south africa ; i lived through the changes there years ago .
now it is a free , democratic country with a huge black majority - there will never be a doubt that the anc will be staying in power for many years to come .
these elections just go to show that people are still learning , it is all new for them , but maybe some day , they will come to realise that south africa may not actually be better off run by the anc .
it is voting by colour and existing powers rule .
andy m , amsterdam , netherlands any party with a huge majority can pass any bills they see fit ross brindle , windsor maybe if the anc had not prevented anyone outside of south africa from voting the results would have been slightly different .
clearly they would have won but a strong opposition may be able to even out the political spectrum in south africa .
any party with a huge majority can pass any bills they see fit .
ross brindle , windsor , uk how wonderful it was that so many of us bothered to vote last wednesday .
this clearly states that we south africans really care about our new found democracy .
however , as so many have already pointed out , a democracy can not remain healthy for long if there is no viable opposition .
the anc have again an overwhelming majority for the third time .
it is again quite obvious that voting was along racial lines and sadly , this will be the case for the foreseeable future .
peter grist , grahamstown , sa this amount of power in the hands of government in any country is not good , especially one who 's democratic roots are still so shallow .
i hope i am proved wrong but i believe we will go the way of all the other countries on this continent : total power , one party state , and a president that one can not get out even with crow bars !
again , i hope i am proved wrong .
unfortunately there is no precedent .
david , simonstown , south africa yet another weak minded puppet government in africa comes to power while the resources still belong to the west eko , uk this is basically a farce .
10 years on and the country is still in the grip of neo-colonialism , the majority of land still owned by the small white minority .
anc is an elite party not for the masses who have been misled by propaganda .
yet another weak minded puppet government in africa comes to power while the resources still belong to the west .
eko , uk viva anc viva .
well done independent electoral commission .
congratulations to my fellow south african 's on achieving 10 years of democracy and being the peace loving miracle rainbow nation that we are .
we are inspiration to the world and should hold our heads up high with pride in being an example for others to follow .
mahmood salojee , johannesburg , south africa it 's a shame we always end up with all these whingeing ex-pats -lrb- hope their visas are in order ! -rrb- lesley , bruce , alice , pat , tm , sigi guy , amanda , carolyn , luc and richard , - if you really care , get back there and help - then you will deserve your vote .
with rights come responsibilities .
nestor , england institutionalised racism is still alive richard , joburg , rsa illuminating how so many positive comments about rsa come from those far removed from the country .
from one who is n't , may i mention that institutionalised racism is still alive and well in the form of a vicious and pervasive affirmative action / black empowerment policy that has succeeded in creating a small number of obscenely rich blacks and is forcing a large number of taxpayers to emigrate .
an interesting statistic has it that for every taxpayer in the uk and usa there are 2-3 voters ; in rsa the ratio is no less than 1:12 .
so much for democracy rsa-style .
richard , joburg , rsa i think the elections and the atmosphere was great .
the results show that people are still voting on racial lines which means that the government has no effective opposition .
still maybe in time people wo n't feel the need to be " loyal " or scared of losing their vote .
i hope that the government respects the constitution .
peter , johannesburg , south africa the first real test of south africa 's democracy will come during the next 5 years jonathan gill the first real test of south africa 's democracy will come during the next 5 years .
will the anc be able to resist the temptation to alter the constitution to allow pres .
mbeki to have a third term as president ?
other african leaders have not been able to resist this temptation .
south africa 's democracy has yet to be truly tested .
what would happen if the da , for instance , won 51 % of the vote ?
a smooth transition would prove that democracy is really working .
jonathan gill , some people will question if democracy is working if one party gets 70 % of the vote and i agree that south african opposition parties need to work on their identity .
but the british have no right to lecture the south africans on this point .
it 's better than our democratic system , where one party gets only 42 % of the vote yet has a huge parliamentary majority , which i believe leads to voter apathy .
oh and our upper house -lrb- second chamber -rrb- is appointed by the prime ministers office !
ian , marlow i am a 25-year-old white afrikaans male living in my beloved country south africa .
when it comes to affirmative action and being afraid of zimbabwean style land-grabs i should be the first to run away .
but i am not !
i love this place .
i am positive about the future !
i have a great job in a big corporate .
i recently bought my first property - in joburg of all places .
i have never experienced bad crime , only small petty stuff .
i enjoy a better quality of life than most of my white brothers that have packed their bags .
i have to agree with our government , if you do n't live here , you should not vote .
bernard jansen , johannesburg , sa south africa is a true democracy like botswana ... the overwhelming dominance of the african national congress does reflect the views of the majority .
in botswana 's 8 free and fair democratic elections since the 1960s , we 've seen the dominance of the botswana democratic party- because the majority do want it in power !
but in botswana 's history there 's always been a parliamentary opposition that 's been vocal -lrb- bnf -rrb- , an independent judiciary , free press , there 's never been a single political prisoner , there 's never ever been one political death , botswana is rated by transparency international as the least corrupt in africa -lrb- less corrupt than some western states -rrb- .
furthermore , when the british governed us for 81 yrs until 1966 , they left botswana as the poorest nation in africa with no infrastructure to speak of .
but after 3 decades of democracy and black rule , botswana has moved from near 100 % poverty levels to less than 40 % .
so those who believe a popular black government means dictatorship and underdevelopment are wrong .
congrats to our dear neighbour !
pako , gaborone , botswana south african democratic system is an example , and a modal to follow faztudo langisse , maputo-mozambique south african democratic system is an example , and a modal to follow .
both previous south african elections were carried out in a peaceful mood and no violence .
africa should take chance on that .
african leaders should know that hankering to power in order to perform corruption can only lead to war and other conflicts faztudo langisse , maputo-mozambique why do western governments and multinational corporations fear that south africa is turning into a one-party state while at the same time they hail botswana as the standard-bearer for african democracy ?
-lrb- mr mogae 's party has been in power since independence in 1966 ! -rrb-
andrew , minneapolis , united states the anc have obviously secured a victory here , but they must continue to address the problem of wealth inequity further .
the economy is stable but too many south africans live below the poverty line .
reuben loffman , whitstable , england i must admit to having something of an obsessive interest in sa because of its diversity and history .
it certainly is nice to see something of an african success story for a change !
but there is no doubt that something must be done about the aids epidemic and the terrible crime problem .
the thing is that the sa government is highly dependant on the white taxpayer -lrb- a hard fact to swallow for many but sadly true -rrb- and unless the crime problem is sorted soon the " white flight " will continue and the new black middle class will find itself with most of the financial burden and the anc will find it harder and harder to get the cash to improve the lives of the poor .
i would like to see sa foreign policy trying to export this freedom to the rest of the continent starting in zimbabwe .
good luck to sa for the future may the next decade be even better than the last !
jon stokes , nottingham , uk i am very glad to see that the south africans are voting for the third time which shows that democracy is growing in africa .
mupeta moses , lusaka zambia i think south africa as a whole is doing better and better everyday even though there are a few setbacks siphesihle zwane , durban , south africa i think south africa as a whole is doing better and better everyday even though there are a few setbacks .
i 'm a black south african who thinks life has changed for the better in the past 10 years even though the anc government is not delivering on all its promises .
if i were old enough to vote i would undoubtedly have voted for the da .
i think it would do a better job than the anc .
siphesihle zwane , durban , south africa i remember the collapse of apartheid being one of the scariest events of my life - not knowing what to expect !
the fear proved unfounded , with the two days of voting being the first two days i could remember without any incidents of faction fighting .
i voted for the np - they after all were the initialisers of the wheel of change .
life has greatly changed in sa in the last 10 years , mostly for the better , but the tremendous increase in the crime rate and the governments apparent inability to control this is leading to our people -lrb- like me -rrb- taking their families leaving the homes and people they love - all due to crime - in search of a more peaceful future for our children .
lesley phillips , bristol , england as a zimbabwean i see the writing is on the wall for south africa .
the liberals in europe have no idea what democracy in africa is actually all about .
we zimbabweans used to laugh at zambia , just as the south africans now laugh at us !
it is very sad .
alex , london i am south african who always had thought there was no crime in europe or the uk , until i came here bheki , uk in the social engineering of south africa , there are negatives indeed , like crime .
crime and fear of it is a problem to many countries .
unreliable police stats and negative sensational media reporting contribute to the fear .
i am south african who always had thought there was no crime in europe or the uk , until i came here to see daily crime reports in the newspapers .
it would be wrong to racial-ise the issue of crime in south africa as a blacks vs whites issue .
the majority of crime victims in south africa have mostly been the majority blacks -lrb- from apartheid crime to general crime -rrb- .
one or two incidents against a white citizen ... the horns are blown beyond proportion , with tv cameras and international media coverage !
crime is a risk faced by anyone , anywhere .
the risks are almost the same whether you are in ny , london or johannesburg .
i am studying and going back as soon as i finish .
lets go back home and stop the brain drain ... our country needs us .
we are causing unnecessary congestion for other countries .
bheki , uk south africa is going the way of mexico with one party rule .
this leads ultimately to complacency and inertia .
sharon schafer , pennsylvania , usa i am a greek south african , who has been living in athens for two years .
but , i am returning to south africa next week , because my time away has made me realise how much i had left behind .
this successful election , only strengthens my view that i am returning to the best country in the world , a proud south african .
ioannis condogiannis , athens / johannesburg whenever i feel cynical about modern democracy , i stop , think of south africa and smile .
there 's always hope .
alister , london , uk wow !
what an amazing event the end of the apartheid was .
i would have been only eleven years old at the time but i still remember vividly , pictures on tv of whites and blacks holding hands raised high .
ten years on , i applaud people like nelson mandela and fw de klerk who , through their perseverance , courage and willingness to look beyond past prejudices and injustices , were instrumental in bringing about change .
obviously , the road ahead wo n't be an easy one , but may these values continue to be held high as south africans work together for a better south africa .
our hopes and prayers are with you in this next phase .
previn john , perth , western australia the dreams of 1994 lives .
the foundation is solid , we are not going back .
south africa enters her second decade of freedom with confidence .
we will succeed .
the future looks bright and success is certain mandla mabuza , johannesburg , south africa south africa has shown remarkable maturity in creating a responsible democracy mark , vienna , austria despite overwhelming racism against the black population for many years south africa has shown remarkable maturity in creating a responsible democracy which is trying to work for the people and not the politicians or bureaucracy .
i wish you all well in your fight to reduce poverty and increase healthcare .
mark , vienna , austria everybody seems to be praising south african democracy .
however , i 've never heard of a truly mature democratic system where the ruling party gets over two-thirds of the popular vote whereas the largest opposition party barely gets 16 % !
south africa will not be a full-fledged democracy until a credible political opposition emerges to represent a real alternative to the government of the day and hold that government accountable .
if predictions of a anc sweep are confirmed , i 'm afraid south africa will be one step closer to becoming a one-party state like so many other failed republics in the african continent .
marcelo bruno , sao paulo , brazil having a vote is empowerment .
the whole basis of democracy is founded upon it .
the anc has had massive hurdles to clear from the outset of their government , including issues related to hiv , housing , unemployment and crime .
significant progress has been made in all these areas .
leadership is only truly leadership when real challenge exists .
well done sa .
dirk , johannesburg , south africa many things have improved in the country since 1994 .
this is not all due to the government but often due to the influence of big business .
the government is severely inept and the country is being held together by overseas investors and big business .
corruption , crime , massive unemployment , ignorance with regard to hiv / aids and huge chasms between rich and poor are massive issues that are just not being addressed .
the anc was the only option after the previous government but it is time for a change .
with a two thirds majority the anc can now change the constitution and turn the country into more of a dictatorship -lrb- see zimbabwe ! -rrb-
dave bryant , cape town , south africa yesterday was a truly wonderful day .
i went around to the varying polling stations around cape town and found an elated sense of celebration .
all those doomsayers who compare sa to zimbabwe will find if they ever come here : a free and critical press , parties free to campaign and a patriotic and loving people who are determined to make our democracy work .
gary , cape town , south africa i can not though , as much as i love south africa go back in the state that it is in now bruce , london , england i am living in london without the burglar bars and the worry of my fiancee driving at night thinking she is going to be hijacked , like she was at gunpoint while she lived in sa .
being a white male , if i was to return to sa with 8 years investment banking experience in london and a degree , i would battle to get a job even though i have lots to offer a company .
i never supported apartheid and was very pleased when it was ended .
i can not though , as much as i love south africa -lrb- and i do go back at least once a year to see family , who have been burgled 3 times last year i might add -rrb- , go back in the state that it is in now , with a president that does not believe that aids comes from hiv , crime as it is and no opportunities for employment .
his silence on zimbabwe and the fact that they will get a two thirds majority after this election which means they will be able to change the constitution , tells me that sa land owners also better be careful .
bruce , london , england mbeki and anc victory in the just ended elections is clearly a symbol of confidence of the people of south africa on the ongoing reform done since the end of apartheid system in the country .
south african people remember what anc did since the struggle for liberation of their land from the yoke of segregation , brutal harassment and massive killings of the black community in their own land .
epson luhwago , dar es salaam , tanzania having recently completed a study on hollow democracy in south africa , i wonder if enough people realize how little check there is on the executive branch of the south african government ?
i wish only good for this country with the dream constitution ... including a functioning and critical opposition .
tgk , uk i am a 14-year old canadian boy .
i am constantly studying south africa , overjoyed by how nice a country it is .
if this is any testament to how good life in south africa must now be , i plan to move there when i finish university .
tom cook , ontario , canada african leaders should learn from their continental brother south africa manuel adamu , baney , equatorial guinea african leaders should learn from their continental brother south africa .
let the country decide , it should not be impose on them .
it is not a rigged election like what we have been experiencing in other parts of the continent .
south africans keep it up ! ! !
thank ya .
manuel adamu , baney , equatorial guinea i have never had the opportunity to express my democratic right to vote in south africa as i was too young to vote in the first elections and have now been denied my vote twice as i have been abroad .
i wish one day south africa will be truly a democratic country where all its citizens will be able to vote and racially equality will be truly fair .
i have never ever voted for a government in my country and the reason i had to leave my country was because i am now been penalized for being white and affirmative actions hinders my job prospect .
ian gardiner , london , uk although life can be very testing at times here , the great thing is there is so much opportunity to make a difference .
and i am proud to be living in a non-aligned country with a human-rights laden constitution .
viva south africa !
bruce gillespie , jo 'burg , south africa to all the complainants in the many emails from abroad .
do n't sit whining about no vote in the coffee bars of foreign lands .
you want to vote , come home and vote .
in other words , put up or shut up .
des currie , umdloti , south africa the people of south africa should be an inspiration to all those people in the " established " democracies of the west who can not be bothered to vote .
shame on us .
kenneth lockie , baltimore , usa i assume this election will be another huge victory for the anc .
i have to wonder , if one party wins huge majorities over and over again , is democracy really taking root ?
i wish sa all the luck in the world , but there should be effective and peaceful opposition parties somewhere in this equation .
jeremy , florida usa i expressed my democratic right to vote for the first time today , and am overwhelmed with pride and joy for this wonderful country john , cape town , south africa i expressed my democratic right to vote for the first time today , and am overwhelmed with pride and joy for this wonderful country .
i eagerly anticipate the next decade of democracy , to be part of further exciting change .
it 's interesting to note how opinionated many of the ex-pats are , and while i 'm sure many of them have their personal reasons for leaving , may they please keep their cynicism to themselves , so the rest of us can celebrate the excitement of a country as one .
it is their loss .
thank you to others for their compliments and positive criticism .
john , cape town , south africa the large turnout has proven that apartheid in south africa is dead and buried .
it has shown that if given the chance people will take part in choosing their leaders and future .
ibeabuchi chinedu , lagos , nigeria i am a white living in south africa .
i disagree with the negative -lrb- and somewhat bitter -rrb- comments by some ex-south africans about life here .
the country is not crumbling .
we are not about to follow zimbabwe 's route .
south africa has a great future , for all its people .
come home and see for yourself what a wonderful country we are building for ourselves .
well done south africans for another peaceful election .
matthew west , stellenbosch , south africa i am saddened that as many herald the great new south africa , i was unable to vote today , my right as a citizen and south african , because i was not in the country .
a tragedy that even though i attempted to register or make arrangements to vote at an embassy abroad i was told by an official in sa ' if you are not in the country , no vote ' .
tm , berlin , germany huge changes like that of south africa give me hope in humanity , and make me see a chance for other seemingly unsolvable conflicts such as palestine and israel .
it should be a precedent to wave in front of them !
brian , gibraltar congratulations to the rainbow nation .
remember , every time you 're voting you are celebrating the fall of apartheid ...
seble , amsterdam , the netherlands i voted this morning in a quiet cape town suburb with my mom , dad , brother and sister .
i watched presidents mbeki and mandela voting when i woke up , and shook with anger and euphoria when i remembered that , like my father , this was only the third time they had voted .
i was too young to vote in 1994 , and in 1999 i voted in london because i was on a working holiday there at the time .
i cried most of the day because i missed home so much .
the past ten years have been incredible .
incredibly tumultuous and incredibly scary for some no doubt , but here we are ten years later , most of us still smiling .
what a country we live in .
today i want to salute my fellow south africans , and all the british and other foreign south africa fans who have so lovingly embraced our country 's miracle and offered their support and good wishes .
we 're going to prove all the naysayers so wrong .
siraj , cape town , south africa south africans should be proud of the relatively peaceful transition that has taken place over the last 10 years james miller , harlow , uk south africans should be proud of the relatively peaceful transition that has taken place over the last 10 years , i hope that they will all use the right to vote .
i would , however , question the lack of leadership from president mbeki in relation to dealing with the problems of zimbabwe .
he is in a very powerful and influential position to bring some sense to mugabe but has remained very quiet on the matter , a serious dereliction of his duty as the foremost african leader .
james miller , harlow , uk south africa is heading the right way .
everyone is now has the right to vote and free to express his / her own views in an election .
however , the fight against crime and aids pandemic remains the challenge for any leader who will win this election .
all south african should unite to fight these two obstacles the same way the freedom fighters united to end apartheid .
emmanuel gonda , canada / sudan tributes paid to former president madiba .
congratulations for leading a great country out of apartheid without war .
thanks for forgiving those who did not know what they were doing when incarcerating you .
magugu w mangwe , swaziland south africa 's transition from apartheid to democracy has been miraculous .
nelson mandela more than anyone else deserves credit for this .
however , south africa is becoming more and more of a one party state .
i have a lingering fear that , given time , it will go the way of zimbabwe .
sm , usa -lrb- ex sa and zimbabwe -rrb- i am a south african and have been in london now for 2 months .
it saddens me greatly that i am not allowed to vote .
so many south africans are being denied their constitutional right to vote .
i can not understand how this new legislation was formulated under our constitution .
sigi prinsloo , london uk there was no way i could miss my opportunity to vote because i think we -lrb- south africans -rrb- are heading in the right direction sikonathi mantshantsha , johannesburg i travelled 36km to vote this morning -lrb- 14 april 2004 -rrb- because i moved house after the deadline to register to vote .
when i got there the queue was long and i stood for an hour and-a-half -lrb- i saw a friend of mine who agreed to stick me in front of her -rrb- before i could cast my vote .
there was no way i could miss my opportunity to vote because i think we -lrb- south africans -rrb- are heading in the right direction .
i , like most other black people , feel more dignified that i can elect my own leaders to rule the country .
it was my second vote and my wife 's first .
sikonathi mantshantsha , johannesburg , south africa south africa has done the seemingly impossible in its stable transition from apartheid to democracy .
yes , it has its problems , including crime , hiv / aids , but things are improving all the time , and the majority of south africans are seeing this .
change takes time , and to see what has been done in a relatively short space of time is magnificent .
despite what cynics will say south africa is a beacon of hope for the world and a symbol for the beauty of multiculturalism and multiracialism everywhere .
hats off to mandela , mbeki and all those who have walked this tight-rope so successfully .
jason robinson , dublin , ireland .
i am a proud south african but do n't feel i have a say in my country 's future .
why ?
i have tried for weeks on end to get hold of somebody at the south african high commission in london to ask about the elections and where i could go and vote .
the answer i got on the other end of the phone was " i do n't know , the man that you must speak to is not here " .
this is what i got every time i rang .
very frustrating and not helpful at all .
alice lee abida , luton , uk having a vote does n't put food in your belly .
this is something the people of sa have learnt the hard way .
my husband and i are in nz because he could n't find a job as a secondary school science teacher in sa - when the sa government tells its people that it is committed to education it is lying .
i loathed the old government and apartheid , but i think the anc is a bad government .
they fail the people who vote for them and yet those people continue to vote for them .
sa wake up and smell the country crumbling around your ears .
and do n't believe everything you read - things may be better for some , but things have n't changed at all for most .
cath , new zealand to cath , new zealand : today i live in country where people are allowed to express their innermost feelings and fears without being ostracised .
i live in a country where citizens have the democratic right to vote .
i live in a country with one of the best constitutions in the world , in a country whose government beholds the freedom of the press as a bulwark of democracy .
having a vote did n't necessarily put food in the bellies of the impoverished citizens , but it gave some of them a roof over their heads , running water and - hope .
walking around freely without a pass might not seem that significant to you , cath , but what i experience every day is certainly not visions of a country ' falling apart ' .
wake up , come back and experience the smell of a south africa in bloom .
almari wessels , stellenbosch , south africa i am truly proud of the rainbow nation and what it has achieved in such a short space of time guy , london
