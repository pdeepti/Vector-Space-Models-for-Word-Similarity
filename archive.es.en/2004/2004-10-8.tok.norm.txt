"
the crowds were so large that security officials rushed the germans out through a side entrance to their waiting bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bierhoff " that was wonderful ; it 's fantastic to get a welcome like that when you 're the visiting side , " german team manager oliver bierhoff told reporters .
" i 've never seen anything like this , " defender christian wörms said .
" this is just overwhelming . " the euphoria is not hard to understand .
though ireland played a world qualifier in tehran in 2001 and asian teams are regular visitors , saturday 's friendly marks the first time a major soccer power has visited the country since the iranian revolution in 1979 . " it 's the biggest event for the fans since over 30 years , " branko ivankovic , the croatian trainer of iran 's soccer team said .
" you can see how important the game is . " tehran in a tizzy excitement has been mounting in tehran over the past days with the city 's 14 daily newspapers filling their pages with coverage and background on saturday 's game .
tehran 's azadi stadium is expected to be filled to tight capacity with an estimated 10,000 fans . on thursday , the frenzy was palpable at a chaotic press conference attended by the two sides at the german team 's hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann amid a swamp of journalists , security personnel and cameras , german coach jürgen klinsmann , who created a stir when he spontaneously whisked off his players for a sightseeing tour of the shah 's palace instead of a training session , said " that 's how you get a feeling of where you are .
it was really great fun . " germans mean business but the 40-year-old klinsmann , who has ruffled a few feathers in german soccer circles with his unconventional ideas , made it clear that his team meant business . " we 've come here to win .
for us it 's a further important test for 2006 and we want to win it , " klinsmann said .
" and the team that 's here is confident of that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm in action during the germany-austria game klinsmann has already included several youngsters in the team that will play saturday .
among them are aston villa 's 22-year-old midfielder thomas hitzlsperger , chelsea 's robert huth , 20 , vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm -lrb- photo -rrb- , 20 , and 22-year-old andreas hinkel .
" they will get a taste of what awaits them and will see whether they can come through it , " klinsmann said . germany , who have won the world cup three times , will host the world cup in 2006 and thus automatically qualify .
in past weeks , a 3-1 win over austria followed by a creditable 1-1 draw against brazil have boosted the team 's morale . " we have made strides forward in the matches against austria and brazil and want to take another step in the right direction , " klinsmann said . sports mingles with politics but for iran , saturday 's game is a slightly different story . coach ivankovic has said the game " comes at an unfortunate time . "
iran plays a decisive world cup qualification match against qatar on wednesday : a victory would take it a round further to qualifying for its third world cup .
in terms of its significance , the friendly with germany pales in comparision . " the players have to concentrate on wednesday 's game against qatar , " ivankovic said . despite the mass enthusiasm for the sport , soccer in iran is also linked to politics and the wills of the clergy .
since passion for soccer runs high in the country and has the capacity to mobilize thousands on the street , iran 's religious leaders tend to view it as a danger to the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian fights for the ball the country 's leadership has also exerted pressure on its players living abroad to toe their line .
striker vahid hashemian passed up a tour with bayern munich to tel aviv because iran forbids contacts with israel .
the official explanation by hashemian was that he had injured his back . hashemian has since returned to the iranian national soccer team and will play against germany on saturday .
" the people in iran should n't have the impression that i do n't want to play for our country , " he said at the press conference . hashemian has also pointed to iran 's soccer potential .
" iran has 70 million inhabitants , 13 million alone live in tehran .
soccer is played on every street , " hashemian said .
" we have the potential to be the best team in asia . " female iranian fans banned some are hoping saturday 's match might even have positive ramifications beyond sport borders . german team manager oliver bierhoff said he hoped the game would promote international relations between iran and germany , which have soured because of iran 's refusal to comply with the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on its uranium-enrichment related activities . " we can show sport is a way to connect people , especially with regard to problematic issues in islamic countries , " bierhoff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play soccer in a park in tehran but , iranian authorities don ’ t seem to share the view .

tehran 's azadi stadium is expected to be filled to tight capacity with an estimated 10,000 fans . on thursday , the frenzy was palpable at a chaotic press conference attended by the two sides at the german team 's hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann amid a swamp of journalists , security personnel and cameras , german coach jürgen klinsmann , who created a stir when he spontaneously whisked off his players for a sightseeing tour of the shah 's palace instead of a training session , said " that 's how you get a feeling of where you are .
it was really great fun . " germans mean business but the 40-year-old klinsmann , who has ruffled a few feathers in german soccer circles with his unconventional ideas , made it clear that his team meant business . " we 've come here to win .
for us it 's a further important test for 2006 and we want to win it , " klinsmann said .
" and the team that 's here is confident of that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm in action during the germany-austria game klinsmann has already included several youngsters in the team that will play saturday .
among them are aston villa 's 22-year-old midfielder thomas hitzlsperger , chelsea 's robert huth , 20 , vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm -lrb- photo -rrb- , 20 , and 22-year-old andreas hinkel .
" they will get a taste of what awaits them and will see whether they can come through it , " klinsmann said . germany , who have won the world cup three times , will host the world cup in 2006 and thus automatically qualify .
in past weeks , a 3-1 win over austria followed by a creditable 1-1 draw against brazil have boosted the team 's morale . " we have made strides forward in the matches against austria and brazil and want to take another step in the right direction , " klinsmann said . sports mingles with politics but for iran , saturday 's game is a slightly different story . coach ivankovic has said the game " comes at an unfortunate time . "
iran plays a decisive world cup qualification match against qatar on wednesday : a victory would take it a round further to qualifying for its third world cup .
in terms of its significance , the friendly with germany pales in comparision . " the players have to concentrate on wednesday 's game against qatar , " ivankovic said . despite the mass enthusiasm for the sport , soccer in iran is also linked to politics and the wills of the clergy .
since passion for soccer runs high in the country and has the capacity to mobilize thousands on the street , iran 's religious leaders tend to view it as a danger to the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian fights for the ball the country 's leadership has also exerted pressure on its players living abroad to toe their line .
striker vahid hashemian passed up a tour with bayern munich to tel aviv because iran forbids contacts with israel .
the official explanation by hashemian was that he had injured his back . hashemian has since returned to the iranian national soccer team and will play against germany on saturday .
" the people in iran should n't have the impression that i do n't want to play for our country , " he said at the press conference . hashemian has also pointed to iran 's soccer potential .
" iran has 70 million inhabitants , 13 million alone live in tehran .
soccer is played on every street , " hashemian said .
" we have the potential to be the best team in asia . " female iranian fans banned some are hoping saturday 's match might even have positive ramifications beyond sport borders . german team manager oliver bierhoff said he hoped the game would promote international relations between iran and germany , which have soured because of iran 's refusal to comply with the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on its uranium-enrichment related activities . " we can show sport is a way to connect people , especially with regard to problematic issues in islamic countries , " bierhoff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play soccer in a park in tehran but , iranian authorities don ’ t seem to share the view .
iran 's soccer federation on tuesday upheld a ban on iranian women attending stadiums even though many are the islamic country 's most passionate fans . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kahn rapped for klose attack bayern munich 's german international goalkeeper oliver kahn has come under fire for saturday 's attack on werder bremen striker miroslav klose .

german reinforcements have been sent to faizabad and kunduz in northern afghanistan since mid september , where german troops have already formed two so-called provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prts -rrb- . providing security and information the so-called " election reinforcements , " who are lightly armed with pistols and rifles , are meant to carry out patrols in the area and give the local population a sense of security as elections loom . on election day , the german soldiers are to support the afghan authorities by protecting polling stations , which are to be set up in schools and civic offices .
the soldiers will also help to monitor the transport of the ballots as well as aid in counting votes .
however , in the case of conflict , german troops will only intervene if the afghan army or police explicity ask for help . in addition to bolstering security , germany 's bundeswehr has also been informing the local population about the election via radio and a newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan man stands amongst several tv satellite dishes in downtown kabul , afghanistan .
the radio channel " voice of freedom " which broadcasts seven hours daily is made up of seven afghan journalists under german leadership .
the germans have also set up a newspaper under the same name , which is produced in kabul and includes eight pages on northern afghanistan . the aim of both the radio and newspaper programs is to provide general knowledge and inform the populace of the function and role of elections and thus aid the democratization process . the bundeswehr also has a tank and two trucks outfitted with loudspeakers in the region towards that purpose . according to a bundeswehr spokesman , the voter registration drive in kunduz has met with resounding success .

the 1998 spelling reform was meant to reduce the number of spelling irregularities in german , provide consistent rules for word division and compound words , and decide on the spelling of foreign words absorbed by the language .
however , many people were dissatisfied with the reforms ; several german authors refused to abide by the changes and one of the nation 's top newspapers , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , returned to the old orthography shortly after the reform 's introduction .
now an official " spelling council " will be created , which will include both proponents and opponents of the spelling changes .
they will work together to slightly reform the original reform and as of august 1 , the new spelling system will become mandatory in schools .
until now , students using the old spellings were simply reminded that they were writing words in an " outdated " fashion . dw-world.de german spelling debate reignites german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .

" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .

estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "

but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 literature nobel prize goes to austria 's jelinek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elfriede jelinek 's works often contain harsh social criticism for only the ninth time in the 103-year history of the nobel prize , the award for literature has gone to a woman .
elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

on the site , gary lauck , who has been nicknamed the " farmbelt führer " because his home is in lincoln , nebraska , offers nazi newspapers , pictures of nazi flags and of adolf hitler , and sells other forms of nazi paraphernalia .
it is the latest in germany 's cat-and-mouse game with lauck , who has created a series of web sites with official-sounding web addresses featuring nazi material .
the content on his site breaches german law against the dissemination of nazi material or a revival of nazi ideology .
however , the united states has refused to take action against him .
lauck was deported from germany in 1999 for inciting racial hatred .
the arbitration panel said germany owns the term federal republic of germany as a trademark and can take control of it .
the domain name will be transferred to german control after a 10-day appeal deadline .
lauck did not defend the case . dw-world.de wave of right-wing spam floods germany thursday morning a flood of spam was released on the internet containing german-language right-wing propaganda .
experts say extremists are using a " spambot " to spread their xenophobic messages as widely as possible .

his comments , made in an interview with financial times deutschland , make him the first high-level eu diplomat to publicly say that the barrier has fulfilled its aim .
" the barrier has drastically sunk the number of attacks , " said the belgian diplomat .
however , although he admitted that the number of attacks has fallen , he told ft deutschland that it does not mean that he finds the wall good .
marc otte said that the problems with the wall and international law remain .
the international court of justice has criticised the course of the wall which , in parts , runs over palestinian territory and not along the green line - the pre-1967 border .

output by factories , utilities , construction sites and mines fell by 1 percent from july , the economics and labor ministry in berlin reported .
according to a survey by bloomberg , economists had expected a decline of 0.4 percent .
blamed for the slowdown is this year 's 62 percent rise in oil prices , stubborn unemployment rates and declining demand for exports , a key engine driving germany 's economy .
as europe 's largest economy , its performance has an effect on the entire euro zone and the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , said prospects for growth in the whole euro region are faced with " a good deal of uncertainty " due to high energy costs and depressed consumer spending . more briefs 08.10.2004 -pipe- thyssenkrupp , shipbuilder hdw in merger 08.10.2004 -pipe- german trade surplus shrinks 07.10.2004 -pipe- berlin mulls direct flights to asia and us 07.10.2004 -pipe- germany industry urges corporate tax reform 07.10.2004 -pipe- carmakers most profitable us firms in germany 06.10.2004 -pipe- thyssenkrupp mulls merger with corus 06.10.2004 -pipe- vw sees sharp rise in 2005 profits 05.10.2004 -pipe- adidas sponsors us soccer to boost profile radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .

" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .

" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .

but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .
" aldous huxley put it wonderfully : every person who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves , to multiply the ways in which they exist , to make life full , significant and interesting , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany germany can no longer take the education of its future generations for granted .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .
but dutch citizenship laws do n't allow naturalization after death , according to patricia bosboom , a spokeswoman for the anne frank house in amsterdam . as dutch as you can be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank house , amsterdam " we still view her as dutch , " bosboom said .
" she wrote in dutch ; she thought in dutch .
she was as dutch as you can be . " those sentiments were echoed in frank 's home town of frankfurt am main .
" in her diary , anne frank expressed her longing to become dutch after the war , " susanne wiegmann , managing director of the anne frank youth meeting center there , told dw-world .
even so , anne frank has been dubbed " frankfurt 's most famous daughter , " an analogy to " frankfurt 's most famous son , " johann wolfgang von goethe . as far as the german government is concerned , however , anne frank is german .
" she was german up to her death , since the nazi regime 's denial of citizenship is null and void , " rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman told the german dpa news agency . rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the photograph was taken by her father , otto frank .
" it 's a debate that we can only warn against , " thomas heppener , head of berlin 's anne frank center told dw-world .
" it leads us away from the ideals that anne frank described in her diary . "
heppener was equally critical of the proposal to naturalize frank : " it would amount to retrospectively smoothing out the difficulties of history . " but heppener welcomed the television show 's decision to allow people to vote anne frank a great dutch personality .
" that way you can reach simple people who otherwise would hardly be interested in her fate , " he said . the dutch will have the chance to decide for themselves on oct .
11 at 8:30 p.m. on kanal nederland 1 , when anne frank will compete against the likes of painter vincent van gogh and soccer player johan cruyff for the title of greatest dutch personality . on last year 's " our best - the 100 greatest germans , " anne frank only ranked 134 .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .

heppener was equally critical of the proposal to naturalize frank : " it would amount to retrospectively smoothing out the difficulties of history . " but heppener welcomed the television show 's decision to allow people to vote anne frank a great dutch personality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 the reluctance to read großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these reading children are more the exception than the rule in germany the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .
but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .
" aldous huxley put it wonderfully : every person who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves , to multiply the ways in which they exist , to make life full , significant and interesting , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany germany can no longer take the education of its future generations for granted .

on the site , gary lauck , who has been nicknamed the " farmbelt führer " because his home is in lincoln , nebraska , offers nazi newspapers , pictures of nazi flags and of adolf hitler , and sells other forms of nazi paraphernalia .
it is the latest in germany 's cat-and-mouse game with lauck , who has created a series of web sites with official-sounding web addresses featuring nazi material .
the content on his site breaches german law against the dissemination of nazi material or a revival of nazi ideology .
however , the united states has refused to take action against him .
lauck was deported from germany in 1999 for inciting racial hatred .
the arbitration panel said germany owns the term federal republic of germany as a trademark and can take control of it .
the domain name will be transferred to german control after a 10-day appeal deadline .
lauck did not defend the case . dw-world.de wave of right-wing spam floods germany thursday morning a flood of spam was released on the internet containing german-language right-wing propaganda .
experts say extremists are using a " spambot " to spread their xenophobic messages as widely as possible .

the move follows hard on the heels of henkel filing for antitrust approval to take-over another us gluemaker , orbseal . the clorox deal leaves the düsseldorf-based consumer goods group $ 2.1 billion in cash , ownership of some clorox brands and a stake in a spanish cleaning-products joint venture .

but the inclusion of military-ruled myanmar has riled the europeans and has cast a shadow over the summit . on the day before friday 's official start of the gathering , the asia-europe forum inducted 13 more members into its informal ranks : 10 from europe , three from asia , including myanmar , formerly burma .
the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar . " we should continue the dialogue about human rights in our countries and the universal standards which should be kept .
i expect further improvements from myanmar as a new asem member . " new sanctions as eu leaders gathered in vietnam 's capital hanoi ahead of the meeting , they said that , despite myanmar 's inclusion in the group , the eu would tighten its sanctions against the country after it failed to meet demands by the eu to release suu kyi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi addresses a crowd in december 2002 her party , the national league of democracy , won elections in 1990 by a landslide but they were ignored by the country 's military rulers . " these conditions have not been met .
as a result , the eu will , at a meeting on oct .
11 , impose stricter sanctions on the regime in myanmar , " dutch foreign minister ben bot , who is attending the meeting , said in a statement .
the netherlands currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the sanctions include a visa ban , a prohibition on eu-registered firms from financing state-owned companies in myanmar and voting against international organizations extending loans to the country . " we will be taking the opportunity of the summit to underline - not least to the regime itself - our concerns about the unacceptable situation in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- and its continued lack of progress towards democracy , " british deputy prime minister john prescott said in a statement . strengthening contacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president romano prodi , center , and dutch foreign minister bernard bot , at right , address the media in hanoi .
the summit , asem 's fifth biennial gathering , consists of two days of talks on various issues , such as trade , north korea 's nuclear ambitions , iraq , united nations reform , disease control and cultural diversity . since thursday 's enlargement , the bloc has 39 member countries : 25 from europe , 13 from asia and the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the members represent about 60 percent of world trade and around three billion people .
both asia and europe see the group as a way to promote trade and security . in the wake of the iraq war , france in particular is hoping to position asem as a way of promoting a more " multipolar " agenda regarding world affairs and less dependence on the united states .
asem is one of the few large international groups that does not include the us as a member . china is hoping to convince the eu to lift its arms embargo , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
it has the support of french president jacques chirac , who on friday said the 15-year-old arms embargo on china made no sense .
he indicated that the eu could lift the ban next year despite us objections . human rights concerns play large still , the issue of myanmar and other human rights concerns , such as a crackdown by the vietnamese government on a buddhist group , have threatened to overshadow other topics . as the leaders convened in hanoi , the european parliament called for the immediate and unconditional release of the leaders of the outlawed buddhist church who are being held in detention . in an editorial in thursday 's international herald tribune , suu kyi 's fellow nobel prize winner archbishop desmond tutu accused world leaders of ignoring myanmar 's plight . " there in hanoi , state terrorists from myanmar will sit and dine with you leaders , " he wrote . the eu had originally threatened to boycott the summit rather than sit with myanmar 's leaders , but a compromise was found when the country agreed to send a lower-level delegation . while european leaders have used stern talk with myanmar , its asian neighbors have been more sympathetic of military rulers ' claims that they can not rush democratization nor will they allow outside forces to interfere in what they see as an internal affair . and despite the sometimes forceful language by the europeans in public , reuters obtained a draft final summit statement that suggests the overall group will not mention suu kyi 's name directly at the end of the meeting on saturday . " the leaders welcomed the assurance by myanmar that restrictions placed on specific political parties are provisional , and looked forward to the withdrawal of these restrictions at the earliest time , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .
but dutch citizenship laws do n't allow naturalization after death , according to patricia bosboom , a spokeswoman for the anne frank house in amsterdam . as dutch as you can be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank house , amsterdam " we still view her as dutch , " bosboom said .
" she wrote in dutch ; she thought in dutch .
she was as dutch as you can be . " those sentiments were echoed in frank 's home town of frankfurt am main .
" in her diary , anne frank expressed her longing to become dutch after the war , " susanne wiegmann , managing director of the anne frank youth meeting center there , told dw-world .
even so , anne frank has been dubbed " frankfurt 's most famous daughter , " an analogy to " frankfurt 's most famous son , " johann wolfgang von goethe . as far as the german government is concerned , however , anne frank is german .
" she was german up to her death , since the nazi regime 's denial of citizenship is null and void , " rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman told the german dpa news agency . rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the photograph was taken by her father , otto frank .
" it 's a debate that we can only warn against , " thomas heppener , head of berlin 's anne frank center told dw-world .
" it leads us away from the ideals that anne frank described in her diary . "
heppener was equally critical of the proposal to naturalize frank : " it would amount to retrospectively smoothing out the difficulties of history . " but heppener welcomed the television show 's decision to allow people to vote anne frank a great dutch personality .
" that way you can reach simple people who otherwise would hardly be interested in her fate , " he said . the dutch will have the chance to decide for themselves on oct .
11 at 8:30 p.m. on kanal nederland 1 , when anne frank will compete against the likes of painter vincent van gogh and soccer player johan cruyff for the title of greatest dutch personality . on last year 's " our best - the 100 greatest germans , " anne frank only ranked 134 .

the attack came a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . the rocket exploded early friday in the parking lot of a building next to the german embassy where journalists can get accredited for the polls , according to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . no one was injured in the attack , which came ahead of saturday 's presidential elections that militants of the former fundamentalist islamic taliban regime have vowed to disrupt . several embassies , including that of the united states as well as isaf headquarters and the united nations building are in the area where the blast occurred . supporting democratization process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder inspects german peacekeepers during his vist to the isaf base in kabul in may , 2002 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is to scheduled to visit afghanistan after attending the asem conference in the vietnamese capital of hanoi on friday , will go ahead with his plans . " chancellor schröder made it clear that he will stick to his plans , " the chancellor 's spokesman , bela anda told journalists .
" we are assessing the security situation very carefully , " anda added .
" we do n't know many details about the background of the attack but it was obviously aimed at disrupting the election process . " schröder is slated to visit isaf headquarters in kabul as well as hold talks with afghan president hamid karzai and german peacekeepers and civilian reconstruction workers . anda pointed out that more than 2,000 german isaf soldiers as well as civilian helpers are currently stationed in afghanistan and uzbekistan .
that 's why schröder " is determined to travel there , " he said and added that schröder wanted to support the democratization process in afghanistan with his visit a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . germans stay on another year security has been a huge concern in the run-up to the afghan elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , right , patrols together with an afghan policeman as children wave to them in kabul , afghanistan , in jan .
2002 .
near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks in the country since august last year . nato general secretary de hoop scheffer has not ruled out attacks taking place during saturday 's elections .
" naturally , nato is not in a position to stop every saboteur who wants to create chaos .
that would be going too far , " de hoop scheffer said in berlin .
germany is one of the largest contributors to the multinational isaf force in afghanistan . the german parliament , which last week , extended the troops ' mandate by another year , also agreed that german soldiers would be deployed outside the capital of kabul to secure the elections .
german reinforcements have been sent to faizabad and kunduz in northern afghanistan since mid september , where german troops have already formed two so-called provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prts -rrb- . providing security and information the so-called " election reinforcements , " who are lightly armed with pistols and rifles , are meant to carry out patrols in the area and give the local population a sense of security as elections loom . on election day , the german soldiers are to support the afghan authorities by protecting polling stations , which are to be set up in schools and civic offices .
the soldiers will also help to monitor the transport of the ballots as well as aid in counting votes .
however , in the case of conflict , german troops will only intervene if the afghan army or police explicity ask for help . in addition to bolstering security , germany 's bundeswehr has also been informing the local population about the election via radio and a newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan man stands amongst several tv satellite dishes in downtown kabul , afghanistan .
the radio channel " voice of freedom " which broadcasts seven hours daily is made up of seven afghan journalists under german leadership .
the germans have also set up a newspaper under the same name , which is produced in kabul and includes eight pages on northern afghanistan . the aim of both the radio and newspaper programs is to provide general knowledge and inform the populace of the function and role of elections and thus aid the democratization process . the bundeswehr also has a tank and two trucks outfitted with loudspeakers in the region towards that purpose . according to a bundeswehr spokesman , the voter registration drive in kunduz has met with resounding success .

but the inclusion of military-ruled myanmar has riled the europeans and has cast a shadow over the summit . on the day before friday 's official start of the gathering , the asia-europe forum inducted 13 more members into its informal ranks : 10 from europe , three from asia , including myanmar , formerly burma .
the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar . " we should continue the dialogue about human rights in our countries and the universal standards which should be kept .
i expect further improvements from myanmar as a new asem member . " new sanctions as eu leaders gathered in vietnam 's capital hanoi ahead of the meeting , they said that , despite myanmar 's inclusion in the group , the eu would tighten its sanctions against the country after it failed to meet demands by the eu to release suu kyi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi addresses a crowd in december 2002 her party , the national league of democracy , won elections in 1990 by a landslide but they were ignored by the country 's military rulers . " these conditions have not been met .
as a result , the eu will , at a meeting on oct .
11 , impose stricter sanctions on the regime in myanmar , " dutch foreign minister ben bot , who is attending the meeting , said in a statement .
the netherlands currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the sanctions include a visa ban , a prohibition on eu-registered firms from financing state-owned companies in myanmar and voting against international organizations extending loans to the country . " we will be taking the opportunity of the summit to underline - not least to the regime itself - our concerns about the unacceptable situation in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- and its continued lack of progress towards democracy , " british deputy prime minister john prescott said in a statement . strengthening contacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president romano prodi , center , and dutch foreign minister bernard bot , at right , address the media in hanoi .
the summit , asem 's fifth biennial gathering , consists of two days of talks on various issues , such as trade , north korea 's nuclear ambitions , iraq , united nations reform , disease control and cultural diversity . since thursday 's enlargement , the bloc has 39 member countries : 25 from europe , 13 from asia and the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the members represent about 60 percent of world trade and around three billion people .
both asia and europe see the group as a way to promote trade and security . in the wake of the iraq war , france in particular is hoping to position asem as a way of promoting a more " multipolar " agenda regarding world affairs and less dependence on the united states .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .

but the inclusion of military-ruled myanmar has riled the europeans and has cast a shadow over the summit . on the day before friday 's official start of the gathering , the asia-europe forum inducted 13 more members into its informal ranks : 10 from europe , three from asia , including myanmar , formerly burma .
the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar . " we should continue the dialogue about human rights in our countries and the universal standards which should be kept .
i expect further improvements from myanmar as a new asem member . " new sanctions as eu leaders gathered in vietnam 's capital hanoi ahead of the meeting , they said that , despite myanmar 's inclusion in the group , the eu would tighten its sanctions against the country after it failed to meet demands by the eu to release suu kyi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi addresses a crowd in december 2002 her party , the national league of democracy , won elections in 1990 by a landslide but they were ignored by the country 's military rulers . " these conditions have not been met .
as a result , the eu will , at a meeting on oct .
11 , impose stricter sanctions on the regime in myanmar , " dutch foreign minister ben bot , who is attending the meeting , said in a statement .
the netherlands currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the sanctions include a visa ban , a prohibition on eu-registered firms from financing state-owned companies in myanmar and voting against international organizations extending loans to the country . " we will be taking the opportunity of the summit to underline - not least to the regime itself - our concerns about the unacceptable situation in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- and its continued lack of progress towards democracy , " british deputy prime minister john prescott said in a statement . strengthening contacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president romano prodi , center , and dutch foreign minister bernard bot , at right , address the media in hanoi .
the summit , asem 's fifth biennial gathering , consists of two days of talks on various issues , such as trade , north korea 's nuclear ambitions , iraq , united nations reform , disease control and cultural diversity . since thursday 's enlargement , the bloc has 39 member countries : 25 from europe , 13 from asia and the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the members represent about 60 percent of world trade and around three billion people .
both asia and europe see the group as a way to promote trade and security . in the wake of the iraq war , france in particular is hoping to position asem as a way of promoting a more " multipolar " agenda regarding world affairs and less dependence on the united states .
asem is one of the few large international groups that does not include the us as a member . china is hoping to convince the eu to lift its arms embargo , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
it has the support of french president jacques chirac , who on friday said the 15-year-old arms embargo on china made no sense .

the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar . " we should continue the dialogue about human rights in our countries and the universal standards which should be kept .
i expect further improvements from myanmar as a new asem member . " new sanctions as eu leaders gathered in vietnam 's capital hanoi ahead of the meeting , they said that , despite myanmar 's inclusion in the group , the eu would tighten its sanctions against the country after it failed to meet demands by the eu to release suu kyi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi addresses a crowd in december 2002 her party , the national league of democracy , won elections in 1990 by a landslide but they were ignored by the country 's military rulers . " these conditions have not been met .
as a result , the eu will , at a meeting on oct .
11 , impose stricter sanctions on the regime in myanmar , " dutch foreign minister ben bot , who is attending the meeting , said in a statement .
the netherlands currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the sanctions include a visa ban , a prohibition on eu-registered firms from financing state-owned companies in myanmar and voting against international organizations extending loans to the country . " we will be taking the opportunity of the summit to underline - not least to the regime itself - our concerns about the unacceptable situation in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- and its continued lack of progress towards democracy , " british deputy prime minister john prescott said in a statement . strengthening contacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president romano prodi , center , and dutch foreign minister bernard bot , at right , address the media in hanoi .
the summit , asem 's fifth biennial gathering , consists of two days of talks on various issues , such as trade , north korea 's nuclear ambitions , iraq , united nations reform , disease control and cultural diversity . since thursday 's enlargement , the bloc has 39 member countries : 25 from europe , 13 from asia and the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the members represent about 60 percent of world trade and around three billion people .
both asia and europe see the group as a way to promote trade and security . in the wake of the iraq war , france in particular is hoping to position asem as a way of promoting a more " multipolar " agenda regarding world affairs and less dependence on the united states .
asem is one of the few large international groups that does not include the us as a member . china is hoping to convince the eu to lift its arms embargo , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
it has the support of french president jacques chirac , who on friday said the 15-year-old arms embargo on china made no sense .
he indicated that the eu could lift the ban next year despite us objections . human rights concerns play large still , the issue of myanmar and other human rights concerns , such as a crackdown by the vietnamese government on a buddhist group , have threatened to overshadow other topics . as the leaders convened in hanoi , the european parliament called for the immediate and unconditional release of the leaders of the outlawed buddhist church who are being held in detention . in an editorial in thursday 's international herald tribune , suu kyi 's fellow nobel prize winner archbishop desmond tutu accused world leaders of ignoring myanmar 's plight . " there in hanoi , state terrorists from myanmar will sit and dine with you leaders , " he wrote . the eu had originally threatened to boycott the summit rather than sit with myanmar 's leaders , but a compromise was found when the country agreed to send a lower-level delegation . while european leaders have used stern talk with myanmar , its asian neighbors have been more sympathetic of military rulers ' claims that they can not rush democratization nor will they allow outside forces to interfere in what they see as an internal affair . and despite the sometimes forceful language by the europeans in public , reuters obtained a draft final summit statement that suggests the overall group will not mention suu kyi 's name directly at the end of the meeting on saturday . " the leaders welcomed the assurance by myanmar that restrictions placed on specific political parties are provisional , and looked forward to the withdrawal of these restrictions at the earliest time , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .
during his visit to brussels the chinese premier will also focus on eu-china trade issues .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .
“ we continue to see traces of his activity .
he tries to organize , to motivate ” his followers , hanning said further .
but he didn ’ t elaborate . german intelligence officials continue to believe that bin laden is living in the afghan-pakistani border area , hanning said . the us-led invasion of iraq and repeated terror attacks are becoming a spiral of violence is pushing the country toward “ a crossroads . ”
this could end in total chaos , hanning said . ' terrorist breeding ground ' “ if we have a space there with no government authority , i fear that iraq would become a breeding ground for terrorism , ” hanning told reporters . it is “ by no means sure ” that iraq will achieve the transition toward stable democracy , the goal for the region set by us president george w. bush . during the conference , german interior minister otto schily sent a strong message to washington when he said “ whoever responds to violence only with violence ” was doomed to fail , the associated press reported . but despite germany ’ s running opposition to the us led action in iraq , hanning told the conference that at this point , all the countries now have a stake in iraq ’ s future . “ all of us have a common interest , whether we take part in the us-led coalition in iraq or not , ” hanning said .
“ this country must be stabilized . ” worry over weapons experts hanning stressed his concern about the pool of iraqi scientists who worked on saddam 's weapons programs , especially since there is evidence that al qaeda was working to obtain biological and chemical weapons . there is currently no evidence that islamic extremists have tried to link up with saddam 's former scientists .
still , “ we are concerned , ” he said .
the scientists “ are still around , in iraq , jordan or in other neighboring countries , ” he said . “ what happens with these weapons experts ' knowledge ?

"
the crowds were so large that security officials rushed the germans out through a side entrance to their waiting bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bierhoff " that was wonderful ; it 's fantastic to get a welcome like that when you 're the visiting side , " german team manager oliver bierhoff told reporters .
" i 've never seen anything like this , " defender christian wörms said .
" this is just overwhelming . " the euphoria is not hard to understand .
though ireland played a world qualifier in tehran in 2001 and asian teams are regular visitors , saturday 's friendly marks the first time a major soccer power has visited the country since the iranian revolution in 1979 . " it 's the biggest event for the fans since over 30 years , " branko ivankovic , the croatian trainer of iran 's soccer team said .
" you can see how important the game is . " tehran in a tizzy excitement has been mounting in tehran over the past days with the city 's 14 daily newspapers filling their pages with coverage and background on saturday 's game .
tehran 's azadi stadium is expected to be filled to tight capacity with an estimated 10,000 fans . on thursday , the frenzy was palpable at a chaotic press conference attended by the two sides at the german team 's hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann amid a swamp of journalists , security personnel and cameras , german coach jürgen klinsmann , who created a stir when he spontaneously whisked off his players for a sightseeing tour of the shah 's palace instead of a training session , said " that 's how you get a feeling of where you are .
it was really great fun . " germans mean business but the 40-year-old klinsmann , who has ruffled a few feathers in german soccer circles with his unconventional ideas , made it clear that his team meant business . " we 've come here to win .
for us it 's a further important test for 2006 and we want to win it , " klinsmann said .
" and the team that 's here is confident of that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm in action during the germany-austria game klinsmann has already included several youngsters in the team that will play saturday .
among them are aston villa 's 22-year-old midfielder thomas hitzlsperger , chelsea 's robert huth , 20 , vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm -lrb- photo -rrb- , 20 , and 22-year-old andreas hinkel .
" they will get a taste of what awaits them and will see whether they can come through it , " klinsmann said . germany , who have won the world cup three times , will host the world cup in 2006 and thus automatically qualify .
in past weeks , a 3-1 win over austria followed by a creditable 1-1 draw against brazil have boosted the team 's morale . " we have made strides forward in the matches against austria and brazil and want to take another step in the right direction , " klinsmann said . sports mingles with politics but for iran , saturday 's game is a slightly different story . coach ivankovic has said the game " comes at an unfortunate time . "
iran plays a decisive world cup qualification match against qatar on wednesday : a victory would take it a round further to qualifying for its third world cup .
in terms of its significance , the friendly with germany pales in comparision . " the players have to concentrate on wednesday 's game against qatar , " ivankovic said . despite the mass enthusiasm for the sport , soccer in iran is also linked to politics and the wills of the clergy .
since passion for soccer runs high in the country and has the capacity to mobilize thousands on the street , iran 's religious leaders tend to view it as a danger to the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian fights for the ball the country 's leadership has also exerted pressure on its players living abroad to toe their line .
striker vahid hashemian passed up a tour with bayern munich to tel aviv because iran forbids contacts with israel .
the official explanation by hashemian was that he had injured his back . hashemian has since returned to the iranian national soccer team and will play against germany on saturday .
" the people in iran should n't have the impression that i do n't want to play for our country , " he said at the press conference . hashemian has also pointed to iran 's soccer potential .
" iran has 70 million inhabitants , 13 million alone live in tehran .
soccer is played on every street , " hashemian said .
" we have the potential to be the best team in asia . " female iranian fans banned some are hoping saturday 's match might even have positive ramifications beyond sport borders . german team manager oliver bierhoff said he hoped the game would promote international relations between iran and germany , which have soured because of iran 's refusal to comply with the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on its uranium-enrichment related activities . " we can show sport is a way to connect people , especially with regard to problematic issues in islamic countries , " bierhoff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play soccer in a park in tehran but , iranian authorities don ’ t seem to share the view .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .
but dutch citizenship laws do n't allow naturalization after death , according to patricia bosboom , a spokeswoman for the anne frank house in amsterdam . as dutch as you can be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank house , amsterdam " we still view her as dutch , " bosboom said .
" she wrote in dutch ; she thought in dutch .
she was as dutch as you can be . " those sentiments were echoed in frank 's home town of frankfurt am main .
" in her diary , anne frank expressed her longing to become dutch after the war , " susanne wiegmann , managing director of the anne frank youth meeting center there , told dw-world .
even so , anne frank has been dubbed " frankfurt 's most famous daughter , " an analogy to " frankfurt 's most famous son , " johann wolfgang von goethe . as far as the german government is concerned , however , anne frank is german .
" she was german up to her death , since the nazi regime 's denial of citizenship is null and void , " rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman told the german dpa news agency . rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the photograph was taken by her father , otto frank .
" it 's a debate that we can only warn against , " thomas heppener , head of berlin 's anne frank center told dw-world .
" it leads us away from the ideals that anne frank described in her diary . "
heppener was equally critical of the proposal to naturalize frank : " it would amount to retrospectively smoothing out the difficulties of history . " but heppener welcomed the television show 's decision to allow people to vote anne frank a great dutch personality .
" that way you can reach simple people who otherwise would hardly be interested in her fate , " he said . the dutch will have the chance to decide for themselves on oct .
11 at 8:30 p.m. on kanal nederland 1 , when anne frank will compete against the likes of painter vincent van gogh and soccer player johan cruyff for the title of greatest dutch personality . on last year 's " our best - the 100 greatest germans , " anne frank only ranked 134 .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .

she was honored for her contribution towards sustainable development , peace and democracy . wangari maathai , 64 , kenyan deputy environment minister , is the first african woman to win the nobel peace prize and the seventh african since it was first awarded in1901 . previous winners from africa include un secretary-general kofi anan , who shared the prize with the un in 2001 , and nelson mandela and f.w. de klerk from south africa in 1993 . " thank you so much , i am so surprised , " maathai told norwegian state television on friday after her victory was disclosed in oslo .
" i am absolutely overwhelmed and very emotionally charged , really .
i did not expect this . " " an inspiration in africa " in its citation , the norwegian nobel committee said maathai had taken a holistic approach to sustainable development in kenya and africa that embraces democracy , human rights and women 's rights in particular .
" she thinks globally and acts locally , " the committee said . it also singled out maathai 's courageous stance against the former oppressive kenyan regime , her grass-roots development project " the green belt movement " that encompasses family planning , nutrition and the fight against corruption and her efforts in countering desertification . " her methods have been adopted by other countries as well .
we are all witness to how deforestation and forest loss have led to desertification in africa and threatened many other regions of the world - in europe too .
protecting forests against desertification is a vital factor in the struggle to strengthen the living environment of our common earth , " the committee said .
" she represents an example and a source of inspiration for everyone in africa fighting for sustainable development , democracy and peace . " more than 25 million trees planted born in april 1940 , maathai was the first woman in east and central africa to earn a doctorate degree .
she studied in the us , in kansas and pittsburgh . maathai , who earned the nickname " mama mici " or mother of trees , began to mobilize and convince women to plant trees in around the kenyan capital of nairobi at the end of the 1970s .
the forests in the area were ravaged after large-scale logging and cutting down of trees to gain firewood for cooking . her " green belt movement " was a tremendous success , with the group planting more than 25 million trees to date across africa .
maathai and her " green belt movement " have won numerous international awards and her environmental work has been emulated in several other african countries . fight for democratic rights but , even beyond her efforts to preserve the environment , maathai has been tireless in her fight for democratic and social rights .
she has also founded a pan-african women 's movement . she has often crossed paths with kenya 's former repressive regime for her convictions and her support for freedom of expression for opposition groups .
persecuted and arrested half a dozen times , maathai was even roughed up by security forces . in december 2002 , maathai tasted her first political success when a rainbow coalition of opposition parties unseated the government of daniel arap moi .

" i am absolutely overwhelmed and very emotionally charged , really .
i did not expect this . " " an inspiration in africa " in its citation , the norwegian nobel committee said maathai had taken a holistic approach to sustainable development in kenya and africa that embraces democracy , human rights and women 's rights in particular .

" her methods have been adopted by other countries as well .
we are all witness to how deforestation and forest loss have led to desertification in africa and threatened many other regions of the world - in europe too .
protecting forests against desertification is a vital factor in the struggle to strengthen the living environment of our common earth , " the committee said .
" she represents an example and a source of inspiration for everyone in africa fighting for sustainable development , democracy and peace . " more than 25 million trees planted born in april 1940 , maathai was the first woman in east and central africa to earn a doctorate degree .

the forests in the area were ravaged after large-scale logging and cutting down of trees to gain firewood for cooking . her " green belt movement " was a tremendous success , with the group planting more than 25 million trees to date across africa .
maathai and her " green belt movement " have won numerous international awards and her environmental work has been emulated in several other african countries . fight for democratic rights but , even beyond her efforts to preserve the environment , maathai has been tireless in her fight for democratic and social rights .
she has also founded a pan-african women 's movement . she has often crossed paths with kenya 's former repressive regime for her convictions and her support for freedom of expression for opposition groups .
persecuted and arrested half a dozen times , maathai was even roughed up by security forces . in december 2002 , maathai tasted her first political success when a rainbow coalition of opposition parties unseated the government of daniel arap moi .
maathai was elected to the parliament and named deputy environment minister by president mwai kibaki . on friday , maathai underlined the importance of her work .
" the environment is very important in the aspects of peace because when we destroy our resources and our resources become scarce , we fight over that , " she told norwegian television . germany welcomes honor for maathai the awarding of the nobel peace prize to maathai on friday has been hailed in germany by politicians , particularly of the green party . german president horst köhler wrote a telegram congratulating her " decade-long engagement in preserving an intact environment " and her fight to uphold human rights in africa .
" life in a healthy environment is one of the most basic human rights .
her fight for it has earned my deepest respect , " köhler wrote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer of germany 's green party said he was " especially happy " because maathai 's efforts to protect the environment had been recognized .
environment minister jürgen trittin described matthai as a " internationally-recognized brilliant environmentalist " who had " decisively improved the conditions for peace in the 21st century . " uschi eid , germany 's federal commissioner for africa in the development ministry , said maathai " is a symbol and a model for the women in africa who advocate preserving nature , maintaining peace and upholding equality . " deputy general secretary of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , dorothea rüland , said she welcomed the fact that " such a committed and brave woman " had won the prize .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .
but dutch citizenship laws do n't allow naturalization after death , according to patricia bosboom , a spokeswoman for the anne frank house in amsterdam . as dutch as you can be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank house , amsterdam " we still view her as dutch , " bosboom said .
" she wrote in dutch ; she thought in dutch .
she was as dutch as you can be . " those sentiments were echoed in frank 's home town of frankfurt am main .
" in her diary , anne frank expressed her longing to become dutch after the war , " susanne wiegmann , managing director of the anne frank youth meeting center there , told dw-world .
even so , anne frank has been dubbed " frankfurt 's most famous daughter , " an analogy to " frankfurt 's most famous son , " johann wolfgang von goethe . as far as the german government is concerned , however , anne frank is german .
" she was german up to her death , since the nazi regime 's denial of citizenship is null and void , " rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman told the german dpa news agency . rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the photograph was taken by her father , otto frank .
" it 's a debate that we can only warn against , " thomas heppener , head of berlin 's anne frank center told dw-world .
" it leads us away from the ideals that anne frank described in her diary . "
heppener was equally critical of the proposal to naturalize frank : " it would amount to retrospectively smoothing out the difficulties of history . " but heppener welcomed the television show 's decision to allow people to vote anne frank a great dutch personality .
" that way you can reach simple people who otherwise would hardly be interested in her fate , " he said . the dutch will have the chance to decide for themselves on oct .
11 at 8:30 p.m. on kanal nederland 1 , when anne frank will compete against the likes of painter vincent van gogh and soccer player johan cruyff for the title of greatest dutch personality . on last year 's " our best - the 100 greatest germans , " anne frank only ranked 134 .

" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .

this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .

estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .
“ we continue to see traces of his activity .
he tries to organize , to motivate ” his followers , hanning said further .
but he didn ’ t elaborate . german intelligence officials continue to believe that bin laden is living in the afghan-pakistani border area , hanning said . the us-led invasion of iraq and repeated terror attacks are becoming a spiral of violence is pushing the country toward “ a crossroads . ”
this could end in total chaos , hanning said . ' terrorist breeding ground ' “ if we have a space there with no government authority , i fear that iraq would become a breeding ground for terrorism , ” hanning told reporters . it is “ by no means sure ” that iraq will achieve the transition toward stable democracy , the goal for the region set by us president george w. bush . during the conference , german interior minister otto schily sent a strong message to washington when he said “ whoever responds to violence only with violence ” was doomed to fail , the associated press reported . but despite germany ’ s running opposition to the us led action in iraq , hanning told the conference that at this point , all the countries now have a stake in iraq ’ s future . “ all of us have a common interest , whether we take part in the us-led coalition in iraq or not , ” hanning said .
“ this country must be stabilized . ” worry over weapons experts hanning stressed his concern about the pool of iraqi scientists who worked on saddam 's weapons programs , especially since there is evidence that al qaeda was working to obtain biological and chemical weapons . there is currently no evidence that islamic extremists have tried to link up with saddam 's former scientists .
still , “ we are concerned , ” he said .
the scientists “ are still around , in iraq , jordan or in other neighboring countries , ” he said . “ what happens with these weapons experts ' knowledge ?
who will put this knowledge to use ?

"
the crowds were so large that security officials rushed the germans out through a side entrance to their waiting bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bierhoff " that was wonderful ; it 's fantastic to get a welcome like that when you 're the visiting side , " german team manager oliver bierhoff told reporters .
" i 've never seen anything like this , " defender christian wörms said .
" this is just overwhelming . " the euphoria is not hard to understand .
though ireland played a world qualifier in tehran in 2001 and asian teams are regular visitors , saturday 's friendly marks the first time a major soccer power has visited the country since the iranian revolution in 1979 . " it 's the biggest event for the fans since over 30 years , " branko ivankovic , the croatian trainer of iran 's soccer team said .
" you can see how important the game is . " tehran in a tizzy excitement has been mounting in tehran over the past days with the city 's 14 daily newspapers filling their pages with coverage and background on saturday 's game .
tehran 's azadi stadium is expected to be filled to tight capacity with an estimated 10,000 fans . on thursday , the frenzy was palpable at a chaotic press conference attended by the two sides at the german team 's hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann amid a swamp of journalists , security personnel and cameras , german coach jürgen klinsmann , who created a stir when he spontaneously whisked off his players for a sightseeing tour of the shah 's palace instead of a training session , said " that 's how you get a feeling of where you are .

for us it 's a further important test for 2006 and we want to win it , " klinsmann said .
" and the team that 's here is confident of that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm in action during the germany-austria game klinsmann has already included several youngsters in the team that will play saturday .
among them are aston villa 's 22-year-old midfielder thomas hitzlsperger , chelsea 's robert huth , 20 , vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm -lrb- photo -rrb- , 20 , and 22-year-old andreas hinkel .
" they will get a taste of what awaits them and will see whether they can come through it , " klinsmann said . germany , who have won the world cup three times , will host the world cup in 2006 and thus automatically qualify .
in past weeks , a 3-1 win over austria followed by a creditable 1-1 draw against brazil have boosted the team 's morale .

"
iran plays a decisive world cup qualification match against qatar on wednesday : a victory would take it a round further to qualifying for its third world cup .
in terms of its significance , the friendly with germany pales in comparision . " the players have to concentrate on wednesday 's game against qatar , " ivankovic said . despite the mass enthusiasm for the sport , soccer in iran is also linked to politics and the wills of the clergy .
since passion for soccer runs high in the country and has the capacity to mobilize thousands on the street , iran 's religious leaders tend to view it as a danger to the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian fights for the ball the country 's leadership has also exerted pressure on its players living abroad to toe their line .
striker vahid hashemian passed up a tour with bayern munich to tel aviv because iran forbids contacts with israel .
the official explanation by hashemian was that he had injured his back . hashemian has since returned to the iranian national soccer team and will play against germany on saturday .
" the people in iran should n't have the impression that i do n't want to play for our country , " he said at the press conference . hashemian has also pointed to iran 's soccer potential .
" iran has 70 million inhabitants , 13 million alone live in tehran .
soccer is played on every street , " hashemian said .
" we have the potential to be the best team in asia . " female iranian fans banned some are hoping saturday 's match might even have positive ramifications beyond sport borders . german team manager oliver bierhoff said he hoped the game would promote international relations between iran and germany , which have soured because of iran 's refusal to comply with the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on its uranium-enrichment related activities . " we can show sport is a way to connect people , especially with regard to problematic issues in islamic countries , " bierhoff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play soccer in a park in tehran but , iranian authorities don ’ t seem to share the view .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .
“ we continue to see traces of his activity .
he tries to organize , to motivate ” his followers , hanning said further .
but he didn ’ t elaborate . german intelligence officials continue to believe that bin laden is living in the afghan-pakistani border area , hanning said . the us-led invasion of iraq and repeated terror attacks are becoming a spiral of violence is pushing the country toward “ a crossroads . ”
this could end in total chaos , hanning said . ' terrorist breeding ground ' “ if we have a space there with no government authority , i fear that iraq would become a breeding ground for terrorism , ” hanning told reporters . it is “ by no means sure ” that iraq will achieve the transition toward stable democracy , the goal for the region set by us president george w. bush . during the conference , german interior minister otto schily sent a strong message to washington when he said “ whoever responds to violence only with violence ” was doomed to fail , the associated press reported . but despite germany ’ s running opposition to the us led action in iraq , hanning told the conference that at this point , all the countries now have a stake in iraq ’ s future . “ all of us have a common interest , whether we take part in the us-led coalition in iraq or not , ” hanning said .
“ this country must be stabilized . ” worry over weapons experts hanning stressed his concern about the pool of iraqi scientists who worked on saddam 's weapons programs , especially since there is evidence that al qaeda was working to obtain biological and chemical weapons . there is currently no evidence that islamic extremists have tried to link up with saddam 's former scientists .
still , “ we are concerned , ” he said .
the scientists “ are still around , in iraq , jordan or in other neighboring countries , ” he said . “ what happens with these weapons experts ' knowledge ?
who will put this knowledge to use ?
international terrorism ?

" it 's the biggest event for the fans since over 30 years , " branko ivankovic , the croatian trainer of iran 's soccer team said .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .
“ we continue to see traces of his activity .

but he didn ’ t elaborate . german intelligence officials continue to believe that bin laden is living in the afghan-pakistani border area , hanning said . the us-led invasion of iraq and repeated terror attacks are becoming a spiral of violence is pushing the country toward “ a crossroads . ”
this could end in total chaos , hanning said . ' terrorist breeding ground ' “ if we have a space there with no government authority , i fear that iraq would become a breeding ground for terrorism , ” hanning told reporters . it is “ by no means sure ” that iraq will achieve the transition toward stable democracy , the goal for the region set by us president george w. bush . during the conference , german interior minister otto schily sent a strong message to washington when he said “ whoever responds to violence only with violence ” was doomed to fail , the associated press reported . but despite germany ’ s running opposition to the us led action in iraq , hanning told the conference that at this point , all the countries now have a stake in iraq ’ s future . “ all of us have a common interest , whether we take part in the us-led coalition in iraq or not , ” hanning said .
“ this country must be stabilized . ” worry over weapons experts hanning stressed his concern about the pool of iraqi scientists who worked on saddam 's weapons programs , especially since there is evidence that al qaeda was working to obtain biological and chemical weapons . there is currently no evidence that islamic extremists have tried to link up with saddam 's former scientists .
still , “ we are concerned , ” he said .
the scientists “ are still around , in iraq , jordan or in other neighboring countries , ” he said . “ what happens with these weapons experts ' knowledge ?

the attack came a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . the rocket exploded early friday in the parking lot of a building next to the german embassy where journalists can get accredited for the polls , according to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . no one was injured in the attack , which came ahead of saturday 's presidential elections that militants of the former fundamentalist islamic taliban regime have vowed to disrupt . several embassies , including that of the united states as well as isaf headquarters and the united nations building are in the area where the blast occurred . supporting democratization process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder inspects german peacekeepers during his vist to the isaf base in kabul in may , 2002 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is to scheduled to visit afghanistan after attending the asem conference in the vietnamese capital of hanoi on friday , will go ahead with his plans . " chancellor schröder made it clear that he will stick to his plans , " the chancellor 's spokesman , bela anda told journalists .
" we are assessing the security situation very carefully , " anda added .
" we do n't know many details about the background of the attack but it was obviously aimed at disrupting the election process . " schröder is slated to visit isaf headquarters in kabul as well as hold talks with afghan president hamid karzai and german peacekeepers and civilian reconstruction workers . anda pointed out that more than 2,000 german isaf soldiers as well as civilian helpers are currently stationed in afghanistan and uzbekistan .
that 's why schröder " is determined to travel there , " he said and added that schröder wanted to support the democratization process in afghanistan with his visit a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . germans stay on another year security has been a huge concern in the run-up to the afghan elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , right , patrols together with an afghan policeman as children wave to them in kabul , afghanistan , in jan .
2002 .
near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks in the country since august last year . nato general secretary de hoop scheffer has not ruled out attacks taking place during saturday 's elections .
" naturally , nato is not in a position to stop every saboteur who wants to create chaos .
that would be going too far , " de hoop scheffer said in berlin .
germany is one of the largest contributors to the multinational isaf force in afghanistan . the german parliament , which last week , extended the troops ' mandate by another year , also agreed that german soldiers would be deployed outside the capital of kabul to secure the elections .
german reinforcements have been sent to faizabad and kunduz in northern afghanistan since mid september , where german troops have already formed two so-called provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prts -rrb- . providing security and information the so-called " election reinforcements , " who are lightly armed with pistols and rifles , are meant to carry out patrols in the area and give the local population a sense of security as elections loom . on election day , the german soldiers are to support the afghan authorities by protecting polling stations , which are to be set up in schools and civic offices .
the soldiers will also help to monitor the transport of the ballots as well as aid in counting votes .
however , in the case of conflict , german troops will only intervene if the afghan army or police explicity ask for help . in addition to bolstering security , germany 's bundeswehr has also been informing the local population about the election via radio and a newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan man stands amongst several tv satellite dishes in downtown kabul , afghanistan .
the radio channel " voice of freedom " which broadcasts seven hours daily is made up of seven afghan journalists under german leadership .
the germans have also set up a newspaper under the same name , which is produced in kabul and includes eight pages on northern afghanistan . the aim of both the radio and newspaper programs is to provide general knowledge and inform the populace of the function and role of elections and thus aid the democratization process . the bundeswehr also has a tank and two trucks outfitted with loudspeakers in the region towards that purpose . according to a bundeswehr spokesman , the voter registration drive in kunduz has met with resounding success .

but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .
" aldous huxley put it wonderfully : every person who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves , to multiply the ways in which they exist , to make life full , significant and interesting , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany germany can no longer take the education of its future generations for granted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.10.2004 estonia works to integrate russians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia joined the eu last may , one of ten new entries encouraged by the state , ever more ethnic russians in estonia are trying to shed their outsider status and gain citizenship - but not without debate . nearly a third of estonia 's 1.4 million inhabitants are ethnic russian , the result of post-war “ russification ” policy in the soviet union .
but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .
" estonia is the only country in europe that has had such a vast naturalization process , " paul-eerik rummo , minister of population affairs , said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 literature nobel prize goes to austria 's jelinek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elfriede jelinek 's works often contain harsh social criticism for only the ninth time in the 103-year history of the nobel prize , the award for literature has gone to a woman .
elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .

but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .
but dutch citizenship laws do n't allow naturalization after death , according to patricia bosboom , a spokeswoman for the anne frank house in amsterdam . as dutch as you can be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank house , amsterdam " we still view her as dutch , " bosboom said .
" she wrote in dutch ; she thought in dutch .
she was as dutch as you can be . " those sentiments were echoed in frank 's home town of frankfurt am main .
" in her diary , anne frank expressed her longing to become dutch after the war , " susanne wiegmann , managing director of the anne frank youth meeting center there , told dw-world .
even so , anne frank has been dubbed " frankfurt 's most famous daughter , " an analogy to " frankfurt 's most famous son , " johann wolfgang von goethe . as far as the german government is concerned , however , anne frank is german .
" she was german up to her death , since the nazi regime 's denial of citizenship is null and void , " rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman told the german dpa news agency . rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the photograph was taken by her father , otto frank .
" it 's a debate that we can only warn against , " thomas heppener , head of berlin 's anne frank center told dw-world .
" it leads us away from the ideals that anne frank described in her diary . "
heppener was equally critical of the proposal to naturalize frank : " it would amount to retrospectively smoothing out the difficulties of history . " but heppener welcomed the television show 's decision to allow people to vote anne frank a great dutch personality .
" that way you can reach simple people who otherwise would hardly be interested in her fate , " he said . the dutch will have the chance to decide for themselves on oct .
11 at 8:30 p.m. on kanal nederland 1 , when anne frank will compete against the likes of painter vincent van gogh and soccer player johan cruyff for the title of greatest dutch personality . on last year 's " our best - the 100 greatest germans , " anne frank only ranked 134 .

but the inclusion of military-ruled myanmar has riled the europeans and has cast a shadow over the summit . on the day before friday 's official start of the gathering , the asia-europe forum inducted 13 more members into its informal ranks : 10 from europe , three from asia , including myanmar , formerly burma .
the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar . " we should continue the dialogue about human rights in our countries and the universal standards which should be kept .
i expect further improvements from myanmar as a new asem member . " new sanctions as eu leaders gathered in vietnam 's capital hanoi ahead of the meeting , they said that , despite myanmar 's inclusion in the group , the eu would tighten its sanctions against the country after it failed to meet demands by the eu to release suu kyi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi addresses a crowd in december 2002 her party , the national league of democracy , won elections in 1990 by a landslide but they were ignored by the country 's military rulers . " these conditions have not been met .
as a result , the eu will , at a meeting on oct .
11 , impose stricter sanctions on the regime in myanmar , " dutch foreign minister ben bot , who is attending the meeting , said in a statement .
the netherlands currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the sanctions include a visa ban , a prohibition on eu-registered firms from financing state-owned companies in myanmar and voting against international organizations extending loans to the country . " we will be taking the opportunity of the summit to underline - not least to the regime itself - our concerns about the unacceptable situation in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- and its continued lack of progress towards democracy , " british deputy prime minister john prescott said in a statement . strengthening contacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president romano prodi , center , and dutch foreign minister bernard bot , at right , address the media in hanoi .
the summit , asem 's fifth biennial gathering , consists of two days of talks on various issues , such as trade , north korea 's nuclear ambitions , iraq , united nations reform , disease control and cultural diversity . since thursday 's enlargement , the bloc has 39 member countries : 25 from europe , 13 from asia and the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the members represent about 60 percent of world trade and around three billion people .
both asia and europe see the group as a way to promote trade and security . in the wake of the iraq war , france in particular is hoping to position asem as a way of promoting a more " multipolar " agenda regarding world affairs and less dependence on the united states .
asem is one of the few large international groups that does not include the us as a member . china is hoping to convince the eu to lift its arms embargo , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
it has the support of french president jacques chirac , who on friday said the 15-year-old arms embargo on china made no sense .
he indicated that the eu could lift the ban next year despite us objections . human rights concerns play large still , the issue of myanmar and other human rights concerns , such as a crackdown by the vietnamese government on a buddhist group , have threatened to overshadow other topics . as the leaders convened in hanoi , the european parliament called for the immediate and unconditional release of the leaders of the outlawed buddhist church who are being held in detention . in an editorial in thursday 's international herald tribune , suu kyi 's fellow nobel prize winner archbishop desmond tutu accused world leaders of ignoring myanmar 's plight . " there in hanoi , state terrorists from myanmar will sit and dine with you leaders , " he wrote . the eu had originally threatened to boycott the summit rather than sit with myanmar 's leaders , but a compromise was found when the country agreed to send a lower-level delegation . while european leaders have used stern talk with myanmar , its asian neighbors have been more sympathetic of military rulers ' claims that they can not rush democratization nor will they allow outside forces to interfere in what they see as an internal affair . and despite the sometimes forceful language by the europeans in public , reuters obtained a draft final summit statement that suggests the overall group will not mention suu kyi 's name directly at the end of the meeting on saturday . " the leaders welcomed the assurance by myanmar that restrictions placed on specific political parties are provisional , and looked forward to the withdrawal of these restrictions at the earliest time , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .

" the leaders welcomed the assurance by myanmar that restrictions placed on specific political parties are provisional , and looked forward to the withdrawal of these restrictions at the earliest time , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .
" estonia is the only country in europe that has had such a vast naturalization process , " paul-eerik rummo , minister of population affairs , said .
" the best way to reply to criticism is to look at the facts .
the share of people living in estonia without any citizenship has decreased in the last 13 years , from 32 percent to 11 percent , " he said . afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 the reluctance to read großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these reading children are more the exception than the rule in germany the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .
but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .
" aldous huxley put it wonderfully : every person who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves , to multiply the ways in which they exist , to make life full , significant and interesting , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany germany can no longer take the education of its future generations for granted .

"
the crowds were so large that security officials rushed the germans out through a side entrance to their waiting bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bierhoff " that was wonderful ; it 's fantastic to get a welcome like that when you 're the visiting side , " german team manager oliver bierhoff told reporters .
" i 've never seen anything like this , " defender christian wörms said .
" this is just overwhelming . " the euphoria is not hard to understand .
though ireland played a world qualifier in tehran in 2001 and asian teams are regular visitors , saturday 's friendly marks the first time a major soccer power has visited the country since the iranian revolution in 1979 . " it 's the biggest event for the fans since over 30 years , " branko ivankovic , the croatian trainer of iran 's soccer team said .
" you can see how important the game is . " tehran in a tizzy excitement has been mounting in tehran over the past days with the city 's 14 daily newspapers filling their pages with coverage and background on saturday 's game .
tehran 's azadi stadium is expected to be filled to tight capacity with an estimated 10,000 fans . on thursday , the frenzy was palpable at a chaotic press conference attended by the two sides at the german team 's hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann amid a swamp of journalists , security personnel and cameras , german coach jürgen klinsmann , who created a stir when he spontaneously whisked off his players for a sightseeing tour of the shah 's palace instead of a training session , said " that 's how you get a feeling of where you are .
it was really great fun . " germans mean business but the 40-year-old klinsmann , who has ruffled a few feathers in german soccer circles with his unconventional ideas , made it clear that his team meant business . " we 've come here to win .
for us it 's a further important test for 2006 and we want to win it , " klinsmann said .
" and the team that 's here is confident of that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philipp lahm in action during the germany-austria game klinsmann has already included several youngsters in the team that will play saturday .
among them are aston villa 's 22-year-old midfielder thomas hitzlsperger , chelsea 's robert huth , 20 , vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm -lrb- photo -rrb- , 20 , and 22-year-old andreas hinkel .
" they will get a taste of what awaits them and will see whether they can come through it , " klinsmann said . germany , who have won the world cup three times , will host the world cup in 2006 and thus automatically qualify .
in past weeks , a 3-1 win over austria followed by a creditable 1-1 draw against brazil have boosted the team 's morale . " we have made strides forward in the matches against austria and brazil and want to take another step in the right direction , " klinsmann said . sports mingles with politics but for iran , saturday 's game is a slightly different story . coach ivankovic has said the game " comes at an unfortunate time . "
iran plays a decisive world cup qualification match against qatar on wednesday : a victory would take it a round further to qualifying for its third world cup .
in terms of its significance , the friendly with germany pales in comparision . " the players have to concentrate on wednesday 's game against qatar , " ivankovic said . despite the mass enthusiasm for the sport , soccer in iran is also linked to politics and the wills of the clergy .
since passion for soccer runs high in the country and has the capacity to mobilize thousands on the street , iran 's religious leaders tend to view it as a danger to the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vahid hashemian fights for the ball the country 's leadership has also exerted pressure on its players living abroad to toe their line .
striker vahid hashemian passed up a tour with bayern munich to tel aviv because iran forbids contacts with israel .
the official explanation by hashemian was that he had injured his back . hashemian has since returned to the iranian national soccer team and will play against germany on saturday .
" the people in iran should n't have the impression that i do n't want to play for our country , " he said at the press conference . hashemian has also pointed to iran 's soccer potential .
" iran has 70 million inhabitants , 13 million alone live in tehran .
soccer is played on every street , " hashemian said .
" we have the potential to be the best team in asia . " female iranian fans banned some are hoping saturday 's match might even have positive ramifications beyond sport borders . german team manager oliver bierhoff said he hoped the game would promote international relations between iran and germany , which have soured because of iran 's refusal to comply with the un nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , on its uranium-enrichment related activities . " we can show sport is a way to connect people , especially with regard to problematic issues in islamic countries , " bierhoff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young iranian women play soccer in a park in tehran but , iranian authorities don ’ t seem to share the view .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

the attack came a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . the rocket exploded early friday in the parking lot of a building next to the german embassy where journalists can get accredited for the polls , according to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . no one was injured in the attack , which came ahead of saturday 's presidential elections that militants of the former fundamentalist islamic taliban regime have vowed to disrupt . several embassies , including that of the united states as well as isaf headquarters and the united nations building are in the area where the blast occurred . supporting democratization process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder inspects german peacekeepers during his vist to the isaf base in kabul in may , 2002 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is to scheduled to visit afghanistan after attending the asem conference in the vietnamese capital of hanoi on friday , will go ahead with his plans . " chancellor schröder made it clear that he will stick to his plans , " the chancellor 's spokesman , bela anda told journalists .
" we are assessing the security situation very carefully , " anda added .
" we do n't know many details about the background of the attack but it was obviously aimed at disrupting the election process . " schröder is slated to visit isaf headquarters in kabul as well as hold talks with afghan president hamid karzai and german peacekeepers and civilian reconstruction workers . anda pointed out that more than 2,000 german isaf soldiers as well as civilian helpers are currently stationed in afghanistan and uzbekistan .
that 's why schröder " is determined to travel there , " he said and added that schröder wanted to support the democratization process in afghanistan with his visit a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . germans stay on another year security has been a huge concern in the run-up to the afghan elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , right , patrols together with an afghan policeman as children wave to them in kabul , afghanistan , in jan .

near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks in the country since august last year . nato general secretary de hoop scheffer has not ruled out attacks taking place during saturday 's elections .
" naturally , nato is not in a position to stop every saboteur who wants to create chaos .
that would be going too far , " de hoop scheffer said in berlin .
germany is one of the largest contributors to the multinational isaf force in afghanistan . the german parliament , which last week , extended the troops ' mandate by another year , also agreed that german soldiers would be deployed outside the capital of kabul to secure the elections .
german reinforcements have been sent to faizabad and kunduz in northern afghanistan since mid september , where german troops have already formed two so-called provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prts -rrb- . providing security and information the so-called " election reinforcements , " who are lightly armed with pistols and rifles , are meant to carry out patrols in the area and give the local population a sense of security as elections loom . on election day , the german soldiers are to support the afghan authorities by protecting polling stations , which are to be set up in schools and civic offices .
the soldiers will also help to monitor the transport of the ballots as well as aid in counting votes .
however , in the case of conflict , german troops will only intervene if the afghan army or police explicity ask for help . in addition to bolstering security , germany 's bundeswehr has also been informing the local population about the election via radio and a newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan man stands amongst several tv satellite dishes in downtown kabul , afghanistan .
the radio channel " voice of freedom " which broadcasts seven hours daily is made up of seven afghan journalists under german leadership .
the germans have also set up a newspaper under the same name , which is produced in kabul and includes eight pages on northern afghanistan . the aim of both the radio and newspaper programs is to provide general knowledge and inform the populace of the function and role of elections and thus aid the democratization process . the bundeswehr also has a tank and two trucks outfitted with loudspeakers in the region towards that purpose . according to a bundeswehr spokesman , the voter registration drive in kunduz has met with resounding success .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .
“ we continue to see traces of his activity .
he tries to organize , to motivate ” his followers , hanning said further .
but he didn ’ t elaborate . german intelligence officials continue to believe that bin laden is living in the afghan-pakistani border area , hanning said . the us-led invasion of iraq and repeated terror attacks are becoming a spiral of violence is pushing the country toward “ a crossroads . ”
this could end in total chaos , hanning said . ' terrorist breeding ground ' “ if we have a space there with no government authority , i fear that iraq would become a breeding ground for terrorism , ” hanning told reporters . it is “ by no means sure ” that iraq will achieve the transition toward stable democracy , the goal for the region set by us president george w. bush . during the conference , german interior minister otto schily sent a strong message to washington when he said “ whoever responds to violence only with violence ” was doomed to fail , the associated press reported . but despite germany ’ s running opposition to the us led action in iraq , hanning told the conference that at this point , all the countries now have a stake in iraq ’ s future . “ all of us have a common interest , whether we take part in the us-led coalition in iraq or not , ” hanning said .
“ this country must be stabilized . ” worry over weapons experts hanning stressed his concern about the pool of iraqi scientists who worked on saddam 's weapons programs , especially since there is evidence that al qaeda was working to obtain biological and chemical weapons . there is currently no evidence that islamic extremists have tried to link up with saddam 's former scientists .
still , “ we are concerned , ” he said .
the scientists “ are still around , in iraq , jordan or in other neighboring countries , ” he said . “ what happens with these weapons experts ' knowledge ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 literature nobel prize goes to austria 's jelinek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elfriede jelinek 's works often contain harsh social criticism for only the ninth time in the 103-year history of the nobel prize , the award for literature has gone to a woman .
elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

"
the crowds were so large that security officials rushed the germans out through a side entrance to their waiting bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bierhoff " that was wonderful ; it 's fantastic to get a welcome like that when you 're the visiting side , " german team manager oliver bierhoff told reporters .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .

but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .

and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .

certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .
" aldous huxley put it wonderfully : every person who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves , to multiply the ways in which they exist , to make life full , significant and interesting , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany germany can no longer take the education of its future generations for granted .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .

" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .

no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 the reluctance to read großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these reading children are more the exception than the rule in germany the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .
but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .
" aldous huxley put it wonderfully : every person who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves , to multiply the ways in which they exist , to make life full , significant and interesting , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany germany can no longer take the education of its future generations for granted .

" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .

the attack came a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . the rocket exploded early friday in the parking lot of a building next to the german embassy where journalists can get accredited for the polls , according to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . no one was injured in the attack , which came ahead of saturday 's presidential elections that militants of the former fundamentalist islamic taliban regime have vowed to disrupt . several embassies , including that of the united states as well as isaf headquarters and the united nations building are in the area where the blast occurred . supporting democratization process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder inspects german peacekeepers during his vist to the isaf base in kabul in may , 2002 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is to scheduled to visit afghanistan after attending the asem conference in the vietnamese capital of hanoi on friday , will go ahead with his plans . " chancellor schröder made it clear that he will stick to his plans , " the chancellor 's spokesman , bela anda told journalists .
" we are assessing the security situation very carefully , " anda added .
" we do n't know many details about the background of the attack but it was obviously aimed at disrupting the election process . " schröder is slated to visit isaf headquarters in kabul as well as hold talks with afghan president hamid karzai and german peacekeepers and civilian reconstruction workers . anda pointed out that more than 2,000 german isaf soldiers as well as civilian helpers are currently stationed in afghanistan and uzbekistan .
that 's why schröder " is determined to travel there , " he said and added that schröder wanted to support the democratization process in afghanistan with his visit a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . germans stay on another year security has been a huge concern in the run-up to the afghan elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , right , patrols together with an afghan policeman as children wave to them in kabul , afghanistan , in jan .

near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks in the country since august last year . nato general secretary de hoop scheffer has not ruled out attacks taking place during saturday 's elections .
" naturally , nato is not in a position to stop every saboteur who wants to create chaos .
that would be going too far , " de hoop scheffer said in berlin .
germany is one of the largest contributors to the multinational isaf force in afghanistan . the german parliament , which last week , extended the troops ' mandate by another year , also agreed that german soldiers would be deployed outside the capital of kabul to secure the elections .
german reinforcements have been sent to faizabad and kunduz in northern afghanistan since mid september , where german troops have already formed two so-called provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prts -rrb- . providing security and information the so-called " election reinforcements , " who are lightly armed with pistols and rifles , are meant to carry out patrols in the area and give the local population a sense of security as elections loom . on election day , the german soldiers are to support the afghan authorities by protecting polling stations , which are to be set up in schools and civic offices .
the soldiers will also help to monitor the transport of the ballots as well as aid in counting votes .
however , in the case of conflict , german troops will only intervene if the afghan army or police explicity ask for help . in addition to bolstering security , germany 's bundeswehr has also been informing the local population about the election via radio and a newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan man stands amongst several tv satellite dishes in downtown kabul , afghanistan .
the radio channel " voice of freedom " which broadcasts seven hours daily is made up of seven afghan journalists under german leadership .
the germans have also set up a newspaper under the same name , which is produced in kabul and includes eight pages on northern afghanistan . the aim of both the radio and newspaper programs is to provide general knowledge and inform the populace of the function and role of elections and thus aid the democratization process . the bundeswehr also has a tank and two trucks outfitted with loudspeakers in the region towards that purpose . according to a bundeswehr spokesman , the voter registration drive in kunduz has met with resounding success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 the reluctance to read großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these reading children are more the exception than the rule in germany the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .
but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german families prefer to watch television than read in a family 's normal daily routine , books would generally appear before bed time .
" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .
" aldous huxley put it wonderfully : every person who knows how to read has it in their power to magnify themselves , to multiply the ways in which they exist , to make life full , significant and interesting , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany germany can no longer take the education of its future generations for granted .

but who has their eyes on books ?
certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .
according to education minister edelgard bulmahn , the education system has to ensure in its curricula and pedagogical practice that reading competence is adequately encouraged .
it is n't just up to the schools , though .
many parents also need to do their part , said author budde .

" in most households , though , the most comfortable place at this time is in front of the television and that 's where the family sits , " she said .
and they usually are n't reading .
parents do n't have time to read bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nadia budde won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 " the fact that children do n't like to read as much anymore is certainly due to the fact that parents , who do n't have time , do n't read themselves or did n't read when they were young , are not introducing books to their children , " said budde -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .
in the last six years , the family ministry has spent 6.3 million euro -lrb- $ 7.7 million -rrb- to promote reading and literature .
making life fuller germany , a country known for its poets and philosophers , could face a difficult future if nothing is done to counteract children 's difficulties in reading .
" in many cases , this is linked to problems in school and significant disadvantages later during vocational training , " said schröder-köpf .
schmidt said kids had to be shown that reading was not something frustrating , but something that makes you want more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.10.2004 literature nobel prize goes to austria 's jelinek großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elfriede jelinek 's works often contain harsh social criticism for only the ninth time in the 103-year history of the nobel prize , the award for literature has gone to a woman .
elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.10.2004 estonia works to integrate russians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia joined the eu last may , one of ten new entries encouraged by the state , ever more ethnic russians in estonia are trying to shed their outsider status and gain citizenship - but not without debate . nearly a third of estonia 's 1.4 million inhabitants are ethnic russian , the result of post-war “ russification ” policy in the soviet union .
but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .
“ we continue to see traces of his activity .

this could end in total chaos , hanning said . ' terrorist breeding ground ' “ if we have a space there with no government authority , i fear that iraq would become a breeding ground for terrorism , ” hanning told reporters . it is “ by no means sure ” that iraq will achieve the transition toward stable democracy , the goal for the region set by us president george w. bush . during the conference , german interior minister otto schily sent a strong message to washington when he said “ whoever responds to violence only with violence ” was doomed to fail , the associated press reported . but despite germany ’ s running opposition to the us led action in iraq , hanning told the conference that at this point , all the countries now have a stake in iraq ’ s future . “ all of us have a common interest , whether we take part in the us-led coalition in iraq or not , ” hanning said .
“ this country must be stabilized . ” worry over weapons experts hanning stressed his concern about the pool of iraqi scientists who worked on saddam 's weapons programs , especially since there is evidence that al qaeda was working to obtain biological and chemical weapons . there is currently no evidence that islamic extremists have tried to link up with saddam 's former scientists .
still , “ we are concerned , ” he said .
the scientists “ are still around , in iraq , jordan or in other neighboring countries , ” he said . “ what happens with these weapons experts ' knowledge ?

the attack came a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . the rocket exploded early friday in the parking lot of a building next to the german embassy where journalists can get accredited for the polls , according to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . no one was injured in the attack , which came ahead of saturday 's presidential elections that militants of the former fundamentalist islamic taliban regime have vowed to disrupt . several embassies , including that of the united states as well as isaf headquarters and the united nations building are in the area where the blast occurred . supporting democratization process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder inspects german peacekeepers during his vist to the isaf base in kabul in may , 2002 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is to scheduled to visit afghanistan after attending the asem conference in the vietnamese capital of hanoi on friday , will go ahead with his plans . " chancellor schröder made it clear that he will stick to his plans , " the chancellor 's spokesman , bela anda told journalists .
" we are assessing the security situation very carefully , " anda added .
" we do n't know many details about the background of the attack but it was obviously aimed at disrupting the election process . " schröder is slated to visit isaf headquarters in kabul as well as hold talks with afghan president hamid karzai and german peacekeepers and civilian reconstruction workers . anda pointed out that more than 2,000 german isaf soldiers as well as civilian helpers are currently stationed in afghanistan and uzbekistan .
that 's why schröder " is determined to travel there , " he said and added that schröder wanted to support the democratization process in afghanistan with his visit a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . germans stay on another year security has been a huge concern in the run-up to the afghan elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , right , patrols together with an afghan policeman as children wave to them in kabul , afghanistan , in jan .
2002 .
near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks in the country since august last year . nato general secretary de hoop scheffer has not ruled out attacks taking place during saturday 's elections .
" naturally , nato is not in a position to stop every saboteur who wants to create chaos .
that would be going too far , " de hoop scheffer said in berlin .
germany is one of the largest contributors to the multinational isaf force in afghanistan . the german parliament , which last week , extended the troops ' mandate by another year , also agreed that german soldiers would be deployed outside the capital of kabul to secure the elections .
german reinforcements have been sent to faizabad and kunduz in northern afghanistan since mid september , where german troops have already formed two so-called provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prts -rrb- . providing security and information the so-called " election reinforcements , " who are lightly armed with pistols and rifles , are meant to carry out patrols in the area and give the local population a sense of security as elections loom . on election day , the german soldiers are to support the afghan authorities by protecting polling stations , which are to be set up in schools and civic offices .
the soldiers will also help to monitor the transport of the ballots as well as aid in counting votes .
however , in the case of conflict , german troops will only intervene if the afghan army or police explicity ask for help . in addition to bolstering security , germany 's bundeswehr has also been informing the local population about the election via radio and a newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan man stands amongst several tv satellite dishes in downtown kabul , afghanistan .
the radio channel " voice of freedom " which broadcasts seven hours daily is made up of seven afghan journalists under german leadership .
the germans have also set up a newspaper under the same name , which is produced in kabul and includes eight pages on northern afghanistan . the aim of both the radio and newspaper programs is to provide general knowledge and inform the populace of the function and role of elections and thus aid the democratization process . the bundeswehr also has a tank and two trucks outfitted with loudspeakers in the region towards that purpose . according to a bundeswehr spokesman , the voter registration drive in kunduz has met with resounding success .

the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar .

but the inclusion of military-ruled myanmar has riled the europeans and has cast a shadow over the summit . on the day before friday 's official start of the gathering , the asia-europe forum inducted 13 more members into its informal ranks : 10 from europe , three from asia , including myanmar , formerly burma .
the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar . " we should continue the dialogue about human rights in our countries and the universal standards which should be kept .

the netherlands currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the sanctions include a visa ban , a prohibition on eu-registered firms from financing state-owned companies in myanmar and voting against international organizations extending loans to the country . " we will be taking the opportunity of the summit to underline - not least to the regime itself - our concerns about the unacceptable situation in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- and its continued lack of progress towards democracy , " british deputy prime minister john prescott said in a statement . strengthening contacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president romano prodi , center , and dutch foreign minister bernard bot , at right , address the media in hanoi .

watch out for the scientists at a berlin symposium on thursday , the head of germany ’ s bundesnachrichtendienst , or bnd , also warned that the the west has underestimated the threat posed by the pool of scientists who worked on saddam hussein ’ s weapons programs in iraq . while he doesn ’ t believe the attacks on us forces in iraq are being directly led by osama bin ladin , hanning told symposium attendees the agency assumes the al-qaeda leader is still alive , news agencies reported .
the bnd doesn ’ t know exactly where he is , but if he were dead the agency would have heard about it , because it is tapping the phones of family members , hanning explained . traces of bin laden “ all indications are that he is alive , ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief august hanning hanning told reporters in berlin .
“ we continue to see traces of his activity .
he tries to organize , to motivate ” his followers , hanning said further .
but he didn ’ t elaborate . german intelligence officials continue to believe that bin laden is living in the afghan-pakistani border area , hanning said . the us-led invasion of iraq and repeated terror attacks are becoming a spiral of violence is pushing the country toward “ a crossroads . ”
this could end in total chaos , hanning said . ' terrorist breeding ground ' “ if we have a space there with no government authority , i fear that iraq would become a breeding ground for terrorism , ” hanning told reporters . it is “ by no means sure ” that iraq will achieve the transition toward stable democracy , the goal for the region set by us president george w. bush . during the conference , german interior minister otto schily sent a strong message to washington when he said “ whoever responds to violence only with violence ” was doomed to fail , the associated press reported . but despite germany ’ s running opposition to the us led action in iraq , hanning told the conference that at this point , all the countries now have a stake in iraq ’ s future . “ all of us have a common interest , whether we take part in the us-led coalition in iraq or not , ” hanning said .
“ this country must be stabilized . ” worry over weapons experts hanning stressed his concern about the pool of iraqi scientists who worked on saddam 's weapons programs , especially since there is evidence that al qaeda was working to obtain biological and chemical weapons . there is currently no evidence that islamic extremists have tried to link up with saddam 's former scientists .
still , “ we are concerned , ” he said .
the scientists “ are still around , in iraq , jordan or in other neighboring countries , ” he said . “ what happens with these weapons experts ' knowledge ?
who will put this knowledge to use ?
international terrorism ?

" chancellor schröder made it clear that he will stick to his plans , " the chancellor 's spokesman , bela anda told journalists .
" we are assessing the security situation very carefully , " anda added .
" we do n't know many details about the background of the attack but it was obviously aimed at disrupting the election process . " schröder is slated to visit isaf headquarters in kabul as well as hold talks with afghan president hamid karzai and german peacekeepers and civilian reconstruction workers . anda pointed out that more than 2,000 german isaf soldiers as well as civilian helpers are currently stationed in afghanistan and uzbekistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.10.2004 estonia works to integrate russians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia joined the eu last may , one of ten new entries encouraged by the state , ever more ethnic russians in estonia are trying to shed their outsider status and gain citizenship - but not without debate . nearly a third of estonia 's 1.4 million inhabitants are ethnic russian , the result of post-war “ russification ” policy in the soviet union .
but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .
" estonia is the only country in europe that has had such a vast naturalization process , " paul-eerik rummo , minister of population affairs , said .
" the best way to reply to criticism is to look at the facts .

but when the baltic state regained its independence in 1991 , the russians lost their foothold in society . now more than a decade later , there is debate over state-sponsored citizenship efforts , aimed at helping them integrate . the 35-year old marina samsonova was born in estonia but started to learn estonian only seven years ago .
in december , she hopes to pass language and constitution exams and to join the more than 100,000 russians who have gained estonian citizenship in the last 13 years . her story is far from unique .
samsonova is one of 157,035 non-estonians who have been living without any citizenship since the baltic state regained its independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tallinn " i was born and grew up in a small town -lrb- in eastern estonia near the russian border -rrb- , sillamae , that during soviet times had a huge military factory and was mainly inhabited by russians .
at my school we had no lessons in estonian at all , " samsonova , who works in a tallinn bar , said . protest against reforms as in latvia , where ethnic-russian youth have been protesting against education reform , estonia plans to implement a huge revamp in russian schools to ensure 60 percent of lessons in russian secondary schools will be given in the local language .
the reforms will take effect in 2007 .
" those who attack estonia as well as latvia for the school reform are very hypocritical , " says lilia sokolinskaja , a russian journalist who has worked 44 years in estonia for the main local russian-language radio .
" the aim of the changes is to end the current dead circle , which means thousands of young russians entering the labor market can compete only for jobs at the lowest level because they are unable to enter estonian universities or to become otherwise part of the estonian community , due to the lack of knowledge of the language , " she adds .
effort from both sides samsonova has a boyfriend living in moscow , but she has chosen to stay in estonia , which became a member of the european union this year .
she also believes russians must make more effort to integrate .
" i support the educational reform in russian schools , too .
no-one has ever insulted me for being russian but i have always known that i ca n't compete with estonians on the labor market .
this is why i finally started to study the language and applied for citizenship , " she says .
both samsonova and sokolinskaja said that while thousands of russians have made more efforts in the last few years to learn estonian , estonians are still too slow to accept russians as a full part of their society .
" one of our aims is to change the attitude of ordinary estonians , " concedes mati luik , director of the integration foundation , which handles dozens of integration programs , financed by the state , nordic countries and eu .
human rights violation denied in addition to over 100,000 russians who have already become estonian citizens and 157,000 people - mainly russians - who live in estonia without any citizenship , estonia has 88,500 russians who have russian citizenship and live in estonia with a residence permit .
estonia denies accusations by moscow that it is violating the russian minority ’ s human rights , saying it has cut in half the time for the citizenship application process and subsidizes costs of studying estonian .
" the process to apply for citizenship has been made easier , ” said mari pedak , director of the citizenship and migration board .
innovative program among other means to promote integration is a highly popular program that aims to send russian children to live with an estonian family for several weeks and learn the language .

" uschi eid , germany 's federal commissioner for africa in the development ministry , said maathai " is a symbol and a model for the women in africa who advocate preserving nature , maintaining peace and upholding equality . " deputy general secretary of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , dorothea rüland , said she welcomed the fact that " such a committed and brave woman " had won the prize .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .

even so , anne frank has been dubbed " frankfurt 's most famous daughter , " an analogy to " frankfurt 's most famous son , " johann wolfgang von goethe . as far as the german government is concerned , however , anne frank is german .

a dutch tv program has put anne frank on its candidate list of greatest dutch people of all time , igniting a debate about the citizenship of the jewish girl who was persecuted by the nazis . the fact that " the diary of anne frank " was one of the most read books of the 20th century was reason enough for the dutch tv broadcaster katholieke radio omroep -lrb- kro -rrb- to put the girl on its list of candidates for its show on the greatest dutch people of all time .
before being deported to the bergen-belsen concentration camp where she died at age 15 , the german-born girl penned her famous diary from 1942 to 1944 from her family 's hideaway in an amsterdam apartment building .
the franks fled to holland from germany in 1933 .
now kro has started an initiative for anne frank to be awarded dutch citizenship . the dutch justice ministry has said it sympathizes with the proposal to posthumously naturalize anne frank - whose german citizenship was rescinded by the nazi regime in 1941 .
but dutch citizenship laws do n't allow naturalization after death , according to patricia bosboom , a spokeswoman for the anne frank house in amsterdam . as dutch as you can be bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank house , amsterdam " we still view her as dutch , " bosboom said .
" she wrote in dutch ; she thought in dutch .
she was as dutch as you can be . " those sentiments were echoed in frank 's home town of frankfurt am main .
" in her diary , anne frank expressed her longing to become dutch after the war , " susanne wiegmann , managing director of the anne frank youth meeting center there , told dw-world .
even so , anne frank has been dubbed " frankfurt 's most famous daughter , " an analogy to " frankfurt 's most famous son , " johann wolfgang von goethe . as far as the german government is concerned , however , anne frank is german .
" she was german up to her death , since the nazi regime 's denial of citizenship is null and void , " rainer lingenthal , an interior ministry spokesman told the german dpa news agency . rewriting history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne frank leans over the balcony of her apartment in amsterdam in may 1941 .
the photograph was taken by her father , otto frank .
" it 's a debate that we can only warn against , " thomas heppener , head of berlin 's anne frank center told dw-world .
" it leads us away from the ideals that anne frank described in her diary . "
heppener was equally critical of the proposal to naturalize frank : " it would amount to retrospectively smoothing out the difficulties of history . " but heppener welcomed the television show 's decision to allow people to vote anne frank a great dutch personality .
" that way you can reach simple people who otherwise would hardly be interested in her fate , " he said . the dutch will have the chance to decide for themselves on oct .
11 at 8:30 p.m. on kanal nederland 1 , when anne frank will compete against the likes of painter vincent van gogh and soccer player johan cruyff for the title of greatest dutch personality . on last year 's " our best - the 100 greatest germans , " anne frank only ranked 134 .

" i 've never seen anything like this , " defender christian wörms said .
" this is just overwhelming . " the euphoria is not hard to understand .
though ireland played a world qualifier in tehran in 2001 and asian teams are regular visitors , saturday 's friendly marks the first time a major soccer power has visited the country since the iranian revolution in 1979 . " it 's the biggest event for the fans since over 30 years , " branko ivankovic , the croatian trainer of iran 's soccer team said .
" you can see how important the game is . " tehran in a tizzy excitement has been mounting in tehran over the past days with the city 's 14 daily newspapers filling their pages with coverage and background on saturday 's game .

the attack came a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . the rocket exploded early friday in the parking lot of a building next to the german embassy where journalists can get accredited for the polls , according to the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan . no one was injured in the attack , which came ahead of saturday 's presidential elections that militants of the former fundamentalist islamic taliban regime have vowed to disrupt . several embassies , including that of the united states as well as isaf headquarters and the united nations building are in the area where the blast occurred . supporting democratization process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder inspects german peacekeepers during his vist to the isaf base in kabul in may , 2002 .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is to scheduled to visit afghanistan after attending the asem conference in the vietnamese capital of hanoi on friday , will go ahead with his plans . " chancellor schröder made it clear that he will stick to his plans , " the chancellor 's spokesman , bela anda told journalists .
" we are assessing the security situation very carefully , " anda added .
" we do n't know many details about the background of the attack but it was obviously aimed at disrupting the election process . " schröder is slated to visit isaf headquarters in kabul as well as hold talks with afghan president hamid karzai and german peacekeepers and civilian reconstruction workers . anda pointed out that more than 2,000 german isaf soldiers as well as civilian helpers are currently stationed in afghanistan and uzbekistan .
that 's why schröder " is determined to travel there , " he said and added that schröder wanted to support the democratization process in afghanistan with his visit a day before the country 's first free presidential elections . germans stay on another year security has been a huge concern in the run-up to the afghan elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier , right , patrols together with an afghan policeman as children wave to them in kabul , afghanistan , in jan .
2002 .
near-daily attacks , blamed on remnants of the taliban and entrenched warlords , have prompted many of the 18 candidates contesting the polls to call for the election to be postponed .
over 1,000 people have died in militant-related attacks in the country since august last year . nato general secretary de hoop scheffer has not ruled out attacks taking place during saturday 's elections .
" naturally , nato is not in a position to stop every saboteur who wants to create chaos .
that would be going too far , " de hoop scheffer said in berlin .
germany is one of the largest contributors to the multinational isaf force in afghanistan . the german parliament , which last week , extended the troops ' mandate by another year , also agreed that german soldiers would be deployed outside the capital of kabul to secure the elections .
german reinforcements have been sent to faizabad and kunduz in northern afghanistan since mid september , where german troops have already formed two so-called provincial reconstruction teams -lrb- prts -rrb- . providing security and information the so-called " election reinforcements , " who are lightly armed with pistols and rifles , are meant to carry out patrols in the area and give the local population a sense of security as elections loom . on election day , the german soldiers are to support the afghan authorities by protecting polling stations , which are to be set up in schools and civic offices .
the soldiers will also help to monitor the transport of the ballots as well as aid in counting votes .
however , in the case of conflict , german troops will only intervene if the afghan army or police explicity ask for help . in addition to bolstering security , germany 's bundeswehr has also been informing the local population about the election via radio and a newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan man stands amongst several tv satellite dishes in downtown kabul , afghanistan .

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power . "
jelinek , born in the steiermark region of austria in 1946 , made her literary debut in 1967 with the publication of a poetry collection called " lisas schatten " -lrb- " lisa 's shadow " -rrb- .
but she first gained wider attention with the 1970 release of a satirical novel , " we are decoys , baby , " which set the theme for much of her later work , in which she unemotionally - some would say coldly - illustrates the violence and power plays inherent in human relations , especially those between the sexes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film " the piano teacher " other well-known works include " the lover , " the semi-autobiographical " the piano teacher , " which was made into a 2002 movie starring actress isabelle huppert -lrb- photo -rrb- , and " lust , " all of which paint the world as a brutal dance between hunter and prey , where sexual violence , particularly against women , is one of the defining characteristics of global culture .
it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .
it was after she became involved in the student movement in the late 1960s that her tone changed and she began exploring social inequalities and sexual power politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : booksellers are now putting her books on prominent display her diverse background has led to a style that many find hard to categorize .
the swedish academy described it as often floating " between prose and poetry , incantation and hymn . "
her works contain theatrical scenes and film sequences and some of her later works for the stage have completely done away with the idea of living characters .
jelinek has opted instead for " talking surfaces " that interact with one another .
since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .
praise from german literary community alexander fest , head of the german publishing house rowohlt , which released jelinek 's work for many years , said he was thrilled with the nobel committee 's selection , describing jelinek as a writer " undreamt of indiosyncracy " who has consistently shown " great courage and great ruthlessness in the face of her subjects and herself . "
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "
according to him , jelinek will not go to stockholm to accept the award personally , because she is - perhaps unlike her subject matter - " a very nervous , very sensitive and delicate woman . "
her nobel prize will be accompanied by a check for more than 10 million swedish kroner -lrb- € 1.1 million , $ 1.3 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading shares in geniuses and heroes the work of the committee that selects nobel prize winners might be strictly confidential , but the university of frankfurt is betting that it can predict who the next winners will be using a virtual stock market .

it was the publication of her 1995 novel " die kinder der toten " -lrb- " the children of the dead " -rrb- , which set her on a par with other austrian literary greats such as karl kraus , ödön von horvath and thomas bernhard .
jelinek has said she considers it her defining work , in which she presents a razor-sharp critique of austrian society what she once called " a ghost story of austrian identity . "
while she has become one of austria 's most influential voices , but her subject matter and style , sometimes considered pornographic , has drawn good deal of criticism .
she is controversial to say the least .
diverse influences early in her adult life , jelinek pursued a career in music , studying composition at the vienna conservatory .
later she added theater studies and art history to her resume and began turning her attention to poetry and prose .

since her 1974 marriage , jelinek has divided her time between vienna and munich .

"
germany 's perhaps best-known literary critic , marcel reich-ranicki , said he was overjoyed that another female author writing in the german language had one the award .
he called jelinek an " extremely unusual , radical and extreme author , and as a result , a highly controversial one . "

elfriede jelinek was commended for her frequent critiques of consumerism and the subjugation of women . the royal swedish academy announced thursday that the 57-year-old novelist , poet , dramatist and essayist elfriede jelinek has won literature 's top honor , saying the " musical flow of voices and counter-voices " in her work " reveal the absurdity of society 's clichés and their subjugating power .

but the inclusion of military-ruled myanmar has riled the europeans and has cast a shadow over the summit . on the day before friday 's official start of the gathering , the asia-europe forum inducted 13 more members into its informal ranks : 10 from europe , three from asia , including myanmar , formerly burma .
the inclusion of that country , which has been condemned for its lack of democracy and detention of human rights activist and 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , caused deep disquiet among eu leaders . on friday , leaders of the asem called on myanmar to improve its human rights record and take steps toward democratic reforms , but it appeared to stop short of demanding the release of suu kyi , who is being held under house arrest . german chancellor gerhard schröder told delegates in a closed door session that human rights must be improved in myanmar . " we should continue the dialogue about human rights in our countries and the universal standards which should be kept .
i expect further improvements from myanmar as a new asem member . " new sanctions as eu leaders gathered in vietnam 's capital hanoi ahead of the meeting , they said that , despite myanmar 's inclusion in the group , the eu would tighten its sanctions against the country after it failed to meet demands by the eu to release suu kyi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi addresses a crowd in december 2002 her party , the national league of democracy , won elections in 1990 by a landslide but they were ignored by the country 's military rulers . " these conditions have not been met .
as a result , the eu will , at a meeting on oct .
11 , impose stricter sanctions on the regime in myanmar , " dutch foreign minister ben bot , who is attending the meeting , said in a statement .
the netherlands currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . the sanctions include a visa ban , a prohibition on eu-registered firms from financing state-owned companies in myanmar and voting against international organizations extending loans to the country . " we will be taking the opportunity of the summit to underline - not least to the regime itself - our concerns about the unacceptable situation in burma -lrb- myanmar -rrb- and its continued lack of progress towards democracy , " british deputy prime minister john prescott said in a statement . strengthening contacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president romano prodi , center , and dutch foreign minister bernard bot , at right , address the media in hanoi .
the summit , asem 's fifth biennial gathering , consists of two days of talks on various issues , such as trade , north korea 's nuclear ambitions , iraq , united nations reform , disease control and cultural diversity . since thursday 's enlargement , the bloc has 39 member countries : 25 from europe , 13 from asia and the european commission , the eu 's executive arm .
the members represent about 60 percent of world trade and around three billion people .
both asia and europe see the group as a way to promote trade and security . in the wake of the iraq war , france in particular is hoping to position asem as a way of promoting a more " multipolar " agenda regarding world affairs and less dependence on the united states .
asem is one of the few large international groups that does not include the us as a member . china is hoping to convince the eu to lift its arms embargo , in place since the 1989 tiananmen square massacre .
it has the support of french president jacques chirac , who on friday said the 15-year-old arms embargo on china made no sense .
he indicated that the eu could lift the ban next year despite us objections . human rights concerns play large still , the issue of myanmar and other human rights concerns , such as a crackdown by the vietnamese government on a buddhist group , have threatened to overshadow other topics . as the leaders convened in hanoi , the european parliament called for the immediate and unconditional release of the leaders of the outlawed buddhist church who are being held in detention . in an editorial in thursday 's international herald tribune , suu kyi 's fellow nobel prize winner archbishop desmond tutu accused world leaders of ignoring myanmar 's plight . " there in hanoi , state terrorists from myanmar will sit and dine with you leaders , " he wrote . the eu had originally threatened to boycott the summit rather than sit with myanmar 's leaders , but a compromise was found when the country agreed to send a lower-level delegation . while european leaders have used stern talk with myanmar , its asian neighbors have been more sympathetic of military rulers ' claims that they can not rush democratization nor will they allow outside forces to interfere in what they see as an internal affair . and despite the sometimes forceful language by the europeans in public , reuters obtained a draft final summit statement that suggests the overall group will not mention suu kyi 's name directly at the end of the meeting on saturday . " the leaders welcomed the assurance by myanmar that restrictions placed on specific political parties are provisional , and looked forward to the withdrawal of these restrictions at the earliest time , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese premier presses eu to lift arms embargo on the second stage of his european tour , wen jiabao is expected to continue his campaign to end the 15-year eu weapons ban .

certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .
nadia budde , a children 's book author who won germany 's youth literature prize in 2000 , agreed .
" reading does not have any significance anymore , " budde told dw-world .
" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "
a joint effort the pisa results certainly shook the german government up .
it is now making efforts to reform the country 's schools .

the local community can also do its part , though , said federal family minister renate schmidt .
" if schools , libraries and other extracurricular educational institutions cooperated closely , we could awaken the delight for reading in children and adolescents , " she said .

certainly not german children and adolescents - they simply do n't like to read . three years ago , the organization for economic cooperation and development 's -lrb- oecd -rrb- pisa study found that german students scored below average in reading when compared to their peers in other oecd countries .
according to the findings , almost half of 15-year-olds said they never read for their own pleasure .
yet reading is a crucial part of a child 's development , said doris schröder-köpf , the wife of german chancellor gerhard schröder and patron of the reading initiative deutschland liest vor or " germany reads . "
" many children do n't experience reading as something enjoyable and not at all as an exciting journey into their own world , " said schröder-köpf .
for children , reading has simply become a duty performed at school .

" it is n't presented to children as something exciting , neither at school or at home . "

no-one knows definitively why the hull-registered gaul sank in one of the uk 's worst fishing tragedies but there has been no shortage of theories .
some say the soviet union torpedoed the vessel because it suspected it was being used for spying , others back a less sinister version of events in which heavy seas battered the gaul , causing it to founder .
and now the inquiry into the disaster is to hear evidence suggesting a british submarine became caught in its fishing nets and dragged the trawler underwater .
' crew imprisoned ' a public inquiry at the time concluded the 18-month-old ship had sunk , without raising a mayday signal , after being battered by heavy seas .
but rumours abounded with some famillies believing the ship had been captured by the soviet union and crew members imprisoned .
the tragedy has taken precedence over a lot of things in my life - had we known what had happened earlier , we could have grieved and got over it beryl betts , sister of factory hand billy jones the families , unconvinced by official findings , united as the gaul families ' association to call on the government to carry out another investigation .
but it was 1997 before there was a significant breakthrough .
an expedition funded by uk and norwegian television companies found the gaul on the seabed off the norwegian coast .
deputy prime minister john prescott subsequently launched an inquiry in 1999 after a survey of the wreck brought new evidence to light .
it appeared two hatches and a door had been open when the ship sank , according to the uk government survey .
an underwater camera reveals the wheelhouse of the sunken gaul but a year later the government was lambasted in an official report by a former department of transport shipping policy chief for failing to search for the wreck of the gaul before 1997 .
the report by roger clarke found there was " no calculation " within the ministry of defence and the department of transport , and said cost considerations and uncertainty about where to look were the main reasons why no search was made .
it also concluded that government records on the gaul were prematurely destroyed or overlooked .
remains identified a further breakthrough came in 2002 when the remains of four men were raised from the wreck and dna was matched to crew members james wales , maurice spurgeon , stanley collier and clifford briggs .
this brought comfort to some relatives but left others wondering where their loved ones were .
at the start of the latest inquiry in january , attorney general lord goldsmith threw out any claims of espionage .
both an intelligence officer and former first-mate testified there was no spying on the ship , only fishing .
lord goldsmith had earlier said the mod ran a scheme in hull in which naval commanders liaised with trawler skippers in the 1960s , and other trawlers had been involved in recovering lost missiles in the barents sea in 1972 and 1973 .
these activities though were over by 1974 , he said .
derek barron claims a submarine may have been responsible for the gaul sinking findings from this latest inquiry will not be available until later this year following a hearing on friday when derek barron , an ex-chief petty officer will give evidence to the wreck commissioner .
he claims to have overheard a conversation in a naval mess in 1983 suggesting a submarine may have come into contact with the gaul .
for the families of the 36 lost men , the investigations , inquiries , claims and counter-claims over the past 30 years , have , in most cases , taken over their lives .
' tragedy has taken over ' beryl betts 's brother billy jones was a 26-year-old factory hand on board the gaul when it went down .
she told bbc news online : " we had just lost my dad and billy wanted to take my younger brother and sister to spain to help them get over the trauma so he was trying to save up some money .
" it was my older brother who told me that billy was missing , " she said .
" the tragedy has taken precedence over a lot of things in my life that it should n't have done .
had we known what had happened earlier , we could have grieved and got over it , " she added .
mrs betts said she is like the majority of crewmen 's relatives who are not able to accept the offical findings that the trawler foundered in heavy seas and is convinced a submarine was involved in some way .
solicitor for 34 of the 36 crew members , barry tindall of max gold partnership , said most families hoped friday 's hearing would bring the events of the past 30 years to a conclusion .
maybe then the mystery will finally be laid to rest .

last month , manufacturers bausch and lomb issued a national recall after reports that some lenses became cloudy .
plymouth 's royal eye infirmary estimated that around 200 of the 5,000 patients given the lens over a three-year period might need further surgery .
plymouth hospitals trust set up a helpline for worried patients to ring .
cloudy vision the trust said 692 people had contacted the helpline and they were following up 294 of the calls which reported symptoms that could be associated with the hydroview lens , or where people sounded as though they needed reassurance .
the trust is uncertain whether these cases are linked with the faulty lens , so there are no figures available for the number of people who need treatment as a result .
the problem with the hydroview lens implant was made public in september .
it can potentially turn opaque over time , leading to cloudy vision .
the problem developed because of the way the lens was packaged , affecting a small batch .

charity shelter and the church of scotland have called on new communities minister malcolm chisholm to make the target his highest priority .
shelter said children can suffer profound effects from living in b & bs .
a scottish executive spokesman said it planned to bring in measures to tackle the issue by christmas .
mr chisholm took over the communities portfolio from margaret curran in the executive 's cabinet reshuffle earlier this week . "
no child in 21st century scotland should suffer the indignity of living in b & b accommodation " liz nicholson shelter scotland shelter scotland said more than a million children in the uk were suffering in bad housing and that the clock was ticking to meet the executive 's deadline , set by ms curran , to end the use of b & bs for homeless children by christmas 2004 .
it said regulations to ban the use of b & bs for families were still not in place and that children in b & bs were twice as likely to be admitted to a & e with burns and scalds because of the conditions they live in .
the charity 's director , liz nicholson , said : " no child in 21st century scotland should suffer the indignity of living in b & b accommodation .
" even in an emergency , seven days is the longest any child should be forced to live in these conditions - anything longer will be a loophole that effectively means b & bs are not banned at all .
" the minister can really make his mark by backing the pledge made by his predecessor . "
the charity claims that the number of children living in b & bs increased by 26 % between 31 march , 2003 and 13 march , 2004 , from 185 to 234 .
dr alison elliott , moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland , said : " a home is n't just for christmas but it 's at christmas that the plight of homeless children makes a special impact on our sense of decency .
" i hope that the minister will make good his predecessor 's pledge not to use b & bs to house children at christmas or any other time of the year . "
an executive spokesman said : " the scottish executive remains committed to ending the inappropriate use of unsuitable temporary accommodation for families .
" we have recently finished a public consultation on this issue , and plan to lay the necessary parliamentary orders in good time for them to be in force by christmas . "

charity shelter and the church of scotland have called on new communities minister malcolm chisholm to make the target his highest priority .
shelter said children can suffer profound effects from living in b & bs .
a scottish executive spokesman said it planned to bring in measures to tackle the issue by christmas .
mr chisholm took over the communities portfolio from margaret curran in the executive 's cabinet reshuffle earlier this week .
no child in 21st century scotland should suffer the indignity of living in b & b accommodation liz nicholson shelter scotland shelter scotland said more than a million children in the uk were suffering in bad housing and that the clock was ticking to meet the executive 's deadline , set by ms curran , to end the use of b & bs for homeless children by christmas 2004 .
it said regulations to ban the use of b & bs for families were still not in place and that children in b & bs were twice as likely to be admitted to a & e with burns and scalds because of the conditions they live in .
the charity 's director , liz nicholson , said : " no child in 21st century scotland should suffer the indignity of living in b & b accommodation .
" even in an emergency , seven days is the longest any child should be forced to live in these conditions - anything longer will be a loophole that effectively means b & bs are not banned at all .
shelter warned of adverse effects of b & bs on children " the minister can really make his mark by backing the pledge made by his predecessor . "
the charity claims that the number of children living in b & bs increased by 26 % between 31 march , 2003 and 13 march , 2004 , from 185 to 234 .
dr alison elliott , moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland , said : " a home is n't just for christmas but it 's at christmas that the plight of homeless children makes a special impact on our sense of decency .
" i hope that the minister will make good his predecessor 's pledge not to use b & bs to house children at christmas or any other time of the year . "
an executive spokesman said : " the scottish executive remains committed to ending the inappropriate use of unsuitable temporary accommodation for families .
" we have recently finished a public consultation on this issue , and plan to lay the necessary parliamentary orders in good time for them to be in force by christmas . "
orders are required to be laid in parliament for 21 days before they can be brought into force .
during the passage of the homelessness etc -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 2003 , shelter successfully lobbied for a clause to be inserted allowing the communities minister to prescribe which types of temporary accommodation would not be used to house homeless families with children .

like many other rural areas , very few nhs dentists are taking on new patients in the county and most private pratices are also full .
the new dentist will work across the county , but people will not be able to register with him or her .
the local health board said it was just one way it was trying to tackle the issue .
ian jones , a dental surgeon in milford haven , said he was " delighted " with the announcement .
the assembly and ourselves and the dental profession are trying hard to recruit dentists .
bernardine rees , pembrokeshire local health board " pembrokeshire has something like 2.9 dentists per 10,000 population - that compares with over four per 10,000 in cardiff , " he said .
" we are chronically short of dentists . "
he said the new role was a step in the right direction .
" it is perhaps a sticking plaster over a large defect , but it is certainly to be welcomed , " he said .
" it is nice to see we are achieving something , but we have to do a lot more to attract dentists in the long term to provide comprehensive services in west wales . "
the post has been made possible with the help of funding from the welsh assembly government .
bernardine rees , chief executive of pembrokeshire local health board , said it was taking the shortage of dental services very seriously .
" we will use our salaried dentist to actually deal with the emergency health needs of the unregistered population , but we wo n't be registering patients , " she said .
" the assembly and ourselves and the dental profession are trying hard to recruit dentists .
" it is a uk-wide problem , not only a welsh or a pembrokeshire problem . "
earlier this year , welsh assembly health minister jane hutt announced that pembrokeshire would be one of six counties sharing £ 510,000 to tackle the shortage .
it followed a £ 5.3m injection in may , and a rise in the number of dental training places in wales .
last july , hundreds of people from across mid and west wales were turned away after spending hours queuing to get on the books of an nhs dentist in carmarthen .

the main blast happened at the hilton hotel in taba on the sinai peninsula , a resort popular with israelis .
israeli officials say a vehicle loaded with explosives blew up after ramming the hotel , killing 19 people .
the other blasts hit backpacker beaches near the resort of nuweiba 60km -lrb- 38 miles -rrb- further south , killing two .
officials had initially reported at least 30 dead , but by friday morning they said rescuers had located 19 bodies in the rubble .
an israeli general says 122 people were wounded in the attack .
ten floors of taba 's hilton hotel have collapsed , and it is feared some people may be trapped .
at least two were killed in the other two blasts .
israel 's deputy defence minister zeev boim , who is in taba , said it was too early to say who carried out the attacks , but an attack like this could not have been anticipated .
i was in the casino when it happened .
there was a massive explosion and the left wall came down yigal vakni witness britons among blast injured but he told reporters : " in my personal opinion it seems that it is more fitted to the international terror groups like al-qaeda or some branches of al-qaeda . "
taba is the main crossing point between israel and egypt , and a major gateway for thousands of israelis going on holiday to resorts and hotels on the red sea .
many holidaymakers would have been celebrating the last day of a jewish holiday , sukkot .
the israeli government has now told them to get out of egypt .
the bbc 's james reynolds , who is at the border , says he saw hundreds of israeli tourists walking across the border quietly and sadly , many with tears in their eyes .
israeli rescue teams with bulldozers have headed across the border towards the hotel to look through the wreckage .
barren peninsula the hilton hotel is cut off from the outside world by the israeli border to the north and an egyptian checkpoint immediately to the south .
the egyptian authorities have long regarded the eastern sinai coast , along the gulf of aqaba , as less likely terrorist targets than the great monuments along the nile .
it is a long way across the barren peninsula and security is fairly easily enforced .
at the end of 2000 , it hosted the last serious round of peace talks between israel and the palestinians .
the hotel also attracts israeli gamblers to its casino .
the other explosions were in ras al-shitan , a camping area that is popular with young israeli backpackers .
the site is near the town of nuweiba , which itself boasts a few hotels and restaurants .
the israeli authorities said they were sending buses to evacuate any of the 12,000 to 15,000 israelis in the sinai who wish to leave .
' people started to run ' last month , the israeli government urged its citizens not to visit egypt , saying there had been a firm threat to tourists there .
israeli emergency teams are taking part in the rescue , and casualties are being treated in taba and the nearby israeli resort of eilat .
" there are dozens of people on the floor , lots of blood , it is very tense , " one witness to the hilton blast , yigal vakni , told israeli radio .
" i was in the casino when it happened .
there was a massive explosion and the left wall came down .

some hard facts , certainly : that tony blair had a heart flutter and a minor op ; and that he intends to try to stay in power for another four or five years , despite or because of gordon brown 's frustration .
that michael howard believes that , had it not been for churchill , he 'd have died as a small boy in a nazi concentration camp .
howard put trust in politics centre stage that the liberal democrats think they can take another 30 seats in a general election , knocking out a row of senior tories .
oh yes , and that the minnow newcomer , the uk independence party , has nevertheless grown big enough to have its very own leadership kerfuffle , courtesy of the charisma-larded tv star and former labour mp , robert kilroy-silk .
we 've learned a bit more about the main parties ' electoral strategies , too .
they are all struggling , one way or another , with the perceived problem of trust , or rather general electoral mistrust of the political classes .
how to get the voters to take notice once more ?
the lib dems and tories are piling into tony blair , his iraq war , and his platoon of spin-doctors as the source of most of the trouble .
' west side story ' the conservatives have also taken new labour 's old pledge card idea , and stretched it across a calendar , making it a diary of promises , day by day , and week by week .
john prescott made much of hunt protesters ' contorted faces labour , meanwhile - and we can call it " labour " again , tony blair having largely dropped the " new " in his conference speech - is responding with a detailed manifesto of mainstream , domestic pledges and a doughty defence of its economic competence .
labour does not feel , or act , like a party which expects to be turned out of office next year .
' antagonism ' it oozes a bland corporate confidence .
behind that , of course , it is experiencing a renewed and vicious bout of internal faction-fighting .
its brighton conference reminded journalists forcibly of " west side story " .
tony blair and gordon brown share a moment in the conference hall brownites and blairites swaggered around in mutually suspicious gangs , eyeing each other and whispering , as if the jets and the sharks had found themselves suddenly transported to the breakfast tables of the metropole and grand hotels .
will this really harm them ?
there is no genuine ideological gap between the rival camps .
' premonition of a row ' it 's mostly personal .
yet the level of antagonism was genuinely shocking ; whatever happens next , things can not carry on like this .
mr kennedy prepares for his key-note speech the liberal democrats are not , for the time being , suffering from any comparable leadership frenzies .
charles kennedy infuriated some of his younger , leaner colleagues earlier in the year by what seemed a ludicrously laid-back attitude to the job .
but so far , it seems to be working , and he has raised his game , giving a strong speech .
there is a potential political divide in the party , between the market-orientated , anti-statist lib dems clustered around a volume of essays called the orange book , and those you might call conventional social democrats .
' hand signals ' but that 's a premonition of a row , a squall and a smudge on the horizon , not yet the real thing .
similarly , if you looked closely during the tory conference , you could see people lining up to argue with one another after the election .
boris johnson sits through yet another conference speech the biggest group around michael howard are moderates , who think the conservatives have to hold their nerve on centre-right policies , not lurching towards the uk independence party , or making wild promises on tax .
they are currently in the ascendant .
but there are potential leadership candidates on the right making personal hand-signals to the tory activists , who are now crucial to any succession , on issues like europe , tax and immigration .
' coup de theatre ' it is n't a fight - not now , not as we enter the winter whose spring might bring the election .
but if the tories lose , it will be a fight .
demonstrators strip to make their point about the pensions crisis my final thought about this conference season , however , is that it felt overshadowed .
there was the grim challenge of the iraq hostage crisis and ken bigley 's fate - felt particularly strongly during the liberal democrat and labour weeks .
there was the hartlepool by-election , in which the tories came fourth .
there was the confrontation between john kerry and george bush , and the report of the iraq survey group , which will have a far bigger impact on international affairs than anything said in a british party conference .
tony blair sings with the corus steel workers choir and there was the prime minister 's cool coup de theatre on the subject of his own future .
he waited until everyone had just left brighton .
power is n't with the party workers .
it 's a melancholy thought to end on , but we journalists have spent three weeks in conference centres , while hardly feeling central at all .

some hard facts , certainly : that tony blair had a heart flutter and a minor op ; and that he intends to try to stay in power for another four or five years , despite or because of gordon brown 's frustration .
that michael howard believes that , had it not been for churchill , he 'd have died as a small boy in a nazi concentration camp .
howard put trust in politics centre stage that the liberal democrats think they can take another 30 seats in a general election , knocking out a row of senior tories .
oh yes , and that the minnow newcomer , the uk independence party , has nevertheless grown big enough to have its very own leadership kerfuffle , courtesy of the charisma-larded tv star and former labour mp , robert kilroy-silk .
we 've learned a bit more about the main parties ' electoral strategies , too .
they are all struggling , one way or another , with the perceived problem of trust , or rather general electoral mistrust of the political classes .
how to get the voters to take notice once more ?
the lib dems and tories are piling into tony blair , his iraq war , and his platoon of spin-doctors as the source of most of the trouble .
' west side story ' the conservatives have also taken new labour 's old pledge card idea , and stretched it across a calendar , making it a diary of promises , day by day , and week by week .
john prescott made much of hunt protesters ' contorted faces labour , meanwhile - and we can call it " labour " again , tony blair having largely dropped the " new " in his conference speech - is responding with a detailed manifesto of mainstream , domestic pledges and a doughty defence of its economic competence .
labour does not feel , or act , like a party which expects to be turned out of office next year .
' antagonism ' it oozes a bland corporate confidence .
behind that , of course , it is experiencing a renewed and vicious bout of internal faction-fighting .
its brighton conference reminded journalists forcibly of " west side story " .
tony blair and gordon brown share a moment in the conference hall brownites and blairites swaggered around in mutually suspicious gangs , eyeing each other and whispering , as if the jets and the sharks had found themselves suddenly transported to the breakfast tables of the metropole and grand hotels .
will this really harm them ?
there is no genuine ideological gap between the rival camps .
' premonition of a row ' it 's mostly personal .
yet the level of antagonism was genuinely shocking ; whatever happens next , things can not carry on like this .
mr kennedy prepares for his key-note speech the liberal democrats are not , for the time being , suffering from any comparable leadership frenzies .
charles kennedy infuriated some of his younger , leaner colleagues earlier in the year by what seemed a ludicrously laid-back attitude to the job .
but so far , it seems to be working , and he has raised his game , giving a strong speech .
there is a potential political divide in the party , between the market-orientated , anti-statist lib dems clustered around a volume of essays called the orange book , and those you might call conventional social democrats .
' hand signals ' but that 's a premonition of a row , a squall and a smudge on the horizon , not yet the real thing .
similarly , if you looked closely during the tory conference , you could see people lining up to argue with one another after the election .
boris johnson sits through yet another conference speech the biggest group around michael howard are moderates , who think the conservatives have to hold their nerve on centre-right policies , not lurching towards the uk independence party , or making wild promises on tax .
they are currently in the ascendant .
but there are potential leadership candidates on the right making personal hand-signals to the tory activists , who are now crucial to any succession , on issues like europe , tax and immigration .
' coup de theatre ' it is n't a fight - not now , not as we enter the winter whose spring might bring the election .
but if the tories lose , it will be a fight .
demonstrators strip to make their point about the pensions crisis my final thought about this conference season , however , is that it felt overshadowed .
there was the grim challenge of the iraq hostage crisis and ken bigley 's fate - felt particularly strongly during the liberal democrat and labour weeks .
there was the hartlepool by-election , in which the tories came fourth .
there was the confrontation between john kerry and george bush , and the report of the iraq survey group , which will have a far bigger impact on international affairs than anything said in a british party conference .
tony blair sings with the corus steel workers choir and there was the prime minister 's cool coup de theatre on the subject of his own future .
he waited until everyone had just left brighton .
power is n't with the party workers .
it 's a melancholy thought to end on , but we journalists have spent three weeks in conference centres , while hardly feeling central at all .

larry rudolph said he and the singer had " mutually agreed not to renew their nine-year management relationship " .
meanwhile , spears has also formalised her marriage with dancer kevin federline , almost three weeks after their los angeles ceremony .
spears , 22 , and federline , 26 , filed for their marriage licence on thursday , her publicist said .
" all the proper paperwork was dealt with today , filed , done .
it 's all legal , " said publicist , leslie sloane .
the pair married at a friend 's home in the studio city district of los angeles on 19 september but doubt was cast over the legality of the marriage after spears admitted no marriage licence had been submitted .
her personal life has been making headlines in recent months but she told people magazine - who had exclusive pictures and interviews from the wedding - they were married in " a real sense , a spiritual sense " .
in january , the louisiana-born singer married friend jason alexander in las vegas .
that marriage - described as a " joke " - was annulled 55 hours later .
the split with her manager marks a career turning-point for the star , who has sold more than 60 million albums since her debut hit baby one more time in 1999 .
" britney and i simply realised that we have done all we can do together , " said mr rudolph in a statement .
he is credited with discovering spears at the age of 13 and making her into one of the most successful recording artists in recent years .
ms sloane said no decisions about spears ' future management had been made and that the split from mr rudolph was amicable .

in new film bride and prejudice , which opens on friday , her best known work receives a bollywood make-over .
however much it might look like a bollywood movie , the resemblances between director gurinder chadha 's latest release and austen 's pride and prejudice are not hard to spot .
while it 's been moved to a provincial indian town - and given song and dance numbers - the basic premise is the same .
this time around , however , the film focuses on the bakshi family -lrb- instead of the bennets -rrb- who are trying to find suitors for their four daughters .
chadha makes no secret of the fact that austen 's novel served very closely as the source material for the film , so much so that the story is almost identical .
but she says the universal nature of austen 's stories allows them to be interpreted in any number of ways .
" our version may have different cultures and settings , but it 's still about people marrying from different backgrounds .
i wanted to combine british film tradition with bollywood - what better marriage than pride and prejudice ?
" it is very true to jane austen and the spirit of the book , and i think if she came down and went to see it in her local odeon she would like it . "
multiple adaptations but chadha is not the only person who 's been rushing to put austen 's much-loved work on the screen .
a more traditional version of the novel is due in cinemas in 2005 , this time starring keira knightley as lizzie bennet and spooks star matthew macfadyen as mr darcy .
colin firth won his heart-throb status as mr darcy the forthcoming version will mark the ninth time - including bride and prejudice - that the novel , in some shape or form , has been transferred to film or tv .
a little-known , very early tv version was made in 1938 , but it made its first successful transition from stage to screen with the 1940 film adaptation , starring laurence olivier as darcy and greer garson as lizzie bennet .
horror legend peter cushing also tried his hand at the role , opposite prunella scales in a 1952 small screen version .
and colin firth shot to stardom - and confirmed his heart-throb status - when he stepped into darcy 's breeches in a bbc tv version in 1995 .
currently , john leslie is touring the country in a theatrical version , playing the part of lizzie 's other would-be suitor , the caddish mr wickham .
another interpretation of the book found its way to the big screen last year .
pride and prejudice : a latter day comedy reset the novel in an american college , with lizzie portrayed as a conscientious student caught in a love traingle with good-looking playboy wickham and sensible businessman darcy .
the film , which starred a cast of unknowns , was released in the us last year but has yet to make it to the uk .
austen mania but it 's not just pride and prejudice which has been keeping film-makers busy in recent years - a whole spate of austen adaptations have graced big and small screens over the past decade .
bridget jones is a fan of austen 's hero they range from the high-profile -lrb- gwyneth paltrow in emma , kate winslet and emma thompson in sense and sensibility -rrb- through to 1999 's low-key film version of mansfield park , and the 1995 adaptation of persuasion , starring amanda root and ciaran hinds .
more modern spins on austen 's novels have included the 1995 hit clueless , which took the story of emma and set it in an affluent beverly hills high school .
and , bridget jones 's diary offers more than a passing nod to pride and prejudice - bridget is a mr darcy obsessive who ultimately ends up with a man called darcy -lrb- played , ironically enough , by colin firth -rrb- .
' contemporary and relevant ' given the enduring popularity of the books and attendant films , it looks as though austen mania will be with us for a while yet .
" the appeal of adapting austen is that her novels have more dramatic incident than a year 's worth of eastenders , " says ian freer , associate editor of film magazine empire .
" these are beautifully constructed stories of heartbreak and happiness populated by good-looking people and adorned with period finery which is the stuff of populist movies .
the fact that they also come with a set of social restrictions that can be translated into any environment - from a us high school in clueless to an inter-racial romance in bride and prejudice - increases their appeal as they still feel contemporary and relevant . "

in new film bride and prejudice , which opens on friday , her best known work receives a bollywood make-over .
however much it might look like a bollywood movie , the resemblances between director gurinder chadha 's latest release and austen 's pride and prejudice are not hard to spot .
while it 's been moved to a provincial indian town - and given song and dance numbers - the basic premise is the same .
this time around , however , the film focuses on the bakshi family -lrb- instead of the bennets -rrb- who are trying to find suitors for their four daughters .
chadha makes no secret of the fact that austen 's novel served very closely as the source material for the film , so much so that the story is almost identical .
but she says the universal nature of austen 's stories allows them to be interpreted in any number of ways .
" our version may have different cultures and settings , but it 's still about people marrying from different backgrounds .
i wanted to combine british film tradition with bollywood - what better marriage than pride and prejudice ?
" it is very true to jane austen and the spirit of the book , and i think if she came down and went to see it in her local odeon she would like it . "
multiple adaptations but chadha is not the only person who 's been rushing to put austen 's much-loved work on the screen .
a more traditional version of the novel is due in cinemas in 2005 , this time starring keira knightley as lizzie bennet and spooks star matthew macfadyen as mr darcy .
colin firth won his heart-throb status as mr darcy the forthcoming version will mark the ninth time - including bride and prejudice - that the novel , in some shape or form , has been transferred to film or tv .
a little-known , very early tv version was made in 1938 , but it made its first successful transition from stage to screen with the 1940 film adaptation , starring laurence olivier as darcy and greer garson as lizzie bennet .
horror legend peter cushing also tried his hand at the role , opposite prunella scales in a 1952 small screen version .
and colin firth shot to stardom - and confirmed his heart-throb status - when he stepped into darcy 's breeches in a bbc tv version in 1995 .
currently , john leslie is touring the country in a theatrical version , playing the part of lizzie 's other would-be suitor , the caddish mr wickham .
another interpretation of the book found its way to the big screen last year .
pride and prejudice : a latter day comedy reset the novel in an american college , with lizzie portrayed as a conscientious student caught in a love traingle with good-looking playboy wickham and sensible businessman darcy .
the film , which starred a cast of unknowns , was released in the us last year but has yet to make it to the uk .
austen mania but it 's not just pride and prejudice which has been keeping film-makers busy in recent years - a whole spate of austen adaptations have graced big and small screens over the past decade .
bridget jones is a fan of austen 's hero they range from the high-profile -lrb- gwyneth paltrow in emma , kate winslet and emma thompson in sense and sensibility -rrb- through to 1999 's low-key film version of mansfield park , and the 1995 adaptation of persuasion , starring amanda root and ciaran hinds .
more modern spins on austen 's novels have included the 1995 hit clueless , which took the story of emma and set it in an affluent beverly hills high school .
and , bridget jones 's diary offers more than a passing nod to pride and prejudice - bridget is a mr darcy obsessive who ultimately ends up with a man called darcy -lrb- played , ironically enough , by colin firth -rrb- .
' contemporary and relevant ' given the enduring popularity of the books and attendant films , it looks as though austen mania will be with us for a while yet .
" the appeal of adapting austen is that her novels have more dramatic incident than a year 's worth of eastenders , " says ian freer , associate editor of film magazine empire .
" these are beautifully constructed stories of heartbreak and happiness populated by good-looking people and adorned with period finery which is the stuff of populist movies .
the fact that they also come with a set of social restrictions that can be translated into any environment - from a us high school in clueless to an inter-racial romance in bride and prejudice - increases their appeal as they still feel contemporary and relevant . "

they range from the high-profile -lrb- gwyneth paltrow in emma , kate winslet and emma thompson in sense and sensibility -rrb- through to 1999 's low-key film version of mansfield park , and the 1995 adaptation of persuasion , starring amanda root and ciaran hinds .
more modern spins on austen 's novels have included the 1995 hit clueless , which took the story of emma and set it in an affluent beverly hills high school .
and , bridget jones 's diary offers more than a passing nod to pride and prejudice - bridget is a mr darcy obsessive who ultimately ends up with a man called darcy -lrb- played , ironically enough , by colin firth -rrb- .
' contemporary and relevant ' given the enduring popularity of the books and attendant films , it looks as though austen mania will be with us for a while yet .
" the appeal of adapting austen is that her novels have more dramatic incident than a year 's worth of eastenders , " says ian freer , associate editor of film magazine empire .
" these are beautifully constructed stories of heartbreak and happiness populated by good-looking people and adorned with period finery which is the stuff of populist movies .
the fact that they also come with a set of social restrictions that can be translated into any environment - from a us high school in clueless to an inter-racial romance in bride and prejudice - increases their appeal as they still feel contemporary and relevant . "
