he insisted she marry a man from turkey . in britain last year , abdalla yones , a kurdish muslim who stabbed his 16-year-old daughter , heshu , 11 times and slit her throat after she started a relationship with a christian boyfriend , was jailed for life . " honor killings , " as the phenomenon is known , usually involve women being murdered , usually by brothers and fathers , for having sex outside marriage , dating , refusing an arranged marriage , wanting to go to university or even having been raped .
the practice is not uncommon in traditional , male-dominated arab societies . fadime 's and heshu 's cases and others like them in europe have prompted calls for urgent action to protect young immigrants who fall out with their families and for police to reinvestigate murders suspected of having been honor killings . in a further sign that the phenomenon is being considered a serious problem , european police officials met at europol headquarters in the hague on tuesday with women 's organizations , social groups and academics to look at ways of tackling the issue and to exchange information and strategies .
the aim is to set up a pan-european unit to combat the killings and crack down on related issues such as trafficking in women . lack of awareness and statistics though experts say that honor killings are on the rise in europe , the problem is hobbled by a lack of awareness , mainly because the issue remains largely hidden from public view . in 2000 , the united nations estimated that around 5,000 girls and women in at least 14 countries , among them pakistan , jordan and turkey , were killed yearly because their families felt they brought dishonor on them . but statistics in europe are hard to come by given the fact that some honor-related crimes are recorded as simple murders or domestic violence . " in several european countries , cases similar to fadime 's of murder and violence have become increasingly common or more likely , they have been common for many years but have now started to become visible , " said a report by the swedish women 's advocacy group kvinnoforum , a sponsor of tuesday 's conference . mürea böhmecke of terres des femmes in germany , an organization for the protection of women that is beginning a campaign in november to raise awareness of honor killings , told dw-world , " there are no concrete statistics available , but unofficial estimates are considered to be high .
we get calls from women caught in difficult situations almost every two weeks . " breaking taboos experts say the problem is directly linked to the immigrant populations of the european countries . thus , according to böhmecke , most of germany 's honor-related crimes happen within the turkish population , the largest foreign group .
" many of them have been living here for years , speak perfect german and are well-integrated .
but they often call only after the violence has escalated , " böhmecke said . a spokeswoman for scotland yard told ap that many of britain 's cases came from south asian communities . experts agree that spreading awareness of the problem is the key , one which involves breaking taboos , given the fact that many cultures still accept family honor as a legitimate defense for a crime . andy baker , head of homicide investigations for new scotland yard , said at tuesday 's conference that honor killings in europe were a product of diverse cultures and alienation and that people were turning back to ancient traditions . sonya gmehling from the stuttgart-based association rosa , which offers in women above the age of 16 fleeing domestic violence and psychological torture anonymous shelter and counseling , told dw-world that the most important thing " is to build up the self-confidence of these battered women who are isolated . " in addition to educating authorities dealing with foreigners and young immigrants on the problem , gmehling suggested the subject should be dealt with by teachers in schools with high foreign populations . raising sensitivity böhmecke cited an example of a girl in her mid-20s from lebanon to reinforce the need to sensitize authorities to the problem . " the girl was hiding from her family when she approached us , " said böhmecke .
" one of her sisters was murdered by her father and brother several years ago in germany for having had an extramarital affair , and now her second sister was being held by her parents in an unknown place and was to be forcibly married off .
she wanted us to find her , " said böhmecke . " but we could n't do much except give up a missing ad , and then the police insisted the girl get in touch with them personally , " she said .
" but of course , she could n't because she had gone underground and was scared of being discovered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2004 opinion : turkey takes another stride towards the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a ways to go , though the council of europe has given turkey a positive report card regarding its democratic reforms .
but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency . " martial law was imposed over the entire country in 1978 and was later upheld as a state of emergency , a notch below the level of martial law , in parts of the country until two years ago . new challenges to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minaret of a local mosque in gelsenkirchen , western germany , is flanked by a german , left , and turkish flag .
there 's no doubt that turkey 's entry will pose completely new political challenges to the eu .
after all turkey 's 70 million citizens are almost exclusively muslims and thus members of a different religious community than the largely christian europe . but it 's exactly this difference in religion that gives europe the chance to prove that it 's capable and prepared for dialogue and peace with other cultures and faiths .
those who want a stable peace in europe need turkey as a bridge of trust between the orient and the occident , between east and west . dealing with islamic fundamentalism and blasphemous terrorism demands courage .
courage to look beyond one 's own christian existence and along with it to accept turkey as a country that wants to carry europe 's political values beyond its geographical borders . baha güngör -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pleasing eu means delaying terror trial in turkey a raft of reforms aimed at increasing turkey 's chances to get into the european union caused the unexpected delay of an al-qaeda terror trail - the court in which it was held was abolished .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .

we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .
everyone is blaming the technical staff for this loss but no one talks about the defensive errors that cost us two goals . " " but i think we are over-rated .
we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that . " he said .
" you win together , you lose together and that is what happened in the last match .
everyone is responsible for what happened . " latvia takes on holland with a possible , surprising qualification still within reach .
" if i 'd said 10 days ago that now i 'd be talking about qualifying for the quarter-finals it would have seemed like a joke , " said coach aleksandrs starkovs .
the latvians will not be overawed by the dutch , he added and that , match by match , his team 's confidence is growing . " we 've shown we can play big teams , " said starkovs , whose side could qualify if they beat the dutch and the czech republic do not lose to germany .
" we have a realistic chance to reach the quarter-finals . " latvia relishing every game " it 's already a victory to still be talking about making it into the last eight before the third group game .
we can play attacking football but - as against germany - we can play defensively and still create more chances than our opponents . " " the draw against germany is without a doubt our most significant international result because it was in an international tournament and because it was against the germans , " starkovs said .
" but our job now is to be ready to give our maximum against the netherlands . " a victory comes next , warns latvian stalwart latvia defender mihails zemlinskis told the team 's press conference that latvia was on a roll with their results getting better and better as the tournament progressed .
" we 've lost one match , we drew the second , and now it 's time for a victory , " said zemlinskis .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .
germany : kahn , friedrich , woerns , nowotny , lahm , frings , hamann , scheider , schweinsteiger , ballack , kuranyi .
czech republic : blazek , mares , rozehnal , bolf , jiranek , plasil , tyce , galasek , vachousek , heinz , lokvenc .

but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency . " martial law was imposed over the entire country in 1978 and was later upheld as a state of emergency , a notch below the level of martial law , in parts of the country until two years ago . new challenges to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minaret of a local mosque in gelsenkirchen , western germany , is flanked by a german , left , and turkish flag .

but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency .

he insisted she marry a man from turkey . in britain last year , abdalla yones , a kurdish muslim who stabbed his 16-year-old daughter , heshu , 11 times and slit her throat after she started a relationship with a christian boyfriend , was jailed for life . " honor killings , " as the phenomenon is known , usually involve women being murdered , usually by brothers and fathers , for having sex outside marriage , dating , refusing an arranged marriage , wanting to go to university or even having been raped .
the practice is not uncommon in traditional , male-dominated arab societies . fadime 's and heshu 's cases and others like them in europe have prompted calls for urgent action to protect young immigrants who fall out with their families and for police to reinvestigate murders suspected of having been honor killings . in a further sign that the phenomenon is being considered a serious problem , european police officials met at europol headquarters in the hague on tuesday with women 's organizations , social groups and academics to look at ways of tackling the issue and to exchange information and strategies .
the aim is to set up a pan-european unit to combat the killings and crack down on related issues such as trafficking in women . lack of awareness and statistics though experts say that honor killings are on the rise in europe , the problem is hobbled by a lack of awareness , mainly because the issue remains largely hidden from public view . in 2000 , the united nations estimated that around 5,000 girls and women in at least 14 countries , among them pakistan , jordan and turkey , were killed yearly because their families felt they brought dishonor on them . but statistics in europe are hard to come by given the fact that some honor-related crimes are recorded as simple murders or domestic violence . " in several european countries , cases similar to fadime 's of murder and violence have become increasingly common or more likely , they have been common for many years but have now started to become visible , " said a report by the swedish women 's advocacy group kvinnoforum , a sponsor of tuesday 's conference . mürea böhmecke of terres des femmes in germany , an organization for the protection of women that is beginning a campaign in november to raise awareness of honor killings , told dw-world , " there are no concrete statistics available , but unofficial estimates are considered to be high .
we get calls from women caught in difficult situations almost every two weeks . " breaking taboos experts say the problem is directly linked to the immigrant populations of the european countries . thus , according to böhmecke , most of germany 's honor-related crimes happen within the turkish population , the largest foreign group .

but they often call only after the violence has escalated , " böhmecke said . a spokeswoman for scotland yard told ap that many of britain 's cases came from south asian communities . experts agree that spreading awareness of the problem is the key , one which involves breaking taboos , given the fact that many cultures still accept family honor as a legitimate defense for a crime . andy baker , head of homicide investigations for new scotland yard , said at tuesday 's conference that honor killings in europe were a product of diverse cultures and alienation and that people were turning back to ancient traditions . sonya gmehling from the stuttgart-based association rosa , which offers in women above the age of 16 fleeing domestic violence and psychological torture anonymous shelter and counseling , told dw-world that the most important thing " is to build up the self-confidence of these battered women who are isolated .

it 's do or die on wednesday night , as germany must realistically defeat the czech republic to advance to the quarter-finals .
with the czechs already through , a german win would eliminate holland and latvia . despite only managing two draws in germany 's first two matches , coach rudi völler and his team remain confident of their chances to make it to the next round of euro 2004 .
the czech republic has already qualified , but the fate of the rest of group d will be decided on wednesday . a draw could theoretically suffice for germany if the netherlands and latvia also tied , but that 's not how german playmaker michael ballack and his teammates are heading into the game .
" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .
back then the germans managed to beat the czechs 2-1 after oliver bierhoff scored a " golden goal " to give germany its third european championship title .
but this time , after two strong opening matches , the czechs are the favorites to win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech star pavel nedved .
world-class midfielder and czech team captain pavel nedved led his side to come-from-behind victories against both latvia and the netherlands .
news that czech coach karl bruckner would rest nedved and other important starters could improve germany 's chances - but realistically not by much . the czech substitutes will be keen to make the most of their chance to show what they can do , increasing their incentive to give the germanys a good drubbing .
" those who have n't played here so far will want to prove to the coach they 're good enough to start , " said defender roman tyce . accordingly , german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn took little comfort knowing the czechs would likely field their b team .
" to think that this might be to our advantage would be the stupidest thing to do , " kahn said .
" every team that plays germany comes out to play hard .

the czech republic has already qualified , but the fate of the rest of group d will be decided on wednesday . a draw could theoretically suffice for germany if the netherlands and latvia also tied , but that 's not how german playmaker michael ballack and his teammates are heading into the game .
" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .
back then the germans managed to beat the czechs 2-1 after oliver bierhoff scored a " golden goal " to give germany its third european championship title .
but this time , after two strong opening matches , the czechs are the favorites to win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech star pavel nedved .
world-class midfielder and czech team captain pavel nedved led his side to come-from-behind victories against both latvia and the netherlands .
news that czech coach karl bruckner would rest nedved and other important starters could improve germany 's chances - but realistically not by much . the czech substitutes will be keen to make the most of their chance to show what they can do , increasing their incentive to give the germanys a good drubbing .
" those who have n't played here so far will want to prove to the coach they 're good enough to start , " said defender roman tyce . accordingly , german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn took little comfort knowing the czechs would likely field their b team .
" to think that this might be to our advantage would be the stupidest thing to do , " kahn said .

it 's do or die on wednesday night , as germany must realistically defeat the czech republic to advance to the quarter-finals .
with the czechs already through , a german win would eliminate holland and latvia . despite only managing two draws in germany 's first two matches , coach rudi völler and his team remain confident of their chances to make it to the next round of euro 2004 .
the czech republic has already qualified , but the fate of the rest of group d will be decided on wednesday . a draw could theoretically suffice for germany if the netherlands and latvia also tied , but that 's not how german playmaker michael ballack and his teammates are heading into the game .
" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .
back then the germans managed to beat the czechs 2-1 after oliver bierhoff scored a " golden goal " to give germany its third european championship title .
but this time , after two strong opening matches , the czechs are the favorites to win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech star pavel nedved .
world-class midfielder and czech team captain pavel nedved led his side to come-from-behind victories against both latvia and the netherlands .
news that czech coach karl bruckner would rest nedved and other important starters could improve germany 's chances - but realistically not by much . the czech substitutes will be keen to make the most of their chance to show what they can do , increasing their incentive to give the germanys a good drubbing .
" those who have n't played here so far will want to prove to the coach they 're good enough to start , " said defender roman tyce . accordingly , german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn took little comfort knowing the czechs would likely field their b team .
" to think that this might be to our advantage would be the stupidest thing to do , " kahn said .

it 's do or die on wednesday night , as germany must realistically defeat the czech republic to advance to the quarter-finals .
with the czechs already through , a german win would eliminate holland and latvia . despite only managing two draws in germany 's first two matches , coach rudi völler and his team remain confident of their chances to make it to the next round of euro 2004 .
the czech republic has already qualified , but the fate of the rest of group d will be decided on wednesday . a draw could theoretically suffice for germany if the netherlands and latvia also tied , but that 's not how german playmaker michael ballack and his teammates are heading into the game .
" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .
back then the germans managed to beat the czechs 2-1 after oliver bierhoff scored a " golden goal " to give germany its third european championship title .
but this time , after two strong opening matches , the czechs are the favorites to win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech star pavel nedved .
world-class midfielder and czech team captain pavel nedved led his side to come-from-behind victories against both latvia and the netherlands .
news that czech coach karl bruckner would rest nedved and other important starters could improve germany 's chances - but realistically not by much . the czech substitutes will be keen to make the most of their chance to show what they can do , increasing their incentive to give the germanys a good drubbing .
" those who have n't played here so far will want to prove to the coach they 're good enough to start , " said defender roman tyce . accordingly , german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn took little comfort knowing the czechs would likely field their b team .

toll collect , the german consortium responsible for developing and operating the system , said on tuesday that the most crucial parts of the satellite-based scheme worked with 99.6 percent precision .
over the past six months the consortium tested so-called on board units in 41 trucks that traveled more than 130,000 kilometers -lrb- 80,778 miles -rrb- on german highways . christoph bellmer , toll collects ’ s chief executive officer , claims the controversial technology is now working smoothly after technical problems held up the project for more than a year . " we were also able to prove that not only the on-board units functioned without problems but also the entire infrastructure behind them .
the system is now able to collect all the data and calculate exactly how much toll must be paid , " bellmer told dw-radio . bellmer replaced his hapless predecessor , hans-burghardt ziermann , at the helm of toll collect in march , after the government threatened to cancel the € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- contract in the wake of a series of technical failures .
in a last-minute deal with chancellor gerhard schröder , the owners of toll collect - among them telecommunications giant deutsche telekom and automaker daimlerchrysler - agreed to pay millions in compensation in exchange for a new chance and a pledge to take german engineering giant siemens on board at the consortium . now the truck toll system is set to become fully operational by january 1 , 2005 - exactly two years after original plans for its introduction . " one can not say it is working without a hitch , " hans-dieter otto , the owner of a german haulage company which took part in the recent test phase , said .
" there are still some places along highways where trucks are not automatically registered .
but they were only a few and toll collect is certainly able to fix that in time . " experts criticize test experts contend , however , that the testing involving only 41 trucks was little proof of the system 's reliability and that a second phase with around 4,000 trucks planned for this autumn will be the ultimate test .
the ambitious german toll system uses gps satellites to track the distance trucks travel on toll roads .
mobile phone equipment will then transmit billing data for processing . from 2005 , trucks on german autobahns are to be charged at least 12 cents per kilometer depending on their size and exhaust volume .
german haulage companies have long struggled against the introduction of a highway toll and view its introduction with skepticism . " this system is still very much cobbled together , " adolf zobel , head of the german association of haulage companies , said .
" if it really works will be uncertain until the very last day .
apart form that the system , of course , means an added financial burden for us . “ over the past year and a half , however , trucks using german autobahns have not been charged , since the government prematurely scrapped its old vignette system in the hope the new truck toll would be up and running by early 2003 .

toll collect , the german consortium responsible for developing and operating the system , said on tuesday that the most crucial parts of the satellite-based scheme worked with 99.6 percent precision .
over the past six months the consortium tested so-called on board units in 41 trucks that traveled more than 130,000 kilometers -lrb- 80,778 miles -rrb- on german highways . christoph bellmer , toll collects ’ s chief executive officer , claims the controversial technology is now working smoothly after technical problems held up the project for more than a year . " we were also able to prove that not only the on-board units functioned without problems but also the entire infrastructure behind them .
the system is now able to collect all the data and calculate exactly how much toll must be paid , " bellmer told dw-radio . bellmer replaced his hapless predecessor , hans-burghardt ziermann , at the helm of toll collect in march , after the government threatened to cancel the € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- contract in the wake of a series of technical failures .
in a last-minute deal with chancellor gerhard schröder , the owners of toll collect - among them telecommunications giant deutsche telekom and automaker daimlerchrysler - agreed to pay millions in compensation in exchange for a new chance and a pledge to take german engineering giant siemens on board at the consortium . now the truck toll system is set to become fully operational by january 1 , 2005 - exactly two years after original plans for its introduction . " one can not say it is working without a hitch , " hans-dieter otto , the owner of a german haulage company which took part in the recent test phase , said .
" there are still some places along highways where trucks are not automatically registered .
but they were only a few and toll collect is certainly able to fix that in time . " experts criticize test experts contend , however , that the testing involving only 41 trucks was little proof of the system 's reliability and that a second phase with around 4,000 trucks planned for this autumn will be the ultimate test .
the ambitious german toll system uses gps satellites to track the distance trucks travel on toll roads .
mobile phone equipment will then transmit billing data for processing . from 2005 , trucks on german autobahns are to be charged at least 12 cents per kilometer depending on their size and exhaust volume .
german haulage companies have long struggled against the introduction of a highway toll and view its introduction with skepticism . " this system is still very much cobbled together , " adolf zobel , head of the german association of haulage companies , said .
" if it really works will be uncertain until the very last day .
apart form that the system , of course , means an added financial burden for us . “ over the past year and a half , however , trucks using german autobahns have not been charged , since the government prematurely scrapped its old vignette system in the hope the new truck toll would be up and running by early 2003 .

13 , 1945 has been a potent symbol of the horrors of war .
the baroque frauenkirche , germany ’ s largest protestant church , was originally built in the heart of dresden in 1743 .
it miraculously survived two days and nights of the bombing , before succumbing to the 1,000 degree celsius heat generated by some 650,000 incendiary bombs that were dropped on the city .
the event not only leveled buildings , but also killed an estimated 135,000 people .

the building vanished from dresden 's skyline .
the ruins of the frauenkirche were a reminder of the horrors of that war , said allan russell from the dresden trust , in london .
" -lrb- the bombing of dresden -rrb- was an act of war designed to bring the war to the end , but it was a brutal act , " he told dw-radio .
in 1989 , a handful of residents in dresden formulated plans to rebuild the frauenkirche .
one early obstacle was a lack of funding , so in 1991 , the residents formed a society in support of rebuilding the cathedral and collected donations from around the world .
faithful reconstruction another issue was how to rebuild the church .
should it be altered in some way to represent the time that had passed between its construction and its downfall and the historical changes of that time span ?

reconstruction finally began in january 1993 .
now nearly completed , the frauenkirche can become a symbol of hope and peace , dresden trust 's russell said .
" we need to make a gesture back , to express our sorrow about the deaths and destruction and our determination to build things with our german friends for the future , " he said .
rebuilding the frauenkirche cost some € 130 million -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which was privately donated .
of the millions of stones used in the rebuilding , nearly 8,000 original stones were salvaged and set back in their place .
modern technology a computer imaging program which could move the stones three-dimensionally around the screen in various configurations was used to help architects find where the original stones sat and how they fit together .
the work will not end with setting of the church ’ s cupola and gilded cross on tuesday .
part of the frauenkirche ’ s dome and the interior of the cathedral still has to be completed .

that gave him a clear win over the council 's current secretary general , conservative austrian politician walter schwimmer , who received 91 votes , and the liberal estonian candidate , kristiina ojuland , with 51 votes . davis has been a member of the council 's parliamentary assembly for 12 years , and president of the socialist group in the assembly since 2002 .
davis said it was a " great honor " to be elected secretary general . " i have a vision of europe as part of a world where men and women are treated fairly and equally - a europe where people live in peace on the basis of mutual respect without any discrimination based on gender , sexual orientation , ethnic origin or religious belief , " davis said .
" the council of europe is the best way to turn that vision into a reality . " defender of human rights the council of europe , situated in strasbourg , france , is the continent 's oldest political organization .
it was founded in 1949 , and groups together 45 countries , including 21 countries from central and eastern europe . the council was set up to defend human rights and parliamentary democracy .
membership binds nations to uphold the european convention on human rights , which provides individual europeans the option to appeal human rights rulings in their own countries to the european court of human rights , also located in strasbourg . since 1989 , the council of europe 's main task has been to act as a human rights watchdog for europe 's post-communist democracies and to assist those countries in bringing about political , legal and constitutional reforms . cultural issues to take precedence speaking at a press conference after his election , davis said that in addition to human rights issues , he intends to focus on cultural issues during his five-year term , which begins on sept .
1 . " the council of europe should concentrate on culture , because european culture is far more than just the culture of the european union , " davis said .
" this area has not been given enough significance in the past . " when asked to explain what he saw as the difference between the council of europe and the european union , davis said that while the eu looks after the standard of living , the council of europe looks after quality of life . " of course there 'll be times when we overlap , but we should take care to avoid this because it wastes time , money and effort , " davis said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : turkey takes another stride towards the eu the council of europe has given turkey a positive report card regarding its democratic reforms .

" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .

stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .

germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .
for the next two months , it 's going to adorn josef 's bedroom walls .

saylan says that the operation is an option for women of all breast sizes , although he 's told reporters that it works best for " women with small , sagging breasts . " while saylan encourages his patients to keep wearing bras for about six months after the operation , he promises them firm forms sans bra in the end .
not too firm , though , as he said in an interview with a beauty magazine : " a bosom that 's too firm can look artificial .
we 're going for a natural appearance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. leipzig , the art world 's new mecca art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.06.2004 rent-a-painting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take your pick !
germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .
for the next two months , it 's going to adorn josef 's bedroom walls .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .
for the next two months , it 's going to adorn josef 's bedroom walls .

germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .
while the germans need victory to progress , the qualified czechs are unlikely to do germany any favors in their own quarter-final quest . germany needs a victory in lisbon on wednesday night to qualify for the quarter-finals of euro 2004 and will go all out to get one .
that 's the combative message coming from the german camp ahead of the crunch final game against the czech republic which rudi völler 's boys must win if they are to progress .
the czechs are already through and meet denmark in the knock-out phase ; germany has to dig deep to beat the in-form team in group b to grab the last quarter-final spot . " we have to win and i believe we can if we show some passion , " said völler .
the coach is plotting the czech republic 's downfall in style with playmaker michael ballack the man charged with providing the impetus that will take germany to the next round and the waiting swedes . " it is very important for us that michael can get into the box and into goal scoring positions .
he has worked hard and is now the focal point - he can cope with that . " established strikers have struggled völler has come under increased pressure from the media and fans back home to come up with a strike force that can improve on the current dismal record of just one goal in the opening two games of this tournament .
kevin kuranyi , fredi bobic and miroslav klose have all been employed in germany 's attacking formation but have yet to spark either together or individually . the calls from home have centered on 19-year-old lukas podolski , the fc cologne striker who was a surprise inclusion in the squad and has yet to make an appearance . ballack charged with scoring duties it seems more likely that völler will give ballack a more advanced role in the hope that the barcelona-bound midfielder will reproduce his world cup form where he was a driving force in germany 's route to the final .
ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .
" it is unfair to criticize the attackers when the goals do not come as it concerns the entire team rather than a few individuals , " he said .
" i am sure we can solve our attacking problems . " we have to improve our supply of crosses but if we come out with self-confidence and play to our potential , we can do it again . " midfielder sees team work as solution ballack himself was not to be lured in to assuming the mantle of germany 's goal scoring solution .
" i am not putting myself under pressure , " he told the team 's daily press conference on wednesday .
" it is not important whether i get the goals or someone else does as long as someone scores . " the czech republic has had no such problems with striker milan baros hitting his stride as the tournament heats up and the supporting midfield weighing in with influential service .
but with group d already won , the czechs are expected to rest several of their star players although baros is likely to start the game . " if nedved and galasek are not there , this may not necessarily be bad for us , " rudi völler said .
" but it 's really up to us - we have to show character and willpower . " " whatever line-up they use , they will come out to play hard - everybody wants to trip germany . " czechs want three wins out of three assistant coach miroslav beránek agreed that germany are a scalp that most teams want to capture and insisted the czechs would not be letting up against the germans . " we want to finish the group with a third victory in a row , " he said .
" our substitutes are hungry to finally get a game so they can prove themselves .
but the quarter-final is the most important thing for us right now , " he added . " the guys are motivated , they feel a chance they can prove themselves .

germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .
while the germans need victory to progress , the qualified czechs are unlikely to do germany any favors in their own quarter-final quest . germany needs a victory in lisbon on wednesday night to qualify for the quarter-finals of euro 2004 and will go all out to get one .
that 's the combative message coming from the german camp ahead of the crunch final game against the czech republic which rudi völler 's boys must win if they are to progress .
the czechs are already through and meet denmark in the knock-out phase ; germany has to dig deep to beat the in-form team in group b to grab the last quarter-final spot . " we have to win and i believe we can if we show some passion , " said völler .
the coach is plotting the czech republic 's downfall in style with playmaker michael ballack the man charged with providing the impetus that will take germany to the next round and the waiting swedes . " it is very important for us that michael can get into the box and into goal scoring positions .
he has worked hard and is now the focal point - he can cope with that . " established strikers have struggled völler has come under increased pressure from the media and fans back home to come up with a strike force that can improve on the current dismal record of just one goal in the opening two games of this tournament .
kevin kuranyi , fredi bobic and miroslav klose have all been employed in germany 's attacking formation but have yet to spark either together or individually . the calls from home have centered on 19-year-old lukas podolski , the fc cologne striker who was a surprise inclusion in the squad and has yet to make an appearance . ballack charged with scoring duties it seems more likely that völler will give ballack a more advanced role in the hope that the barcelona-bound midfielder will reproduce his world cup form where he was a driving force in germany 's route to the final .
ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .
" it is unfair to criticize the attackers when the goals do not come as it concerns the entire team rather than a few individuals , " he said .
" i am sure we can solve our attacking problems . " we have to improve our supply of crosses but if we come out with self-confidence and play to our potential , we can do it again . " midfielder sees team work as solution ballack himself was not to be lured in to assuming the mantle of germany 's goal scoring solution .
" i am not putting myself under pressure , " he told the team 's daily press conference on wednesday .
" it is not important whether i get the goals or someone else does as long as someone scores . " the czech republic has had no such problems with striker milan baros hitting his stride as the tournament heats up and the supporting midfield weighing in with influential service .
but with group d already won , the czechs are expected to rest several of their star players although baros is likely to start the game . " if nedved and galasek are not there , this may not necessarily be bad for us , " rudi völler said .
" but it 's really up to us - we have to show character and willpower . " " whatever line-up they use , they will come out to play hard - everybody wants to trip germany . " czechs want three wins out of three assistant coach miroslav beránek agreed that germany are a scalp that most teams want to capture and insisted the czechs would not be letting up against the germans . " we want to finish the group with a third victory in a row , " he said .
" our substitutes are hungry to finally get a game so they can prove themselves .
but the quarter-final is the most important thing for us right now , " he added . " the guys are motivated , they feel a chance they can prove themselves .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .
everyone is blaming the technical staff for this loss but no one talks about the defensive errors that cost us two goals . " " but i think we are over-rated .
we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that . " he said .
" you win together , you lose together and that is what happened in the last match .
everyone is responsible for what happened . " latvia takes on holland with a possible , surprising qualification still within reach .
" if i 'd said 10 days ago that now i 'd be talking about qualifying for the quarter-finals it would have seemed like a joke , " said coach aleksandrs starkovs .
the latvians will not be overawed by the dutch , he added and that , match by match , his team 's confidence is growing . " we 've shown we can play big teams , " said starkovs , whose side could qualify if they beat the dutch and the czech republic do not lose to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2004 europe grapples with " honor killings " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in the muslim world are frequent victims police officials from eu countries met at europol headquarters on tuesday to discuss " honor killings , " a disturbing problem on the rise in europe 's mainly middle eastern , arabic and asian immigrant communities . fadime sahindal , a 26-year-old turkish university student with a swedish boyfriend , was murdered by her father in sweden in 2002 .
he insisted she marry a man from turkey . in britain last year , abdalla yones , a kurdish muslim who stabbed his 16-year-old daughter , heshu , 11 times and slit her throat after she started a relationship with a christian boyfriend , was jailed for life . " honor killings , " as the phenomenon is known , usually involve women being murdered , usually by brothers and fathers , for having sex outside marriage , dating , refusing an arranged marriage , wanting to go to university or even having been raped .
the practice is not uncommon in traditional , male-dominated arab societies . fadime 's and heshu 's cases and others like them in europe have prompted calls for urgent action to protect young immigrants who fall out with their families and for police to reinvestigate murders suspected of having been honor killings . in a further sign that the phenomenon is being considered a serious problem , european police officials met at europol headquarters in the hague on tuesday with women 's organizations , social groups and academics to look at ways of tackling the issue and to exchange information and strategies .
the aim is to set up a pan-european unit to combat the killings and crack down on related issues such as trafficking in women . lack of awareness and statistics though experts say that honor killings are on the rise in europe , the problem is hobbled by a lack of awareness , mainly because the issue remains largely hidden from public view . in 2000 , the united nations estimated that around 5,000 girls and women in at least 14 countries , among them pakistan , jordan and turkey , were killed yearly because their families felt they brought dishonor on them . but statistics in europe are hard to come by given the fact that some honor-related crimes are recorded as simple murders or domestic violence . " in several european countries , cases similar to fadime 's of murder and violence have become increasingly common or more likely , they have been common for many years but have now started to become visible , " said a report by the swedish women 's advocacy group kvinnoforum , a sponsor of tuesday 's conference . mürea böhmecke of terres des femmes in germany , an organization for the protection of women that is beginning a campaign in november to raise awareness of honor killings , told dw-world , " there are no concrete statistics available , but unofficial estimates are considered to be high .
we get calls from women caught in difficult situations almost every two weeks . " breaking taboos experts say the problem is directly linked to the immigrant populations of the european countries . thus , according to böhmecke , most of germany 's honor-related crimes happen within the turkish population , the largest foreign group .
" many of them have been living here for years , speak perfect german and are well-integrated .
but they often call only after the violence has escalated , " böhmecke said . a spokeswoman for scotland yard told ap that many of britain 's cases came from south asian communities . experts agree that spreading awareness of the problem is the key , one which involves breaking taboos , given the fact that many cultures still accept family honor as a legitimate defense for a crime . andy baker , head of homicide investigations for new scotland yard , said at tuesday 's conference that honor killings in europe were a product of diverse cultures and alienation and that people were turning back to ancient traditions . sonya gmehling from the stuttgart-based association rosa , which offers in women above the age of 16 fleeing domestic violence and psychological torture anonymous shelter and counseling , told dw-world that the most important thing " is to build up the self-confidence of these battered women who are isolated . " in addition to educating authorities dealing with foreigners and young immigrants on the problem , gmehling suggested the subject should be dealt with by teachers in schools with high foreign populations . raising sensitivity böhmecke cited an example of a girl in her mid-20s from lebanon to reinforce the need to sensitize authorities to the problem . " the girl was hiding from her family when she approached us , " said böhmecke .
" one of her sisters was murdered by her father and brother several years ago in germany for having had an extramarital affair , and now her second sister was being held by her parents in an unknown place and was to be forcibly married off .
she wanted us to find her , " said böhmecke . " but we could n't do much except give up a missing ad , and then the police insisted the girl get in touch with them personally , " she said .
" but of course , she could n't because she had gone underground and was scared of being discovered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. leipzig , the art world 's new mecca art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.06.2004 rent-a-painting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take your pick !
germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .
for the next two months , it 's going to adorn josef 's bedroom walls .

" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .

standing in front of the german finance ministry in berlin on wednesday , fagan said german governments had profited from artworks that the nazis had allegedly stolen from the victims of the holocaust .
he said the finance ministry possessed 2,000 " tainted " works of art worth € 15 billion .

germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .
while the germans need victory to progress , the qualified czechs are unlikely to do germany any favors in their own quarter-final quest . germany needs a victory in lisbon on wednesday night to qualify for the quarter-finals of euro 2004 and will go all out to get one .
that 's the combative message coming from the german camp ahead of the crunch final game against the czech republic which rudi völler 's boys must win if they are to progress .
the czechs are already through and meet denmark in the knock-out phase ; germany has to dig deep to beat the in-form team in group b to grab the last quarter-final spot . " we have to win and i believe we can if we show some passion , " said völler .
the coach is plotting the czech republic 's downfall in style with playmaker michael ballack the man charged with providing the impetus that will take germany to the next round and the waiting swedes . " it is very important for us that michael can get into the box and into goal scoring positions .
he has worked hard and is now the focal point - he can cope with that . " established strikers have struggled völler has come under increased pressure from the media and fans back home to come up with a strike force that can improve on the current dismal record of just one goal in the opening two games of this tournament .
kevin kuranyi , fredi bobic and miroslav klose have all been employed in germany 's attacking formation but have yet to spark either together or individually . the calls from home have centered on 19-year-old lukas podolski , the fc cologne striker who was a surprise inclusion in the squad and has yet to make an appearance . ballack charged with scoring duties it seems more likely that völler will give ballack a more advanced role in the hope that the barcelona-bound midfielder will reproduce his world cup form where he was a driving force in germany 's route to the final .
ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .
" it is unfair to criticize the attackers when the goals do not come as it concerns the entire team rather than a few individuals , " he said .
" i am sure we can solve our attacking problems . " we have to improve our supply of crosses but if we come out with self-confidence and play to our potential , we can do it again . " midfielder sees team work as solution ballack himself was not to be lured in to assuming the mantle of germany 's goal scoring solution .
" i am not putting myself under pressure , " he told the team 's daily press conference on wednesday .
" it is not important whether i get the goals or someone else does as long as someone scores . " the czech republic has had no such problems with striker milan baros hitting his stride as the tournament heats up and the supporting midfield weighing in with influential service .
but with group d already won , the czechs are expected to rest several of their star players although baros is likely to start the game . " if nedved and galasek are not there , this may not necessarily be bad for us , " rudi völler said .
" but it 's really up to us - we have to show character and willpower . " " whatever line-up they use , they will come out to play hard - everybody wants to trip germany . " czechs want three wins out of three assistant coach miroslav beránek agreed that germany are a scalp that most teams want to capture and insisted the czechs would not be letting up against the germans . " we want to finish the group with a third victory in a row , " he said .
" our substitutes are hungry to finally get a game so they can prove themselves .
but the quarter-final is the most important thing for us right now , " he added . " the guys are motivated , they feel a chance they can prove themselves .
we still want to win though ; it 's good for our self-confidence .

ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .

germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .
while the germans need victory to progress , the qualified czechs are unlikely to do germany any favors in their own quarter-final quest . germany needs a victory in lisbon on wednesday night to qualify for the quarter-finals of euro 2004 and will go all out to get one .
that 's the combative message coming from the german camp ahead of the crunch final game against the czech republic which rudi völler 's boys must win if they are to progress .
the czechs are already through and meet denmark in the knock-out phase ; germany has to dig deep to beat the in-form team in group b to grab the last quarter-final spot . " we have to win and i believe we can if we show some passion , " said völler .
the coach is plotting the czech republic 's downfall in style with playmaker michael ballack the man charged with providing the impetus that will take germany to the next round and the waiting swedes . " it is very important for us that michael can get into the box and into goal scoring positions .
he has worked hard and is now the focal point - he can cope with that . " established strikers have struggled völler has come under increased pressure from the media and fans back home to come up with a strike force that can improve on the current dismal record of just one goal in the opening two games of this tournament .
kevin kuranyi , fredi bobic and miroslav klose have all been employed in germany 's attacking formation but have yet to spark either together or individually . the calls from home have centered on 19-year-old lukas podolski , the fc cologne striker who was a surprise inclusion in the squad and has yet to make an appearance . ballack charged with scoring duties it seems more likely that völler will give ballack a more advanced role in the hope that the barcelona-bound midfielder will reproduce his world cup form where he was a driving force in germany 's route to the final .
ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .
" it is unfair to criticize the attackers when the goals do not come as it concerns the entire team rather than a few individuals , " he said .
" i am sure we can solve our attacking problems . " we have to improve our supply of crosses but if we come out with self-confidence and play to our potential , we can do it again . " midfielder sees team work as solution ballack himself was not to be lured in to assuming the mantle of germany 's goal scoring solution .

he insisted she marry a man from turkey . in britain last year , abdalla yones , a kurdish muslim who stabbed his 16-year-old daughter , heshu , 11 times and slit her throat after she started a relationship with a christian boyfriend , was jailed for life . " honor killings , " as the phenomenon is known , usually involve women being murdered , usually by brothers and fathers , for having sex outside marriage , dating , refusing an arranged marriage , wanting to go to university or even having been raped .
the practice is not uncommon in traditional , male-dominated arab societies . fadime 's and heshu 's cases and others like them in europe have prompted calls for urgent action to protect young immigrants who fall out with their families and for police to reinvestigate murders suspected of having been honor killings . in a further sign that the phenomenon is being considered a serious problem , european police officials met at europol headquarters in the hague on tuesday with women 's organizations , social groups and academics to look at ways of tackling the issue and to exchange information and strategies .
the aim is to set up a pan-european unit to combat the killings and crack down on related issues such as trafficking in women . lack of awareness and statistics though experts say that honor killings are on the rise in europe , the problem is hobbled by a lack of awareness , mainly because the issue remains largely hidden from public view . in 2000 , the united nations estimated that around 5,000 girls and women in at least 14 countries , among them pakistan , jordan and turkey , were killed yearly because their families felt they brought dishonor on them . but statistics in europe are hard to come by given the fact that some honor-related crimes are recorded as simple murders or domestic violence . " in several european countries , cases similar to fadime 's of murder and violence have become increasingly common or more likely , they have been common for many years but have now started to become visible , " said a report by the swedish women 's advocacy group kvinnoforum , a sponsor of tuesday 's conference . mürea böhmecke of terres des femmes in germany , an organization for the protection of women that is beginning a campaign in november to raise awareness of honor killings , told dw-world , " there are no concrete statistics available , but unofficial estimates are considered to be high .
we get calls from women caught in difficult situations almost every two weeks . " breaking taboos experts say the problem is directly linked to the immigrant populations of the european countries . thus , according to böhmecke , most of germany 's honor-related crimes happen within the turkish population , the largest foreign group .
" many of them have been living here for years , speak perfect german and are well-integrated .
but they often call only after the violence has escalated , " böhmecke said . a spokeswoman for scotland yard told ap that many of britain 's cases came from south asian communities . experts agree that spreading awareness of the problem is the key , one which involves breaking taboos , given the fact that many cultures still accept family honor as a legitimate defense for a crime . andy baker , head of homicide investigations for new scotland yard , said at tuesday 's conference that honor killings in europe were a product of diverse cultures and alienation and that people were turning back to ancient traditions . sonya gmehling from the stuttgart-based association rosa , which offers in women above the age of 16 fleeing domestic violence and psychological torture anonymous shelter and counseling , told dw-world that the most important thing " is to build up the self-confidence of these battered women who are isolated . " in addition to educating authorities dealing with foreigners and young immigrants on the problem , gmehling suggested the subject should be dealt with by teachers in schools with high foreign populations . raising sensitivity böhmecke cited an example of a girl in her mid-20s from lebanon to reinforce the need to sensitize authorities to the problem . " the girl was hiding from her family when she approached us , " said böhmecke .
" one of her sisters was murdered by her father and brother several years ago in germany for having had an extramarital affair , and now her second sister was being held by her parents in an unknown place and was to be forcibly married off .

he insisted she marry a man from turkey . in britain last year , abdalla yones , a kurdish muslim who stabbed his 16-year-old daughter , heshu , 11 times and slit her throat after she started a relationship with a christian boyfriend , was jailed for life . " honor killings , " as the phenomenon is known , usually involve women being murdered , usually by brothers and fathers , for having sex outside marriage , dating , refusing an arranged marriage , wanting to go to university or even having been raped .
the practice is not uncommon in traditional , male-dominated arab societies . fadime 's and heshu 's cases and others like them in europe have prompted calls for urgent action to protect young immigrants who fall out with their families and for police to reinvestigate murders suspected of having been honor killings . in a further sign that the phenomenon is being considered a serious problem , european police officials met at europol headquarters in the hague on tuesday with women 's organizations , social groups and academics to look at ways of tackling the issue and to exchange information and strategies .
the aim is to set up a pan-european unit to combat the killings and crack down on related issues such as trafficking in women . lack of awareness and statistics though experts say that honor killings are on the rise in europe , the problem is hobbled by a lack of awareness , mainly because the issue remains largely hidden from public view . in 2000 , the united nations estimated that around 5,000 girls and women in at least 14 countries , among them pakistan , jordan and turkey , were killed yearly because their families felt they brought dishonor on them . but statistics in europe are hard to come by given the fact that some honor-related crimes are recorded as simple murders or domestic violence . " in several european countries , cases similar to fadime 's of murder and violence have become increasingly common or more likely , they have been common for many years but have now started to become visible , " said a report by the swedish women 's advocacy group kvinnoforum , a sponsor of tuesday 's conference . mürea böhmecke of terres des femmes in germany , an organization for the protection of women that is beginning a campaign in november to raise awareness of honor killings , told dw-world , " there are no concrete statistics available , but unofficial estimates are considered to be high .
we get calls from women caught in difficult situations almost every two weeks . " breaking taboos experts say the problem is directly linked to the immigrant populations of the european countries . thus , according to böhmecke , most of germany 's honor-related crimes happen within the turkish population , the largest foreign group .
" many of them have been living here for years , speak perfect german and are well-integrated .
but they often call only after the violence has escalated , " böhmecke said . a spokeswoman for scotland yard told ap that many of britain 's cases came from south asian communities . experts agree that spreading awareness of the problem is the key , one which involves breaking taboos , given the fact that many cultures still accept family honor as a legitimate defense for a crime . andy baker , head of homicide investigations for new scotland yard , said at tuesday 's conference that honor killings in europe were a product of diverse cultures and alienation and that people were turning back to ancient traditions . sonya gmehling from the stuttgart-based association rosa , which offers in women above the age of 16 fleeing domestic violence and psychological torture anonymous shelter and counseling , told dw-world that the most important thing " is to build up the self-confidence of these battered women who are isolated . " in addition to educating authorities dealing with foreigners and young immigrants on the problem , gmehling suggested the subject should be dealt with by teachers in schools with high foreign populations . raising sensitivity böhmecke cited an example of a girl in her mid-20s from lebanon to reinforce the need to sensitize authorities to the problem . " the girl was hiding from her family when she approached us , " said böhmecke .
" one of her sisters was murdered by her father and brother several years ago in germany for having had an extramarital affair , and now her second sister was being held by her parents in an unknown place and was to be forcibly married off .

the aim is to set up a pan-european unit to combat the killings and crack down on related issues such as trafficking in women . lack of awareness and statistics though experts say that honor killings are on the rise in europe , the problem is hobbled by a lack of awareness , mainly because the issue remains largely hidden from public view . in 2000 , the united nations estimated that around 5,000 girls and women in at least 14 countries , among them pakistan , jordan and turkey , were killed yearly because their families felt they brought dishonor on them . but statistics in europe are hard to come by given the fact that some honor-related crimes are recorded as simple murders or domestic violence . " in several european countries , cases similar to fadime 's of murder and violence have become increasingly common or more likely , they have been common for many years but have now started to become visible , " said a report by the swedish women 's advocacy group kvinnoforum , a sponsor of tuesday 's conference . mürea böhmecke of terres des femmes in germany , an organization for the protection of women that is beginning a campaign in november to raise awareness of honor killings , told dw-world , " there are no concrete statistics available , but unofficial estimates are considered to be high .
we get calls from women caught in difficult situations almost every two weeks . " breaking taboos experts say the problem is directly linked to the immigrant populations of the european countries . thus , according to böhmecke , most of germany 's honor-related crimes happen within the turkish population , the largest foreign group .
" many of them have been living here for years , speak perfect german and are well-integrated .
but they often call only after the violence has escalated , " böhmecke said . a spokeswoman for scotland yard told ap that many of britain 's cases came from south asian communities . experts agree that spreading awareness of the problem is the key , one which involves breaking taboos , given the fact that many cultures still accept family honor as a legitimate defense for a crime . andy baker , head of homicide investigations for new scotland yard , said at tuesday 's conference that honor killings in europe were a product of diverse cultures and alienation and that people were turning back to ancient traditions . sonya gmehling from the stuttgart-based association rosa , which offers in women above the age of 16 fleeing domestic violence and psychological torture anonymous shelter and counseling , told dw-world that the most important thing " is to build up the self-confidence of these battered women who are isolated . " in addition to educating authorities dealing with foreigners and young immigrants on the problem , gmehling suggested the subject should be dealt with by teachers in schools with high foreign populations . raising sensitivity böhmecke cited an example of a girl in her mid-20s from lebanon to reinforce the need to sensitize authorities to the problem . " the girl was hiding from her family when she approached us , " said böhmecke .
" one of her sisters was murdered by her father and brother several years ago in germany for having had an extramarital affair , and now her second sister was being held by her parents in an unknown place and was to be forcibly married off .
she wanted us to find her , " said böhmecke . " but we could n't do much except give up a missing ad , and then the police insisted the girl get in touch with them personally , " she said .
" but of course , she could n't because she had gone underground and was scared of being discovered .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .

we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that . " he said .
" you win together , you lose together and that is what happened in the last match .
everyone is responsible for what happened . " latvia takes on holland with a possible , surprising qualification still within reach .
" if i 'd said 10 days ago that now i 'd be talking about qualifying for the quarter-finals it would have seemed like a joke , " said coach aleksandrs starkovs .
the latvians will not be overawed by the dutch , he added and that , match by match , his team 's confidence is growing . " we 've shown we can play big teams , " said starkovs , whose side could qualify if they beat the dutch and the czech republic do not lose to germany .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 23.06.2004 dutch threaten bar-room brawl at last chance saloon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland coach dick advocaat is under fire from all sides the dutch are staring elimination in the face before the game against latvia on wednesday .
but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .
everyone is blaming the technical staff for this loss but no one talks about the defensive errors that cost us two goals . " " but i think we are over-rated .
we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that . " he said .
" you win together , you lose together and that is what happened in the last match .
everyone is responsible for what happened . " latvia takes on holland with a possible , surprising qualification still within reach .
" if i 'd said 10 days ago that now i 'd be talking about qualifying for the quarter-finals it would have seemed like a joke , " said coach aleksandrs starkovs .
the latvians will not be overawed by the dutch , he added and that , match by match , his team 's confidence is growing . " we 've shown we can play big teams , " said starkovs , whose side could qualify if they beat the dutch and the czech republic do not lose to germany .
" we have a realistic chance to reach the quarter-finals . " latvia relishing every game " it 's already a victory to still be talking about making it into the last eight before the third group game .
we can play attacking football but - as against germany - we can play defensively and still create more chances than our opponents .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .

latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

jerzy broniowski , a polish national born in 1944 , brought his case to the court seeking compensation of € 85,000 -lrb- $ 103,000 -rrb- for his grandmother ’ s lost property - a house and land in what is now lviv , ukraine .
the case has much wider significance because it opens the door for more than 80,000 potential claims in poland , according to government estimations .
in addition to poles , millions of germans were expelled from their homes when borders were settled after world war ii .
the polish government last year adopted a compensation law that would pay out 15 percent of the value of lost property with a ceiling of 50,000 polish zlotys -lrb- € 11,000 -rrb- .

over the past six months the consortium tested so-called on board units in 41 trucks that traveled more than 130,000 kilometers -lrb- 80,778 miles -rrb- on german highways . christoph bellmer , toll collects ’ s chief executive officer , claims the controversial technology is now working smoothly after technical problems held up the project for more than a year . " we were also able to prove that not only the on-board units functioned without problems but also the entire infrastructure behind them .
the system is now able to collect all the data and calculate exactly how much toll must be paid , " bellmer told dw-radio . bellmer replaced his hapless predecessor , hans-burghardt ziermann , at the helm of toll collect in march , after the government threatened to cancel the € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- contract in the wake of a series of technical failures .
in a last-minute deal with chancellor gerhard schröder , the owners of toll collect - among them telecommunications giant deutsche telekom and automaker daimlerchrysler - agreed to pay millions in compensation in exchange for a new chance and a pledge to take german engineering giant siemens on board at the consortium . now the truck toll system is set to become fully operational by january 1 , 2005 - exactly two years after original plans for its introduction . " one can not say it is working without a hitch , " hans-dieter otto , the owner of a german haulage company which took part in the recent test phase , said .
" there are still some places along highways where trucks are not automatically registered .
but they were only a few and toll collect is certainly able to fix that in time . " experts criticize test experts contend , however , that the testing involving only 41 trucks was little proof of the system 's reliability and that a second phase with around 4,000 trucks planned for this autumn will be the ultimate test .
the ambitious german toll system uses gps satellites to track the distance trucks travel on toll roads .
mobile phone equipment will then transmit billing data for processing . from 2005 , trucks on german autobahns are to be charged at least 12 cents per kilometer depending on their size and exhaust volume .
german haulage companies have long struggled against the introduction of a highway toll and view its introduction with skepticism . " this system is still very much cobbled together , " adolf zobel , head of the german association of haulage companies , said .
" if it really works will be uncertain until the very last day .
apart form that the system , of course , means an added financial burden for us . “ over the past year and a half , however , trucks using german autobahns have not been charged , since the government prematurely scrapped its old vignette system in the hope the new truck toll would be up and running by early 2003 .
the delays led to an estimated shortfall of € 3 billion in german state coffers last year alone and has jeopardized a series of big transport investments in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom pays dearly for toll system delay german telecoms giant deutsche telekom announced on wednesday that it was back in the black , registering a net profit of € 1.253 billion -lrb- $ 1.54 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared with a record € 24.6 billion loss a year earlier .

toll collect , the german consortium responsible for developing and operating the system , said on tuesday that the most crucial parts of the satellite-based scheme worked with 99.6 percent precision .
over the past six months the consortium tested so-called on board units in 41 trucks that traveled more than 130,000 kilometers -lrb- 80,778 miles -rrb- on german highways . christoph bellmer , toll collects ’ s chief executive officer , claims the controversial technology is now working smoothly after technical problems held up the project for more than a year . " we were also able to prove that not only the on-board units functioned without problems but also the entire infrastructure behind them .
the system is now able to collect all the data and calculate exactly how much toll must be paid , " bellmer told dw-radio . bellmer replaced his hapless predecessor , hans-burghardt ziermann , at the helm of toll collect in march , after the government threatened to cancel the € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- contract in the wake of a series of technical failures .
in a last-minute deal with chancellor gerhard schröder , the owners of toll collect - among them telecommunications giant deutsche telekom and automaker daimlerchrysler - agreed to pay millions in compensation in exchange for a new chance and a pledge to take german engineering giant siemens on board at the consortium . now the truck toll system is set to become fully operational by january 1 , 2005 - exactly two years after original plans for its introduction . " one can not say it is working without a hitch , " hans-dieter otto , the owner of a german haulage company which took part in the recent test phase , said .
" there are still some places along highways where trucks are not automatically registered .
but they were only a few and toll collect is certainly able to fix that in time . " experts criticize test experts contend , however , that the testing involving only 41 trucks was little proof of the system 's reliability and that a second phase with around 4,000 trucks planned for this autumn will be the ultimate test .
the ambitious german toll system uses gps satellites to track the distance trucks travel on toll roads .
mobile phone equipment will then transmit billing data for processing . from 2005 , trucks on german autobahns are to be charged at least 12 cents per kilometer depending on their size and exhaust volume .
german haulage companies have long struggled against the introduction of a highway toll and view its introduction with skepticism . " this system is still very much cobbled together , " adolf zobel , head of the german association of haulage companies , said .
" if it really works will be uncertain until the very last day .
apart form that the system , of course , means an added financial burden for us . “ over the past year and a half , however , trucks using german autobahns have not been charged , since the government prematurely scrapped its old vignette system in the hope the new truck toll would be up and running by early 2003 .

it 's do or die on wednesday night , as germany must realistically defeat the czech republic to advance to the quarter-finals .
with the czechs already through , a german win would eliminate holland and latvia . despite only managing two draws in germany 's first two matches , coach rudi völler and his team remain confident of their chances to make it to the next round of euro 2004 .
the czech republic has already qualified , but the fate of the rest of group d will be decided on wednesday . a draw could theoretically suffice for germany if the netherlands and latvia also tied , but that 's not how german playmaker michael ballack and his teammates are heading into the game .
" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .
back then the germans managed to beat the czechs 2-1 after oliver bierhoff scored a " golden goal " to give germany its third european championship title .
but this time , after two strong opening matches , the czechs are the favorites to win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech star pavel nedved .
world-class midfielder and czech team captain pavel nedved led his side to come-from-behind victories against both latvia and the netherlands .
news that czech coach karl bruckner would rest nedved and other important starters could improve germany 's chances - but realistically not by much . the czech substitutes will be keen to make the most of their chance to show what they can do , increasing their incentive to give the germanys a good drubbing .
" those who have n't played here so far will want to prove to the coach they 're good enough to start , " said defender roman tyce . accordingly , german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn took little comfort knowing the czechs would likely field their b team .
" to think that this might be to our advantage would be the stupidest thing to do , " kahn said .
" every team that plays germany comes out to play hard .

" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .
back then the germans managed to beat the czechs 2-1 after oliver bierhoff scored a " golden goal " to give germany its third european championship title .
but this time , after two strong opening matches , the czechs are the favorites to win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech star pavel nedved .
world-class midfielder and czech team captain pavel nedved led his side to come-from-behind victories against both latvia and the netherlands .
news that czech coach karl bruckner would rest nedved and other important starters could improve germany 's chances - but realistically not by much . the czech substitutes will be keen to make the most of their chance to show what they can do , increasing their incentive to give the germanys a good drubbing .
" those who have n't played here so far will want to prove to the coach they 're good enough to start , " said defender roman tyce . accordingly , german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn took little comfort knowing the czechs would likely field their b team .
" to think that this might be to our advantage would be the stupidest thing to do , " kahn said .
" every team that plays germany comes out to play hard .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .
germany : kahn , friedrich , woerns , nowotny , lahm , frings , hamann , scheider , schweinsteiger , ballack , kuranyi .

germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. leipzig , the art world 's new mecca art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.06.2004 rent-a-painting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take your pick !
germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .
for the next two months , it 's going to adorn josef 's bedroom walls .

toll collect , the german consortium responsible for developing and operating the system , said on tuesday that the most crucial parts of the satellite-based scheme worked with 99.6 percent precision .
over the past six months the consortium tested so-called on board units in 41 trucks that traveled more than 130,000 kilometers -lrb- 80,778 miles -rrb- on german highways . christoph bellmer , toll collects ’ s chief executive officer , claims the controversial technology is now working smoothly after technical problems held up the project for more than a year . " we were also able to prove that not only the on-board units functioned without problems but also the entire infrastructure behind them .
the system is now able to collect all the data and calculate exactly how much toll must be paid , " bellmer told dw-radio . bellmer replaced his hapless predecessor , hans-burghardt ziermann , at the helm of toll collect in march , after the government threatened to cancel the € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- contract in the wake of a series of technical failures .
in a last-minute deal with chancellor gerhard schröder , the owners of toll collect - among them telecommunications giant deutsche telekom and automaker daimlerchrysler - agreed to pay millions in compensation in exchange for a new chance and a pledge to take german engineering giant siemens on board at the consortium . now the truck toll system is set to become fully operational by january 1 , 2005 - exactly two years after original plans for its introduction . " one can not say it is working without a hitch , " hans-dieter otto , the owner of a german haulage company which took part in the recent test phase , said .
" there are still some places along highways where trucks are not automatically registered .
but they were only a few and toll collect is certainly able to fix that in time . " experts criticize test experts contend , however , that the testing involving only 41 trucks was little proof of the system 's reliability and that a second phase with around 4,000 trucks planned for this autumn will be the ultimate test .
the ambitious german toll system uses gps satellites to track the distance trucks travel on toll roads .
mobile phone equipment will then transmit billing data for processing . from 2005 , trucks on german autobahns are to be charged at least 12 cents per kilometer depending on their size and exhaust volume .
german haulage companies have long struggled against the introduction of a highway toll and view its introduction with skepticism . " this system is still very much cobbled together , " adolf zobel , head of the german association of haulage companies , said .
" if it really works will be uncertain until the very last day .
apart form that the system , of course , means an added financial burden for us . “ over the past year and a half , however , trucks using german autobahns have not been charged , since the government prematurely scrapped its old vignette system in the hope the new truck toll would be up and running by early 2003 .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .

the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .

saylan says that the operation is an option for women of all breast sizes , although he 's told reporters that it works best for " women with small , sagging breasts . " while saylan encourages his patients to keep wearing bras for about six months after the operation , he promises them firm forms sans bra in the end .
not too firm , though , as he said in an interview with a beauty magazine : " a bosom that 's too firm can look artificial .
we 're going for a natural appearance .
nice breasts can sag a little , as leonardo da vinci already discovered . " some of his colleagues caution that the implant makes it impossible for women to check their breasts for tumors themselves .
" there can be some problems with that , " saylan told dw-world , but said that regular mammograms or x-rays would still help to detect cancerous growths at an early stage . still , saylan 's unlikely to convince a huge amount of women to abandon their bras .
at a price tag of € 7,000 -lrb- $ 8,450 -rrb- , the operation costs about as much as 150 " bust-holders , " as bras are known in german . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish town 's bold bid for publicity just weeks before entering into what has - until now - been western europe 's most exclusive club , a small polish town has decided its coat of arms needs to comply with western beauty standards .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2004 opinion : turkey takes another stride towards the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a ways to go , though the council of europe has given turkey a positive report card regarding its democratic reforms .
but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency . " martial law was imposed over the entire country in 1978 and was later upheld as a state of emergency , a notch below the level of martial law , in parts of the country until two years ago . new challenges to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minaret of a local mosque in gelsenkirchen , western germany , is flanked by a german , left , and turkish flag .
there 's no doubt that turkey 's entry will pose completely new political challenges to the eu .
after all turkey 's 70 million citizens are almost exclusively muslims and thus members of a different religious community than the largely christian europe . but it 's exactly this difference in religion that gives europe the chance to prove that it 's capable and prepared for dialogue and peace with other cultures and faiths .
those who want a stable peace in europe need turkey as a bridge of trust between the orient and the occident , between east and west . dealing with islamic fundamentalism and blasphemous terrorism demands courage .
courage to look beyond one 's own christian existence and along with it to accept turkey as a country that wants to carry europe 's political values beyond its geographical borders . baha güngör -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pleasing eu means delaying terror trial in turkey a raft of reforms aimed at increasing turkey 's chances to get into the european union caused the unexpected delay of an al-qaeda terror trail - the court in which it was held was abolished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2004 opinion : turkey takes another stride towards the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a ways to go , though the council of europe has given turkey a positive report card regarding its democratic reforms .
but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency . " martial law was imposed over the entire country in 1978 and was later upheld as a state of emergency , a notch below the level of martial law , in parts of the country until two years ago . new challenges to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minaret of a local mosque in gelsenkirchen , western germany , is flanked by a german , left , and turkish flag .
there 's no doubt that turkey 's entry will pose completely new political challenges to the eu .
after all turkey 's 70 million citizens are almost exclusively muslims and thus members of a different religious community than the largely christian europe . but it 's exactly this difference in religion that gives europe the chance to prove that it 's capable and prepared for dialogue and peace with other cultures and faiths .
those who want a stable peace in europe need turkey as a bridge of trust between the orient and the occident , between east and west . dealing with islamic fundamentalism and blasphemous terrorism demands courage .
courage to look beyond one 's own christian existence and along with it to accept turkey as a country that wants to carry europe 's political values beyond its geographical borders . baha güngör -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pleasing eu means delaying terror trial in turkey a raft of reforms aimed at increasing turkey 's chances to get into the european union caused the unexpected delay of an al-qaeda terror trail - the court in which it was held was abolished .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

toll collect , the german consortium responsible for developing and operating the system , said on tuesday that the most crucial parts of the satellite-based scheme worked with 99.6 percent precision .
over the past six months the consortium tested so-called on board units in 41 trucks that traveled more than 130,000 kilometers -lrb- 80,778 miles -rrb- on german highways . christoph bellmer , toll collects ’ s chief executive officer , claims the controversial technology is now working smoothly after technical problems held up the project for more than a year . " we were also able to prove that not only the on-board units functioned without problems but also the entire infrastructure behind them .
the system is now able to collect all the data and calculate exactly how much toll must be paid , " bellmer told dw-radio . bellmer replaced his hapless predecessor , hans-burghardt ziermann , at the helm of toll collect in march , after the government threatened to cancel the € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- contract in the wake of a series of technical failures .
in a last-minute deal with chancellor gerhard schröder , the owners of toll collect - among them telecommunications giant deutsche telekom and automaker daimlerchrysler - agreed to pay millions in compensation in exchange for a new chance and a pledge to take german engineering giant siemens on board at the consortium . now the truck toll system is set to become fully operational by january 1 , 2005 - exactly two years after original plans for its introduction . " one can not say it is working without a hitch , " hans-dieter otto , the owner of a german haulage company which took part in the recent test phase , said .
" there are still some places along highways where trucks are not automatically registered .
but they were only a few and toll collect is certainly able to fix that in time . " experts criticize test experts contend , however , that the testing involving only 41 trucks was little proof of the system 's reliability and that a second phase with around 4,000 trucks planned for this autumn will be the ultimate test .
the ambitious german toll system uses gps satellites to track the distance trucks travel on toll roads .
mobile phone equipment will then transmit billing data for processing . from 2005 , trucks on german autobahns are to be charged at least 12 cents per kilometer depending on their size and exhaust volume .
german haulage companies have long struggled against the introduction of a highway toll and view its introduction with skepticism . " this system is still very much cobbled together , " adolf zobel , head of the german association of haulage companies , said .
" if it really works will be uncertain until the very last day .
apart form that the system , of course , means an added financial burden for us . “ over the past year and a half , however , trucks using german autobahns have not been charged , since the government prematurely scrapped its old vignette system in the hope the new truck toll would be up and running by early 2003 .
the delays led to an estimated shortfall of € 3 billion in german state coffers last year alone and has jeopardized a series of big transport investments in germany . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de telekom pays dearly for toll system delay german telecoms giant deutsche telekom announced on wednesday that it was back in the black , registering a net profit of € 1.253 billion -lrb- $ 1.54 billion -rrb- in 2003 , compared with a record € 24.6 billion loss a year earlier .

the czech republic has already qualified , but the fate of the rest of group d will be decided on wednesday . a draw could theoretically suffice for germany if the netherlands and latvia also tied , but that 's not how german playmaker michael ballack and his teammates are heading into the game .
" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .

13 , 1945 has been a potent symbol of the horrors of war .
the baroque frauenkirche , germany ’ s largest protestant church , was originally built in the heart of dresden in 1743 .
it miraculously survived two days and nights of the bombing , before succumbing to the 1,000 degree celsius heat generated by some 650,000 incendiary bombs that were dropped on the city .
the event not only leveled buildings , but also killed an estimated 135,000 people .

the building vanished from dresden 's skyline .
the ruins of the frauenkirche were a reminder of the horrors of that war , said allan russell from the dresden trust , in london .
" -lrb- the bombing of dresden -rrb- was an act of war designed to bring the war to the end , but it was a brutal act , " he told dw-radio .
in 1989 , a handful of residents in dresden formulated plans to rebuild the frauenkirche .
one early obstacle was a lack of funding , so in 1991 , the residents formed a society in support of rebuilding the cathedral and collected donations from around the world .
faithful reconstruction another issue was how to rebuild the church .
should it be altered in some way to represent the time that had passed between its construction and its downfall and the historical changes of that time span ?

reconstruction finally began in january 1993 .
now nearly completed , the frauenkirche can become a symbol of hope and peace , dresden trust 's russell said .
" we need to make a gesture back , to express our sorrow about the deaths and destruction and our determination to build things with our german friends for the future , " he said .
rebuilding the frauenkirche cost some € 130 million -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which was privately donated .
of the millions of stones used in the rebuilding , nearly 8,000 original stones were salvaged and set back in their place .
modern technology a computer imaging program which could move the stones three-dimensionally around the screen in various configurations was used to help architects find where the original stones sat and how they fit together .
the work will not end with setting of the church ’ s cupola and gilded cross on tuesday .

13 , 1945 has been a potent symbol of the horrors of war .
the baroque frauenkirche , germany ’ s largest protestant church , was originally built in the heart of dresden in 1743 .
it miraculously survived two days and nights of the bombing , before succumbing to the 1,000 degree celsius heat generated by some 650,000 incendiary bombs that were dropped on the city .
the event not only leveled buildings , but also killed an estimated 135,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carpenters prepare to work on the frauenkirche 's sandstone dome the eight interior sandstone pillars supporting the colossal dome exploded ; the outer walls shattered and nearly 6,000 tons of stone plunged to earth , penetrating the massive floor as it fell .
the building vanished from dresden 's skyline .
the ruins of the frauenkirche were a reminder of the horrors of that war , said allan russell from the dresden trust , in london .
" -lrb- the bombing of dresden -rrb- was an act of war designed to bring the war to the end , but it was a brutal act , " he told dw-radio .
in 1989 , a handful of residents in dresden formulated plans to rebuild the frauenkirche .
one early obstacle was a lack of funding , so in 1991 , the residents formed a society in support of rebuilding the cathedral and collected donations from around the world .
faithful reconstruction another issue was how to rebuild the church .
should it be altered in some way to represent the time that had passed between its construction and its downfall and the historical changes of that time span ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearing completion in 2004 in the end , the society finally decided to restore the frauenkirche to its original form .
reconstruction finally began in january 1993 .
now nearly completed , the frauenkirche can become a symbol of hope and peace , dresden trust 's russell said .
" we need to make a gesture back , to express our sorrow about the deaths and destruction and our determination to build things with our german friends for the future , " he said .
rebuilding the frauenkirche cost some € 130 million -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which was privately donated .
of the millions of stones used in the rebuilding , nearly 8,000 original stones were salvaged and set back in their place .
modern technology a computer imaging program which could move the stones three-dimensionally around the screen in various configurations was used to help architects find where the original stones sat and how they fit together .
the work will not end with setting of the church ’ s cupola and gilded cross on tuesday .
part of the frauenkirche ’ s dome and the interior of the cathedral still has to be completed .

that gave him a clear win over the council 's current secretary general , conservative austrian politician walter schwimmer , who received 91 votes , and the liberal estonian candidate , kristiina ojuland , with 51 votes . davis has been a member of the council 's parliamentary assembly for 12 years , and president of the socialist group in the assembly since 2002 .
davis said it was a " great honor " to be elected secretary general . " i have a vision of europe as part of a world where men and women are treated fairly and equally - a europe where people live in peace on the basis of mutual respect without any discrimination based on gender , sexual orientation , ethnic origin or religious belief , " davis said .
" the council of europe is the best way to turn that vision into a reality . " defender of human rights the council of europe , situated in strasbourg , france , is the continent 's oldest political organization .
it was founded in 1949 , and groups together 45 countries , including 21 countries from central and eastern europe . the council was set up to defend human rights and parliamentary democracy .
membership binds nations to uphold the european convention on human rights , which provides individual europeans the option to appeal human rights rulings in their own countries to the european court of human rights , also located in strasbourg . since 1989 , the council of europe 's main task has been to act as a human rights watchdog for europe 's post-communist democracies and to assist those countries in bringing about political , legal and constitutional reforms . cultural issues to take precedence speaking at a press conference after his election , davis said that in addition to human rights issues , he intends to focus on cultural issues during his five-year term , which begins on sept .
1 . " the council of europe should concentrate on culture , because european culture is far more than just the culture of the european union , " davis said .
" this area has not been given enough significance in the past . " when asked to explain what he saw as the difference between the council of europe and the european union , davis said that while the eu looks after the standard of living , the council of europe looks after quality of life . " of course there 'll be times when we overlap , but we should take care to avoid this because it wastes time , money and effort , " davis said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : turkey takes another stride towards the eu the council of europe has given turkey a positive report card regarding its democratic reforms .

toll collect , the german consortium responsible for developing and operating the system , said on tuesday that the most crucial parts of the satellite-based scheme worked with 99.6 percent precision .
over the past six months the consortium tested so-called on board units in 41 trucks that traveled more than 130,000 kilometers -lrb- 80,778 miles -rrb- on german highways . christoph bellmer , toll collects ’ s chief executive officer , claims the controversial technology is now working smoothly after technical problems held up the project for more than a year . " we were also able to prove that not only the on-board units functioned without problems but also the entire infrastructure behind them .
the system is now able to collect all the data and calculate exactly how much toll must be paid , " bellmer told dw-radio . bellmer replaced his hapless predecessor , hans-burghardt ziermann , at the helm of toll collect in march , after the government threatened to cancel the € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.5 billion -rrb- contract in the wake of a series of technical failures .
in a last-minute deal with chancellor gerhard schröder , the owners of toll collect - among them telecommunications giant deutsche telekom and automaker daimlerchrysler - agreed to pay millions in compensation in exchange for a new chance and a pledge to take german engineering giant siemens on board at the consortium . now the truck toll system is set to become fully operational by january 1 , 2005 - exactly two years after original plans for its introduction . " one can not say it is working without a hitch , " hans-dieter otto , the owner of a german haulage company which took part in the recent test phase , said .
" there are still some places along highways where trucks are not automatically registered .
but they were only a few and toll collect is certainly able to fix that in time . " experts criticize test experts contend , however , that the testing involving only 41 trucks was little proof of the system 's reliability and that a second phase with around 4,000 trucks planned for this autumn will be the ultimate test .
the ambitious german toll system uses gps satellites to track the distance trucks travel on toll roads .
mobile phone equipment will then transmit billing data for processing . from 2005 , trucks on german autobahns are to be charged at least 12 cents per kilometer depending on their size and exhaust volume .
german haulage companies have long struggled against the introduction of a highway toll and view its introduction with skepticism . " this system is still very much cobbled together , " adolf zobel , head of the german association of haulage companies , said .
" if it really works will be uncertain until the very last day .
apart form that the system , of course , means an added financial burden for us . “ over the past year and a half , however , trucks using german autobahns have not been charged , since the government prematurely scrapped its old vignette system in the hope the new truck toll would be up and running by early 2003 .

germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

it 's do or die on wednesday night , as germany must realistically defeat the czech republic to advance to the quarter-finals .
with the czechs already through , a german win would eliminate holland and latvia . despite only managing two draws in germany 's first two matches , coach rudi völler and his team remain confident of their chances to make it to the next round of euro 2004 .
the czech republic has already qualified , but the fate of the rest of group d will be decided on wednesday . a draw could theoretically suffice for germany if the netherlands and latvia also tied , but that 's not how german playmaker michael ballack and his teammates are heading into the game .
" it 's all or nothing , but that 's what we 've been expecting all along , " ballack said on tuesday . the german-czech showdown is a rematch of the euro 1996 final .
back then the germans managed to beat the czechs 2-1 after oliver bierhoff scored a " golden goal " to give germany its third european championship title .

but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency . " martial law was imposed over the entire country in 1978 and was later upheld as a state of emergency , a notch below the level of martial law , in parts of the country until two years ago . new challenges to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minaret of a local mosque in gelsenkirchen , western germany , is flanked by a german , left , and turkish flag .
there 's no doubt that turkey 's entry will pose completely new political challenges to the eu .
after all turkey 's 70 million citizens are almost exclusively muslims and thus members of a different religious community than the largely christian europe . but it 's exactly this difference in religion that gives europe the chance to prove that it 's capable and prepared for dialogue and peace with other cultures and faiths .
those who want a stable peace in europe need turkey as a bridge of trust between the orient and the occident , between east and west . dealing with islamic fundamentalism and blasphemous terrorism demands courage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 23.06.2004 no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german coaching team agrees that attacking is their only option .
germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .
while the germans need victory to progress , the qualified czechs are unlikely to do germany any favors in their own quarter-final quest . germany needs a victory in lisbon on wednesday night to qualify for the quarter-finals of euro 2004 and will go all out to get one .
that 's the combative message coming from the german camp ahead of the crunch final game against the czech republic which rudi völler 's boys must win if they are to progress .
the czechs are already through and meet denmark in the knock-out phase ; germany has to dig deep to beat the in-form team in group b to grab the last quarter-final spot . " we have to win and i believe we can if we show some passion , " said völler .
the coach is plotting the czech republic 's downfall in style with playmaker michael ballack the man charged with providing the impetus that will take germany to the next round and the waiting swedes . " it is very important for us that michael can get into the box and into goal scoring positions .
he has worked hard and is now the focal point - he can cope with that .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .
germany : kahn , friedrich , woerns , nowotny , lahm , frings , hamann , scheider , schweinsteiger , ballack , kuranyi .
czech republic : blazek , mares , rozehnal , bolf , jiranek , plasil , tyce , galasek , vachousek , heinz , lokvenc .

jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .

but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency . " martial law was imposed over the entire country in 1978 and was later upheld as a state of emergency , a notch below the level of martial law , in parts of the country until two years ago . new challenges to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minaret of a local mosque in gelsenkirchen , western germany , is flanked by a german , left , and turkish flag .
there 's no doubt that turkey 's entry will pose completely new political challenges to the eu .
after all turkey 's 70 million citizens are almost exclusively muslims and thus members of a different religious community than the largely christian europe . but it 's exactly this difference in religion that gives europe the chance to prove that it 's capable and prepared for dialogue and peace with other cultures and faiths .
those who want a stable peace in europe need turkey as a bridge of trust between the orient and the occident , between east and west . dealing with islamic fundamentalism and blasphemous terrorism demands courage .
courage to look beyond one 's own christian existence and along with it to accept turkey as a country that wants to carry europe 's political values beyond its geographical borders . baha güngör -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pleasing eu means delaying terror trial in turkey a raft of reforms aimed at increasing turkey 's chances to get into the european union caused the unexpected delay of an al-qaeda terror trail - the court in which it was held was abolished .

germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .
while the germans need victory to progress , the qualified czechs are unlikely to do germany any favors in their own quarter-final quest . germany needs a victory in lisbon on wednesday night to qualify for the quarter-finals of euro 2004 and will go all out to get one .
that 's the combative message coming from the german camp ahead of the crunch final game against the czech republic which rudi völler 's boys must win if they are to progress .
the czechs are already through and meet denmark in the knock-out phase ; germany has to dig deep to beat the in-form team in group b to grab the last quarter-final spot . " we have to win and i believe we can if we show some passion , " said völler .
the coach is plotting the czech republic 's downfall in style with playmaker michael ballack the man charged with providing the impetus that will take germany to the next round and the waiting swedes . " it is very important for us that michael can get into the box and into goal scoring positions .
he has worked hard and is now the focal point - he can cope with that . " established strikers have struggled völler has come under increased pressure from the media and fans back home to come up with a strike force that can improve on the current dismal record of just one goal in the opening two games of this tournament .
kevin kuranyi , fredi bobic and miroslav klose have all been employed in germany 's attacking formation but have yet to spark either together or individually . the calls from home have centered on 19-year-old lukas podolski , the fc cologne striker who was a surprise inclusion in the squad and has yet to make an appearance . ballack charged with scoring duties it seems more likely that völler will give ballack a more advanced role in the hope that the barcelona-bound midfielder will reproduce his world cup form where he was a driving force in germany 's route to the final .
ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .
" it is unfair to criticize the attackers when the goals do not come as it concerns the entire team rather than a few individuals , " he said .
" i am sure we can solve our attacking problems . " we have to improve our supply of crosses but if we come out with self-confidence and play to our potential , we can do it again . " midfielder sees team work as solution ballack himself was not to be lured in to assuming the mantle of germany 's goal scoring solution .
" i am not putting myself under pressure , " he told the team 's daily press conference on wednesday .
" it is not important whether i get the goals or someone else does as long as someone scores . " the czech republic has had no such problems with striker milan baros hitting his stride as the tournament heats up and the supporting midfield weighing in with influential service .
but with group d already won , the czechs are expected to rest several of their star players although baros is likely to start the game . " if nedved and galasek are not there , this may not necessarily be bad for us , " rudi völler said .
" but it 's really up to us - we have to show character and willpower . " " whatever line-up they use , they will come out to play hard - everybody wants to trip germany . " czechs want three wins out of three assistant coach miroslav beránek agreed that germany are a scalp that most teams want to capture and insisted the czechs would not be letting up against the germans . " we want to finish the group with a third victory in a row , " he said .
" our substitutes are hungry to finally get a game so they can prove themselves .
but the quarter-final is the most important thing for us right now , " he added . " the guys are motivated , they feel a chance they can prove themselves .
we still want to win though ; it 's good for our self-confidence .

ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 23.06.2004 dutch threaten bar-room brawl at last chance saloon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland coach dick advocaat is under fire from all sides the dutch are staring elimination in the face before the game against latvia on wednesday .
but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .

but ankara ca n't afford to rest on its laurels . the positive report about democracy and law in turkey will end the political monitoring program carried out by the council of europe which began in 1996 as a result of escalating tensions following the military coup in turkey in 1990 . the assessment will normalize strained relations between the strasbourg institution and turkey as well as help turkey take an important step further on the long road to the eu .
but , as deutsche welle 's baha güngör says , ankara still has much work to do . seen through turkish eyes , the vote in the eu parliamentary assembly is a positive result .
but it should n't be seen as a final entry ticket to the eu club .
there 's still much disorder in the turkish state even though the light at the end of the tunnel is shining brighter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leyla zana , center right , and selim sadak , left , are greeted by supporters after they were freed from a prison in ankara on june 9 , 2004 .
the belgiun and luxembourgian members of the council of europe who reported on turkey 's progress were impressed by concrete measures turkey has taken : the kurdish human rights activist and former parliamentarian leyla zana -lrb- photo -rrb- was recently released from prison after ten-years together with three other former members of parliament of kurdish-origin . zana , who was awarded the european parliament 's human rights prize , is now openly demanding peace , a renunciation of violence and stability in turkey as well as an end to the struggle between militant kurds and the turkish state . torture still in place these positive developments should n't be allowed to mask the fact that it took a long time and much patience before the situation in turkey had " normalized . " in september last year , experts of the council of europe discovered during a visit to turkish prisons that although it was n't as frequent as earlier , torture methods were still being used against inmates , particularly in kurdish-dominated regions .
mistreatment , such as beatings , forced sleep deprivation or being made to stand for hours as well as limiting access to a lawyer , were still frequently practiced . with the end of direct monitoring , turkey now joins the group of nations that fall in the " post-monitoring " stage .
here turkey finds itself in much better company : eu countries such as the czech republic , latvia and slovakia all belong to the group as well as eu aspirants romania , bulgaria and croatia . more reforms needed turkey is well on its way to fulfilling the membership criteria of the eu in the areas of democracy , the rule of law , protection of minorities , and individual and institutional freedom .
it is also meeting eu economic criteria .
but the country still has to clear a number of hurdles before taking its place in the european union family . that includes , for instance , the lowering of the ten-percent hurdle in parliamentary elections - which above all prevents a representation of the kurds in parliament - the possibility of refusing service in the army , an amendment of penal law and a review of laws stemming from the country 's long-running " state of emergency . " martial law was imposed over the entire country in 1978 and was later upheld as a state of emergency , a notch below the level of martial law , in parts of the country until two years ago . new challenges to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the minaret of a local mosque in gelsenkirchen , western germany , is flanked by a german , left , and turkish flag .
there 's no doubt that turkey 's entry will pose completely new political challenges to the eu .
after all turkey 's 70 million citizens are almost exclusively muslims and thus members of a different religious community than the largely christian europe . but it 's exactly this difference in religion that gives europe the chance to prove that it 's capable and prepared for dialogue and peace with other cultures and faiths .
those who want a stable peace in europe need turkey as a bridge of trust between the orient and the occident , between east and west . dealing with islamic fundamentalism and blasphemous terrorism demands courage .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .

at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .

" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .

germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .
for the next two months , it 's going to adorn josef 's bedroom walls .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .
everyone is blaming the technical staff for this loss but no one talks about the defensive errors that cost us two goals . " " but i think we are over-rated .
we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that . " he said .
" you win together , you lose together and that is what happened in the last match .
everyone is responsible for what happened . " latvia takes on holland with a possible , surprising qualification still within reach .
" if i 'd said 10 days ago that now i 'd be talking about qualifying for the quarter-finals it would have seemed like a joke , " said coach aleksandrs starkovs .
the latvians will not be overawed by the dutch , he added and that , match by match , his team 's confidence is growing . " we 've shown we can play big teams , " said starkovs , whose side could qualify if they beat the dutch and the czech republic do not lose to germany .
" we have a realistic chance to reach the quarter-finals . " latvia relishing every game " it 's already a victory to still be talking about making it into the last eight before the third group game .
we can play attacking football but - as against germany - we can play defensively and still create more chances than our opponents . " " the draw against germany is without a doubt our most significant international result because it was in an international tournament and because it was against the germans , " starkovs said .
" but our job now is to be ready to give our maximum against the netherlands . " a victory comes next , warns latvian stalwart latvia defender mihails zemlinskis told the team 's press conference that latvia was on a roll with their results getting better and better as the tournament progressed .
" we 've lost one match , we drew the second , and now it 's time for a victory , " said zemlinskis .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

he insisted she marry a man from turkey . in britain last year , abdalla yones , a kurdish muslim who stabbed his 16-year-old daughter , heshu , 11 times and slit her throat after she started a relationship with a christian boyfriend , was jailed for life . " honor killings , " as the phenomenon is known , usually involve women being murdered , usually by brothers and fathers , for having sex outside marriage , dating , refusing an arranged marriage , wanting to go to university or even having been raped .
the practice is not uncommon in traditional , male-dominated arab societies . fadime 's and heshu 's cases and others like them in europe have prompted calls for urgent action to protect young immigrants who fall out with their families and for police to reinvestigate murders suspected of having been honor killings . in a further sign that the phenomenon is being considered a serious problem , european police officials met at europol headquarters in the hague on tuesday with women 's organizations , social groups and academics to look at ways of tackling the issue and to exchange information and strategies .
the aim is to set up a pan-european unit to combat the killings and crack down on related issues such as trafficking in women . lack of awareness and statistics though experts say that honor killings are on the rise in europe , the problem is hobbled by a lack of awareness , mainly because the issue remains largely hidden from public view . in 2000 , the united nations estimated that around 5,000 girls and women in at least 14 countries , among them pakistan , jordan and turkey , were killed yearly because their families felt they brought dishonor on them . but statistics in europe are hard to come by given the fact that some honor-related crimes are recorded as simple murders or domestic violence . " in several european countries , cases similar to fadime 's of murder and violence have become increasingly common or more likely , they have been common for many years but have now started to become visible , " said a report by the swedish women 's advocacy group kvinnoforum , a sponsor of tuesday 's conference . mürea böhmecke of terres des femmes in germany , an organization for the protection of women that is beginning a campaign in november to raise awareness of honor killings , told dw-world , " there are no concrete statistics available , but unofficial estimates are considered to be high .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 23.06.2004 dutch threaten bar-room brawl at last chance saloon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland coach dick advocaat is under fire from all sides the dutch are staring elimination in the face before the game against latvia on wednesday .
but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .
everyone is blaming the technical staff for this loss but no one talks about the defensive errors that cost us two goals . " " but i think we are over-rated .
we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .
germany : kahn , friedrich , woerns , nowotny , lahm , frings , hamann , scheider , schweinsteiger , ballack , kuranyi .
czech republic : blazek , mares , rozehnal , bolf , jiranek , plasil , tyce , galasek , vachousek , heinz , lokvenc .

germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .
while the germans need victory to progress , the qualified czechs are unlikely to do germany any favors in their own quarter-final quest . germany needs a victory in lisbon on wednesday night to qualify for the quarter-finals of euro 2004 and will go all out to get one .
that 's the combative message coming from the german camp ahead of the crunch final game against the czech republic which rudi völler 's boys must win if they are to progress .
the czechs are already through and meet denmark in the knock-out phase ; germany has to dig deep to beat the in-form team in group b to grab the last quarter-final spot . " we have to win and i believe we can if we show some passion , " said völler .
the coach is plotting the czech republic 's downfall in style with playmaker michael ballack the man charged with providing the impetus that will take germany to the next round and the waiting swedes . " it is very important for us that michael can get into the box and into goal scoring positions .
he has worked hard and is now the focal point - he can cope with that . " established strikers have struggled völler has come under increased pressure from the media and fans back home to come up with a strike force that can improve on the current dismal record of just one goal in the opening two games of this tournament .
kevin kuranyi , fredi bobic and miroslav klose have all been employed in germany 's attacking formation but have yet to spark either together or individually . the calls from home have centered on 19-year-old lukas podolski , the fc cologne striker who was a surprise inclusion in the squad and has yet to make an appearance . ballack charged with scoring duties it seems more likely that völler will give ballack a more advanced role in the hope that the barcelona-bound midfielder will reproduce his world cup form where he was a driving force in germany 's route to the final .
ballack has scored 19 times for germany , more than any of the recognized strikers have to their name . despite the drought , völler refused to point the blame at his misfiring strike force .
" it is unfair to criticize the attackers when the goals do not come as it concerns the entire team rather than a few individuals , " he said .

but instead of focusing on a performance to save their campaign , the fractious oranje are on the verge of an untimely implosion . the netherlands face the prospect of a very public humiliation in braga on wednesday night as the volatile dutch take on latvia - and their own inner demons - with a quarter-final place , and more importantly their reputation in the world game , at stake . with one draw and one loss in their unremarkable euro 2004 campaign so far , the dutch take on the solid latvians while stuck in a precarious position .
both teams share the same single point , just one behind germany with everything to play for .
a win for any of the three teams hoping to follow the czech republic through to the knock-out phase would be enough as long as their rivals falter .
for the dutch , such a scenario is unthinkable . holland 's fate is out of their hands , as they must rely on the czechs beating germany in the other group d match to reach a stage of the tournament that most people expected from such a talented squad of players .
however , the usual disquiet has started in the dutch camp and as it has in previous years , it threatens to derail their campaign . exterior forces dictate dutch destiny " i 'm sure our players will give everything , " said holland coach willem van hanegem , covering for under-fire dick advocaat at the news conference .
" it is annoying to depend on others but we caused this situation so you ca n't blame anyone else for it . " the coach was at the center of some vicious criticism after making several controversial substitutions in holland 's 3-2 defeat to the czech republic , a match the dutch had led 2-0 .
so much so that advocaat declined to attend monday 's pre-match news conference , sending van hanegem to take questions in his place . even the assistant coach could barely hide the fact that there had been ructions in the camp over the tactical debacle that cost holland the match on june 19 . coaching team at odds over tactics " we had some discussion among the technical staff about the changes , " said van hanegem .
" i thought there were other possibilities , but it still is advocaat 's responsibility .
everyone is blaming the technical staff for this loss but no one talks about the defensive errors that cost us two goals . " " but i think we are over-rated .
we have quality players but are simply not a team who will run over every opponent . " criticism of the coach leaked from the players after the loss to the czechs .
midfielder edgar davids , who could barely hide his annoyance at the fact that his team 's fate lay in the hands of others , suggested his coach had to accept some of the blame for holland 's precarious position but also lamented that he and his team mates had snatched defeat from the jaws of victory . players speak out after czech " we have to assess the whole team and the coach is part of that . " he said .
" you win together , you lose together and that is what happened in the last match .
everyone is responsible for what happened . " latvia takes on holland with a possible , surprising qualification still within reach .
" if i 'd said 10 days ago that now i 'd be talking about qualifying for the quarter-finals it would have seemed like a joke , " said coach aleksandrs starkovs .
the latvians will not be overawed by the dutch , he added and that , match by match , his team 's confidence is growing . " we 've shown we can play big teams , " said starkovs , whose side could qualify if they beat the dutch and the czech republic do not lose to germany .
" we have a realistic chance to reach the quarter-finals . " latvia relishing every game " it 's already a victory to still be talking about making it into the last eight before the third group game .
we can play attacking football but - as against germany - we can play defensively and still create more chances than our opponents . " " the draw against germany is without a doubt our most significant international result because it was in an international tournament and because it was against the germans , " starkovs said .
" but our job now is to be ready to give our maximum against the netherlands . " a victory comes next , warns latvian stalwart latvia defender mihails zemlinskis told the team 's press conference that latvia was on a roll with their results getting better and better as the tournament progressed .
" we 've lost one match , we drew the second , and now it 's time for a victory , " said zemlinskis .

both match reports run below . germany 1- 2 czech republic the last matches in the so-called " group of death " were all about the last quarter-final place .
the czechs had already won group d and germany were guaranteed to progress if they could beat them in lisbon . czech republic coach karel bruckner opted to rest several key players , with an eye on the quarter-final clash with denmark on june 27 .
pavel nedved , tomas rosicky , jan koller and milan baros were just four of a total of nine changes in the czech line-up . rudi völler gave bastian schweinsteiger his first start of euro 2004 but continued to stick with kevin kuranyi alone up front despite the striker 's current drought and the need for germany to go for the win . germany started the game nervously against the czech b team and were nearly punished for their over caution as early as the fourth minute when a dangerous free-kick caused confusion in the german defense and martin jiranek missed the tap-in under pressure , leaving kahn to safely gather the ball . three minutes later and it was michael ballack who was ruefully looking at a missed opportunity .
schweinsteiger showed the pace that had won him a starting place by getting to the goal line and cutting a high cross into the box .
ballack 's glancing header whipped wide when more contact would have caused blazek serious problems . the republic 's reserves quickly recovered from their early scare and settled into their stride .
jaroslav plasil showed philipp lahm a clean pair of heels and skipped past another challenge but failed to beat the third defender .
plasil was upended by nowotny and won his side a free-kick in a dangerous position .
the resultant shot was high and wide but the czechs had decalred their intentions . despite a number of half chances , there was little rhythm in the first 20 minutes with neither side willing to grab the game by the scruff of the neck . michael ballack , given the responsibility of firing the germans ' attacking options , nearly caught blazek out with a deflected shot that dipped just over the bar .
but a minute later , a smart knock-down by schweinsteiger set up a beautifully hit half-volley from ballack that rifled past the despairing keeper and high into the roof of the net from the edge of the area .
germany were in front . news of a ruud van nistlerooy penalty putting the dutch 1-0 up floated through to the stadium as marek heinz lined up a free-kick for the czechs on 27 minutes .
the resultant curling effort flew high past oliver kahn and into the roof of the net to equalize .
once more , the scenario shifted , putting germany in third place in group d. germany 's game seemed to go to pot for a few minutes after the equalizer with a wild challenge earning jens nowotny a yellow card and manic gesticulations from every german as schweinsteiger went down on the edge of the czech penalty area while kuranyi openly expressed his frustration as three defenders surrounded him without a team mate in sight .
composure was needed as germany threatened to combust . the break came just in time for germany ; time to re-group and plot a second half which would need more invention and execution . rudi völler judged that this would come better from lukas poldolski than thorsten frings as he brought on the 19-year-old who the german nation had been calling for .
but podolski 's introduction was almost overshadowed by a second czech goal with 2 minutes of the restart . huebschman delivered a brilliant cross which lokvenc steered goalwards .
his shot lacked the pace needed to beat kahn , who gratefully smothered the ball . the germans soon woke up and podolski was in the thick of things , feeding the attack .
bernd schneider almost benefited from the youngster 's vision on the edge of the box but his attempted lob was palmed over the bar by blazek . germany continued to press with ballack again getting into a strikers position to latch onto a cross in the penalty area on 55 minutes .
his header again lacked the necessary purchase and the flicked effort sailed away from its intended target . in an attempt to break the germans rhythm and to maybe grab a third victory from the group phase , the czechs brought on in-form striker milan baros on the half hour mark . the germans continued to send in high crosses which blazek gratefully received time and time again without trouble as germany searched for the second goal .
it nearly came on 65 minutes when ballack drifted inside and unleashed a vicious shot which cannoned off the post and into the path of bernd schneider .
with blazek struggling to fill the gaping goal , schneider hit the shot straight into the diving keeper 's flying fists . the germans were encamped around the czech penalty box as the killer ball eluded them .
time and time again , the pressure came to nothing but still the germans turned the screw .
lahm sent in another whizzing cross for schneider to flash a header wide when a more considered attempt on goal would surely have given germany the lead . podolski almost created headlines minutes later when he weaved into the six-yard box and whacked a close range effort at blazek .
the ensuing melee involved legs and arms flying in all directions but the ball was eventually cleared and the chance went with it . and then the game and the tournament looked to have gone too .
milan baros tore through the german defense and although kahn saved the first effort , the ball squeezed under the germany captain into the striker 's path and baros quickly switched feet and slotted home the czech republic 's second goal to break german hearts . miroslav klose came on to give germany three attackers with two goals the target in 12 minutes .
but the change looked to have come too late .
the czechs looked increasingly lively as the clock ticked on . germany 's hope were ebbing away as they looked set to join the italians and spanish as the big name casualties of the opening stages .
the final whistle confirmed the fears of a nation - germany were out .

the dutch would go through with victory against latvia but only if the germans did not beat the czechs .
latvia would take the final qualification spot only with a victory over the dutch and a czech win or draw . the latvians were unchanged from the team which drew with germany but under-fire dutch coach dick advocaat brought in veteran defender frank de boer for the injured wilfred bouma and michael reiziger to replace the suspended johnny heitinga . holland were immediately on attack from the first whistle .
clarence seedorf shot over from outside the box after just 28 secondsand three minutes later a snap-shot from van der meyde was blocked by stepanovs on the edge of the latvia area . the dutch were relentless with philip cocu coming close to opening the scoring on 11 minutes with a fierce shot from long range .
latvian keeper kolinko was equal to it and got down well to turn the ball around his left-hand post . holland were in complete control of the opening stages , but latvia 's defence continued to hold firm .
van nistelrooy tried an ambitious shot from 20 yards out on 20 minutes , but the ball drifted wide of latvia 's right-hand post .
at the same time in lisbon , michael ballack was putting germany 1-0 up and edging both holland and latvia out of the quarter-final spot . the permetations changed again three minutes later when van nistlerooy converted a penalty in the 27th minute .
davids burst into the latvian box and went to ground under the challenge of astafjevs . van nistelrooy stroked the spot-kick into the bottom right corner of the goal as kolinko dived the wrong way , converting the highly contentious penalty .
minutes later the czech republic equalized in lisbon and put holland in second place . holland gripped harder on that quarter-final chance eight minutes later when van nistlerooy scored his second goal of the game .
seedorf 's long free-kick from wide on the left was neatly headed back across goal by cocu at the far post and van nistelrooy dropped to nod in the ball from two yards out . the manchester united striker almost had a first-half hat-trick when a chipped effort had kolinko scrambling back , only to see the shot dribble the wrong side of the post after a timely interception by the defense . the latvians welcomed the break after 45 minutes of dutch pressure .
they started the second half with renewed vigor .
the dutch , well aware that a 2-0 lead means nothing until the final whistle blows , were suddently on the back foot as prohorenkovs sent in a low cross only for rubins ' shot to be saved easily by van der sar . latvia continued to press .
another rubins shot was deflected wide and from the corner lobanovs hit the post with a low drive .
the dutch were taking their time to wake up after the interval . a classic example of the slumber the dutch were caught in came seconds later .
from a wonderful free-kick , van nistlerooy found himself with the goal at his mercy , only to loft the ball high and wide when it was easier to score . kolinko was then forced into another smart one-handed save , again from van nistelrooy .
straight away the dutch went on the attack with van der meyde trying his luck - but kolinko was up to the task again . the chances kept coming for the dutch but kolinko was having the game of his life .
first overmars and then robben were denied before the latvian keeper smothered yet another close range effort from van nistlerooy . it was the striker 's last action of the game .
roy makaay replaced van nistlerooy in a strange substitution by dick advocaat , denying the attacker what looked increasingly like a hat-trick waiting to happen . with the czech republic taking the lead in lisbon , van nistlerooy 's efforts looked to have been enough to secure the dutch that last quarter-final spot .
and with his replacement finishing the job , holland were on their way . another impressive run from robben ended with a crisp pass to makaay on the edge of the area and the bayern munich striker beat his marker with one touch before finishing with a fine shot . from potential disaster to paradise , the dutch dream lives on and the oranje now progress to do battle with the swedes on june 26 .
for latvia , it was a brave tournament but the final game showed a chasm in class that could not be bridged over the group stage games . holland : van der sar , reiziger , de boer , stam , van bronckhorst , seedorf , davids , cocu , van der meyde , van nistelrooy , robben latvia : kolinko , isakovs , stepanovs , zemlinskis , blagonadezdins , bleidelis , lobanovs , astafjevs , rubins , prohorenkovs , verpakovskis referee : kim milton nielsen -lrb- denmark -rrb- nick amies back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : no favors for germany as czechs look for another scalp germany face group d winners the czech republic on wednesday in a must-win game .

13 , 1945 has been a potent symbol of the horrors of war .
the baroque frauenkirche , germany ’ s largest protestant church , was originally built in the heart of dresden in 1743 .
it miraculously survived two days and nights of the bombing , before succumbing to the 1,000 degree celsius heat generated by some 650,000 incendiary bombs that were dropped on the city .
the event not only leveled buildings , but also killed an estimated 135,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carpenters prepare to work on the frauenkirche 's sandstone dome the eight interior sandstone pillars supporting the colossal dome exploded ; the outer walls shattered and nearly 6,000 tons of stone plunged to earth , penetrating the massive floor as it fell .
the building vanished from dresden 's skyline .
the ruins of the frauenkirche were a reminder of the horrors of that war , said allan russell from the dresden trust , in london .
" -lrb- the bombing of dresden -rrb- was an act of war designed to bring the war to the end , but it was a brutal act , " he told dw-radio .
in 1989 , a handful of residents in dresden formulated plans to rebuild the frauenkirche .
one early obstacle was a lack of funding , so in 1991 , the residents formed a society in support of rebuilding the cathedral and collected donations from around the world .
faithful reconstruction another issue was how to rebuild the church .
should it be altered in some way to represent the time that had passed between its construction and its downfall and the historical changes of that time span ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearing completion in 2004 in the end , the society finally decided to restore the frauenkirche to its original form .
reconstruction finally began in january 1993 .
now nearly completed , the frauenkirche can become a symbol of hope and peace , dresden trust 's russell said .
" we need to make a gesture back , to express our sorrow about the deaths and destruction and our determination to build things with our german friends for the future , " he said .
rebuilding the frauenkirche cost some € 130 million -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which was privately donated .
of the millions of stones used in the rebuilding , nearly 8,000 original stones were salvaged and set back in their place .
modern technology a computer imaging program which could move the stones three-dimensionally around the screen in various configurations was used to help architects find where the original stones sat and how they fit together .
the work will not end with setting of the church ’ s cupola and gilded cross on tuesday .
part of the frauenkirche ’ s dome and the interior of the cathedral still has to be completed .
work is likely to be finished in 2006 , in time for the city ’ s 800th anniversary . anita purcell -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : silicon saxony : chip factory brings high-tech to dresden u.s. chipmaker amd has broken ground on a $ 2.4 billion factory in dresden that will manufacture silicon wafers .

germans looking to redecorate their apartments rarely think of a service many cities offer : for next to no money , people can borrow art work from the municipal collections . should i take the watercolor ?
or the black-and-white portrait ?
or the bronze sculpture ?
at a rental fee of a few euros per month to cover insurance , someone sifting through their local artotheque might decide to take all three of them . while german cities are struggling to fund cultural institutions as the economic downturn has emptied their coffers , renting out art is a cheap way for them to offer culture to their residents .
about 120 artotheques currently exist in germany and more are likely to follow . the cities of ludwigsburg and osnabrück are thinking of setting up art-rental programs .
" in hanover , officials are already going through the municipal collection to select works they can lend , " said johannes stahl , who heads the german artotheque association and runs such a lending place for the former german capital , bonn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room in bonn 's artotheque residents of bremen , for example , can choose between works by german artists max ernst , joseph beus and gerhard richter or even take home a günter grass drawing to go along with one of the nobel laureate 's novels .
photography buffs can find pieces by man ray or helmut newton and there are even works by rene magritte and roy lichtenstein on offer . will it fit the wallpaper ? the reasons why people pick paintings are often pragmatic : is the artist famous ?
will it go with my wallpaper ?
will it fit into my car ?
" anything that does n't fit into a golf gets discarded , " stahl said , adding that he and his colleagues also have pretty straight-forward criteria when selecting works for the program . " it 's good when they 're framed under glass , " he said .
" that way they do n't wear down so quickly .
after all , it 's mostly laymen who take home works of art from here . " to be on the safe side , artotheques do insure their pieces and a fee for that is included in the rental price : bonn charges € 7 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per painting for two months .
while the art works usually return home safely , one customer recently forgot his painting on the train and another got caught in the rain , stahl said . looking for something mystical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large , colorful paintings are the most popular ones educating renters about the pieces they choose is part of the package .
stahl hands them leaflets with information about the artist and his work .
he said he 's hoping to get people to choose art not just because it 's " pretty " and matches the living room carpet .
" naturally there 's more demand for large , colorful paintings than small black-and-white ones , " he said . rental habits change over time , according to stahl : " those who come more frequently do n't just look for the obvious : they 're choosing paintings that mystify them . " but that was n't the case for 7-year-old josef , who recently stopped by bonn 's artotheque with his mother to pick a painting for his room .
" that one 's silly and that one 's totally boring , " he said , pointing to a couple of pieces before settling on a screenprint depicting dark-green raindrops with faces in front of a dying forest .
" i want that one , " he screamed .
" that one 's funny ! " his mother did n't seem to get it .
" well , it 's a bit serious , " she said , looking slightly unhappy before telling stahl to wrap it up .
for the next two months , it 's going to adorn josef 's bedroom walls .

gaye knight was working in a shop in tunbridge wells when richard jarvis had a diabetic fit and stopped breathing .
he had no pulse and had effectively died but miss knight resuscitated him and gave him heart massage which paramedics said kept mr jarvis alive .
she said she remembered the techniques from a casualty episode about diabetes .
even though she had only seen things on tv soaps , she really saved his life paramedic tony kemp miss knight said she has spent hours glued to casualty - the story of a fictional hospital 's accident and emergency department .
she was reunited with the man she helped save - now getting back to health - at the photographic store where he collapsed .
he said : " i realised i was in trouble , the last thing i can remember was standing here thinking i needed help , leaning against the wall and then turning into the shop saying ' help me ' .
" that was all i remember until i came round in a and e. "
waiting for paramedics to arrive , miss knight thought back to what she had seen on casualty and stepped into action .
casualty tells the tale of hospital staff in the fictional city of holby she said : " unfortunately he had gone into a diabetic fit and soon afterwards it was obvious that he had gone into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing .
" i felt for a pulse and there was no pulse so i started doing resuscitation on his chest and giving him heart massage . "
paramedic tony kemp arrived within minutes and took over but paid tribute to miss knight and her actions .
he said : " i was there within four or five minutes so the chances were fairly good that we could have restarted his heart .
" but those four to five minutes still take away some chance of survival .
" the fact that gaye just got on and did it , even though she had only seen things on tv soaps , she really saved his life . "
miss knight is now set to receive an award from the royal humane society for her actions .
she said : " a lot of people laugh at these programmes , and i think i 've actually sat there and thought ' this is unbelievable , does this really happen ? ' .
" but obviously it does happen . "

oxfordshire county council has launched the ' sitting tight ' road safety campaign as part this year 's national child safety week .
the aim is to educate and train parents and carers in the proper use of children 's car seats .
in particular , they are appealing to fathers to come forward and receive advice on how to have them fitted .
peter cleary , fire risk manager with oxfordshire fire and rescue , said : " we are hoping that fathers and grandfathers , as well as mothers and grandmothers , will come along and let us check their children 's car seats .

the aim is to educate and train parents and carers in the proper use of children 's car seats .
in particular , they are appealing to fathers to come forward and receive advice on how to have them fitted .
peter cleary , fire risk manager with oxfordshire fire and rescue , said : " we are hoping that fathers and grandfathers , as well as mothers and grandmothers , will come along and let us check their children 's car seats .
" our observations from previous campaigns have shown that some fathers are reluctant to receive our advice .
" this is possibly because they assume that they have fitted the seat securely and safely .
" unfortunately , this is often not the case and it 's not because of their lack of ability . "
professionals from the fire and rescue service will be on hand offering advice and checking the fitting of children 's car seats on saturday , 26 june , in the car park next to the citizens ' advice bureau in thame .

the figures are revealed in a report by the charity macmillan cancer relief .
it says thousands of patients do not get what they are entitled to thanks to lack of information , confusion , or embarrassment .
the charity 's findings relate to unclaimed benefits of disability living allowance and attendance allowance .
people diagnosed with terminal cancer automatically qualify for these benefits .
across the uk as a whole , more than one million people living with the illness may still be entitled to claim a number of different allowances .
the charity says some people may not be aware they are entitled to claim , while others may find it difficult or embarrassing to apply .
cathy lindley , general manager for macmillan cancer relief in wales hopes that more cancer sufferers will be encouraged to find out whether they could be entitled to benefits .
she says the payments could , at least , ease some of the stress caused by money problems when patients and their families are already under considerable strain .
just last week , experts warned that wales would have over 5,000 extra cancer cases in 2024 because of its growing number of over 65s .
wales already has the uk 's highest cancer rate - largely because of its sizeable elderly population .
smoking research new figures released at a cardiff conference warned cancer rates would rise as the number of retired people grew .
the welsh assembly is taking action , including setting up a committee to look at smoking in public .
in wales , 17 % of the population is over 65 .
according to the welsh cancer intelligence and surveillance unit , that figure will grow to 23 % by 2024 .
wales currently has 527 cancer cases for every 100,000 people - compared with 373 for every 100,000 in london .
dr john steward , director of the unit , said : " wales ' relatively elderly population is already heavily burdened by cancer and the latest projections suggest the incidence of the disease will continue to rise .
" it 's extremely important that we continue to monitor and analyse the latest trends in population and cancer incidence , as they will be invaluable as the basis for future planning of cancer services " .

here 's what our reporter sarah campbell found when she visited cottenham , a place experiencing conflict between residents and travellers : in march this year , the people of this cambridgeshire village refused to pay their council tax .
it was the only way they felt the authorities would take their concerns over a neighbouring travellers camp seriously .
there had been a travellers camp just outside the village of cottenham for 40 years .
then early last year that land was bought by irish travellers who bought more land and only retrospectively applied for planning permission .
the possibility of hundreds more travellers on their doorstep led local people to set up a nationwide campaign group demanding action .
the situation at cottenham is not unique .
the number of what are called unauthorised developments where the land is privately owned but permission to live on it has n't been granted ... is nearing 2000 .
legislative changes in the early 90 's took away the statutory duty on local councils to provide gypsy and traveller sites .
instead they are supposed to identify suitable areas and work with the communities to purchase and develop them .
in practice , this just has n't happened .
in the majority of cases , where land is bought by an individual and planning permission sought ... it will be turned down .
local authorities believe they are being made to shoulder responsibility for what should be a national issue .
all those involved await the results of a central government review into the issue , as well as the widescale changes to planning policies due to be published at the end of the year .

we talked to the chairman of the gypsy council charles smith and susie kemp from the local government association .
click here to watch charles smith and susie kemp charles smith said : there is a shortfall of sites .
local councils need to identify traveller gypsy sites , at the moment there are n't any .
susie kemp said : kemp : you ca n't camp first and apply for permission later we support call for more sites as communities we need to work together .
there is some evidence that sites are being provided but they 're not being used .
retrospective planning permission is seen by residents as a difficult thing .
gypsies should n't be camping first and then applying for permission .
and we heard from the housing minister yvette cooper .
we need to provide more sites , we ca n't do it quickly however .

here 's what our reporter sarah campbell found when she visited cottenham , a place experiencing conflict between residents and travellers : in march this year , the people of this cambridgeshire village refused to pay their council tax .
it was the only way they felt the authorities would take their concerns over a neighbouring travellers camp seriously .
there had been a travellers camp just outside the village of cottenham for 40 years .
then early last year that land was bought by irish travellers who bought more land and only retrospectively applied for planning permission .
the possibility of hundreds more travellers on their doorstep led local people to set up a nationwide campaign group demanding action .
the situation at cottenham is not unique .
the number of what are called unauthorised developments where the land is privately owned but permission to live on it has n't been granted ... is nearing 2000 .
legislative changes in the early 90 's took away the statutory duty on local councils to provide gypsy and traveller sites .
instead they are supposed to identify suitable areas and work with the communities to purchase and develop them .
in practice , this just has n't happened .
in the majority of cases , where land is bought by an individual and planning permission sought ... it will be turned down .
local authorities believe they are being made to shoulder responsibility for what should be a national issue .
all those involved await the results of a central government review into the issue , as well as the widescale changes to planning policies due to be published at the end of the year .
in evidence to the select committee inquiry the government predicts thousands more pitches will be needed .
but where they will be is a question very far from being answered .

the value of japan 's exports exceeded that of its imports by 934 billion yen -lrb- $ 8.6bn -rrb- in may , a 35 % increase on the year , the finance ministry said .
japan 's trade surplus has now risen for 11 months running , helped by a recovering world economy .
the latest increase reflects strong demand for cars and digital cameras .
the figures for may confirmed the importance of other asian countries to japan 's export-oriented economy .
the value of japan 's exports to the rest of asia rose by 17.5 % on the year to 2.3 trillion yen , or 49 % of total export revenues .
china watching exports to europe also grew , rising 5.6 % to 729 billion yen .
exports to the us , meanwhile , fell 7 % on the year to just over 1 trillion yen .
the decline in the value of us-bound exports reflected a growing trend for japanese companies to export to the us via their subsidiaries in china .
analysts said the export boom would continue for the next few months , buoyed by sustained demand from china and other fast-growing asian economies .
however , they warned that credit-tightening measures introduced by the chinese government in an effort to prevent the economy from overheating could hinder japan 's export performance towards the end of the year .
" considering imports are not likely to drop as much as exports , japan 's trade surplus will shrink , " said tomomichi akuta , an economist at ufj institute .
japan emerged from a ten-year period of stagnation in late 2003 as a weak yen combined with china 's economic boom and a recovery in the us to generate a surge in export sales .
there is evidence that the export boom is now spilling over into the wider japanese economy , holding out the prospect of a sustained rebound .

birmingham hodge hill 's terry davis has been elected secretary general of the council of europe .
he held the seat with a labour majority of 11,618 over the tories at the 2001 general election .
the prime minister was already facing a key electoral test in a safe labour seat following the death of leicester south 's jim marshall in may .
earlier this month labour suffered badly in european and local elections with their share of the vote falling to its lowest level since before world war one .
in leicester south , labour has selected an anti-war candidate , sir peter soulsby amid fears they face a tough challenge from lib dems who are hoping to exploit anger over policy in iraq among the area 's asian population .
the council of europe is a body distinct from the eu , made up of 45 european states .

on wednesday the prince of wales will become the first royal visitor to set foot on the island , population 55 .
the occasion is to mark 800 years since the channel islands pledged their allegiance to the crown , rather than their nearer neighbours in france .
at herm school , which has two girls and seven boys aged four to nine , pupils are taking the visit in their stride .
teacher in charge janet sandrey said : " it 's a close-run thing at the moment between the royal visit and the latest hatching of some chickens in their list of priorities . "
the children attend the school until the age of nine when they go to a weekly boarding school in guernsey .
" we 're just hoping the weather holds out , " said mrs sandrey , who comes in by boat every day from guernsey .
" the forecast is horrendous and the boat may not be able to get into the harbour . "
a decision is due to be taken later on wednesday on whether it is safe for the prince to land at rosaire steps at the harbour . "
we were very surprised when we heard prince charles was coming here " manager adrian heyworth adrian heyworth , who manages the island with wife pennie , said : " the prince is very interested in seeing around the island because it is very similar to the scilly isles which is part of the duchy of cornwall .
" i believe he is interested to learn how this island is managed . "
the prince is due to arrive at rosaire steps to meet all 55 island residents under the flagpole on the lawn of the white house hotel , the island 's only one .
the 500-acre island also has only one pub and one main shop .
from there he will walk up the hill to the norman church of st tugual 's , the island 's only church , where mr heyworth or his wife give sermons on a sunday .
there is no vicar .
the 75 minute visit is part of a two-day excursion around the channel islands which were part of the lands of the dukes of normandy when william the conqueror extended his domain by conquering england .
in 1204 king john lost normandy , but the islanders , many of whom had landed interests in england , decided to align themselves with the english .
and there they have remained - bar occupation by the germans during world war ii .
today they are counted as part of the british isles , but not of the uk or the eu , with their own governments and generous taxation systems .
after world war ii herm was left derelict and abandoned until the guernsey authorities bought it from the crown - the fee has never been disclosed .
herm , unlike its bigger , feudally-run neighbour sark , comes under guernsey 's jurisdiction .
peter and jenny wood were chosen as the first tenants of the island in 1949 and their daughter pennie heyworth - with husband adrian - continue the family link with the island .
mr heyworth said : " we were very surprised when we heard prince charles was coming here .
" normally we just get passed by because we do not have our own parliament and are more of a commercial undertaking . "
he added : " we are absolutely thrilled .
it 's a tremendous event for the island community .
" we are , after all , the jewel in the crown of the channel islands . "

the occasion is to mark 800 years since the channel islands pledged their allegiance to the crown , rather than their nearer neighbours in france .
at herm school , which has two girls and seven boys aged four to nine , pupils are taking the visit in their stride .
teacher in charge janet sandrey said : " it 's a close-run thing at the moment between the royal visit and the latest hatching of some chickens in their list of priorities . "
the island is one of the smallest channel islands the children attend the school until the age of nine when they go to a weekly boarding school in guernsey .
" we 're just hoping the weather holds out , " said mrs sandrey , who comes in by boat every day from guernsey .
" the forecast is horrendous and the boat may not be able to get into the harbour . "
a decision is due to be taken later on wednesday on whether it is safe for the prince to land at rosaire steps at the harbour .
we were very surprised when we heard prince charles was coming here manager adrian heyworth adrian heyworth , who manages the island with wife pennie , said : " the prince is very interested in seeing around the island because it is very similar to the scilly isles which is part of the duchy of cornwall .
" i believe he is interested to learn how this island is managed . "
the prince is due to arrive at rosaire steps to meet all 55 island residents under the flagpole on the lawn of the white house hotel , the island 's only one .
the 500-acre island also has only one pub and one main shop .
from there he will walk up the hill to the norman church of st tugual 's , the island 's only church , where mr heyworth or his wife give sermons on a sunday .
there is no vicar .
the 75 minute visit is part of a two-day excursion around the channel islands which were part of the lands of the dukes of normandy when william the conqueror extended his domain by conquering england .
no cars are allowed on the island in 1204 king john lost normandy , but the islanders , many of whom had landed interests in england , decided to align themselves with the english .
and there they have remained - bar occupation by the germans during world war ii .
today they are counted as part of the british isles , but not of the uk or the eu , with their own governments and generous taxation systems .
after world war ii herm was left derelict and abandoned until the guernsey authorities bought it from the crown - the fee has never been disclosed .
herm , unlike its bigger , feudally-run neighbour sark , comes under guernsey 's jurisdiction .
peter and jenny wood were chosen as the first tenants of the island in 1949 and their daughter pennie heyworth - with husband adrian - continue the family link with the island .
mr heyworth said : " we were very surprised when we heard prince charles was coming here .
" normally we just get passed by because we do not have our own parliament and are more of a commercial undertaking . "
he added : " we are absolutely thrilled .
it 's a tremendous event for the island community .
" we are , after all , the jewel in the crown of the channel islands . "

pauline purdey , from bargoed , south wales , says she is virtually housebound and is in severe pain .
she said that she was told in 1995 that she had arthritis and needed a new hip - but because she was in her forties , she was too young .
the welsh assembly government has said that orthopaedic services in wales are improving , and an independent expert has said that mrs purdey 's difficulties are partly because replacement hips have a limited lifespan and she was relatively young .
mrs purdey has investigated a private operation , but said it would have been out of the question , costing around £ 12,500 .
so she says she is still taking anti- inflammatory drugs , and is forced to sleep on the sofa because she is too unstable to get up the stairs .
" i do feel extremely hard done by in some ways , " she said .
" my big problem is falling - i have fallen before and ended up in hospital , so i tend not to go up the stairs . "
mrs purdey said she had to give up her job as an area sales adviser four years ago because she could not drive .
she has been under the care of the royal gwent hospital in newport since 2001 .
she was put on a waiting list in september 2003 , and doctors say they hope she will get an operation by september 2004 .
plaid cymru health spokesman rhodri glyn thomas has raised pauline 's case in the welsh assembly .
he says her situation is an unacceptable example of the problems which remain in the welsh nhs .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said : " there is a great amount of work currently underway to improve orthopaedic services across wales . "
she added that waiting times will be further reduced for patients in mrs purdey 's area , with major developments planned for st woolos hospital in newport .
marcus longley , associate director of the welsh institute for health and social care , said the case highlights the problems hospitals are having with orthopaedics .
" to some extent this is a special case , because one of the factors in this issue is her age , " he said .
" you are reluctant to do the operation too early because the hips only have a certain lifespan . "
however , he did say the situation was improving in wales .
" it looks like the figures have turned the corner and are getting better , but we are still substantially behind england . "
fred johnson , from arthritis research - a charity which supports people with arthritis and lobbies to find a cure for the illness - described mrs purdey 's case as " saddening " .
he says he hopes that the work by the welsh assembly government to develop an all-wales arthritis strategy could help people like mrs purdey in the future .
the strategy - which would be the first of its kind in wales - would take a co-ordinated approach to arthritis and look at things like priority waiting times .

pauline purdey , from bargoed , south wales , says she is virtually housebound and is in severe pain .
she said that she was told in 1995 that she had arthritis and needed a new hip - but because she was in her forties , she was too young .
the welsh assembly government has said that orthopaedic services in wales are improving , and an independent expert has said that mrs purdey 's difficulties are partly because replacement hips have a limited lifespan and she was relatively young .
mrs purdey has investigated a private operation , but said it would have been out of the question , costing around £ 12,500 .
so she says she is still taking anti- inflammatory drugs , and is forced to sleep on the sofa because she is too unstable to get up the stairs .
" i do feel extremely hard done by in some ways , " she said .
" my big problem is falling - i have fallen before and ended up in hospital , so i tend not to go up the stairs . "
mrs purdey said she had to give up her job as an area sales adviser four years ago because she could not drive .
she has been under the care of the royal gwent hospital in newport since 2001 .
she was put on a waiting list in september 2003 , and doctors say they hope she will get an operation by september 2004 .
plaid cymru health spokesman rhodri glyn thomas has raised pauline 's case in the welsh assembly .
he says her situation is an unacceptable example of the problems which remain in the welsh nhs .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said : " there is a great amount of work currently underway to improve orthopaedic services across wales . "
she added that waiting times will be further reduced for patients in mrs purdey 's area , with major developments planned for st woolos hospital in newport .
50,000 hip replacements take place every year in the uk marcus longley , associate director of the welsh institute for health and social care , said the case highlights the problems hospitals are having with orthopaedics .
