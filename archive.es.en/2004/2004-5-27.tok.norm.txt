gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .
latin america can only succeed in improving its trade with europe when its own economy begins improving . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu heads to mexico for multilateral talks heads of government from the new enlarged european union are gearing up to meet representatives of 33 latin american nations in the third summit of its kind since 1999 .

eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .

so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .

he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .
neighboring countries had also been put on alert , as well as police officials in eu countries which are part of the schengen agreement , which abolished border checks for certain eu states . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court approves deportation of " caliph of cologne " a german court wednesday ruled metin kaplan , the leader of an islamic fundamentalist group , could be deported to his native turkey .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .

earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .
neighboring countries had also been put on alert , as well as police officials in eu countries which are part of the schengen agreement , which abolished border checks for certain eu states . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court approves deportation of " caliph of cologne " a german court wednesday ruled metin kaplan , the leader of an islamic fundamentalist group , could be deported to his native turkey .

a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress .

he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .
latin america can only succeed in improving its trade with europe when its own economy begins improving . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu heads to mexico for multilateral talks heads of government from the new enlarged european union are gearing up to meet representatives of 33 latin american nations in the third summit of its kind since 1999 .

verdi , which represents 160,000 postal workers , is asking for a four percent pay hike during the current round of wage negotiations .
jürgen blohm , a spokesman for deutsche post , called the demand " unrealistic . "
but verdi spokesperson cornelia hass told reporters that the union had examined the company 's balance sheet and that it is " confident it made the right decision " in asking for the 4 percent increase .
temporary work stoppages by 2,200 employees since saturday have caused delays for about 7.2 million mail items . dw-world.de postbank sticks with ipo , rules out sale to deutsche bank deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2004 a multicultural home for the elderly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future german nursing home residents ?
forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2004 a multicultural home for the elderly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future german nursing home residents ?
forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .
feta cheese and atatürk ninety year old perihan arcak , whose room is full of photographs of kemal atatürk , often requests feta cheese , olives and pita bread — and so someone is sent to a turkish supermarket .
and when the russian resident wants to speak with a russian doctor , this is also arranged .

however it seems british prime minister blair , in the face of support from france and germany , is struggling to fight a campaign that is gathering momentum .
according to sources quoted in the independent , verhofstadt may now get london ’ s backing on an economic reform ticket .
" we may have slightly under-estimated verhofstadt , " said the source .
" we are very keen to pursue the jobs agenda and want the new commission to move on it .
he has good credentials to do that . "
britain had given its support to the danish premier anders fogh rasmussen .
however , calls for his appointment have not been well supported with just three weeks to go until the summit that is to decide who will get the post .
meanwhile , verhofstadt 's candidature has been rejected by the president of the conservative european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- in the european parliament , german hans-gert pöttering .

might not france , or holland , be a better choice ? " you 're of course not entirely wrong , " a spokeswoman told dw-world .
" but i do n't think that would be very popular among our german customers . " so far , more than 50,000 customers have sent mastercard their guess-stimations .
and mastercard expects many more before the euro 2004 kicks off in portugal on june 12 , 2004 .
the company is one of many in germany and the rest of europe tapping into football fever in the weeks leading up to the 16-team , three-week long tournament .
riding football coattails to profit whether it 's pizza restaurants offering the right pie to go with each game , or a department store offering football-related deals , european companies are jumping at the opportunity to link themselves to the beautiful game .

the customer puts away a minimum of € 2,500 -lrb- $ 3,050 -rrb- with a basic interest rate of 1.3 percent .
if the team wins the tournament , the bank will increase the interest rate by 150 percent , to 3.25 percent .
if the team comes in second , the rate will be increased 75 percent , and so on .
" it 's a logical step in our partnership with german football association , " says a postbank spokeswoman .
" we always want to try and think of something creative and new . " partnering up with the german team has been a smart way for many companies to gain and hold access to a important consumer group .
kaufhof department stores are offering everything from germany flags , to team teddy bears in a special em ' fan shop . "
the customers , says a spokesman , have come to expect such offers from kaufhof , and " it supports our customer base . " at a time when germans are tightening their purse strings , retailers hope linking themselves to the national football team , runners up in the 2002 world cup , will spread optimism among consumers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2004 a multicultural home for the elderly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future german nursing home residents ?
forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .

forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .

more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .

the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .
feta cheese and atatürk ninety year old perihan arcak , whose room is full of photographs of kemal atatürk , often requests feta cheese , olives and pita bread — and so someone is sent to a turkish supermarket .
and when the russian resident wants to speak with a russian doctor , this is also arranged .
krause sees to these everyday wishes because of his therapeutic prescription : each individual resident with their special needs must be taken seriously and their needs responded to in an open and flexible manner .
if this approach were to become accepted in other homes , says krause , then they would be better able to respond to the needs of immigrants . silke ballweg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge read dw-world 's dossier about the growing integration challenge in germany and the rest of europe . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

might not france , or holland , be a better choice ? " you 're of course not entirely wrong , " a spokeswoman told dw-world .
" but i do n't think that would be very popular among our german customers . " so far , more than 50,000 customers have sent mastercard their guess-stimations .
and mastercard expects many more before the euro 2004 kicks off in portugal on june 12 , 2004 .
the company is one of many in germany and the rest of europe tapping into football fever in the weeks leading up to the 16-team , three-week long tournament .
riding football coattails to profit whether it 's pizza restaurants offering the right pie to go with each game , or a department store offering football-related deals , european companies are jumping at the opportunity to link themselves to the beautiful game .

germany 's postbank , which is mulling an ipo on the german stock exchange , has offered clients a cd where the interest rates are directly tied to the german national team 's success .
the customer puts away a minimum of € 2,500 -lrb- $ 3,050 -rrb- with a basic interest rate of 1.3 percent .
if the team wins the tournament , the bank will increase the interest rate by 150 percent , to 3.25 percent .
if the team comes in second , the rate will be increased 75 percent , and so on .
" it 's a logical step in our partnership with german football association , " says a postbank spokeswoman .
" we always want to try and think of something creative and new . " partnering up with the german team has been a smart way for many companies to gain and hold access to a important consumer group .
kaufhof department stores are offering everything from germany flags , to team teddy bears in a special em ' fan shop . "
the customers , says a spokesman , have come to expect such offers from kaufhof , and " it supports our customer base . " at a time when germans are tightening their purse strings , retailers hope linking themselves to the national football team , runners up in the 2002 world cup , will spread optimism among consumers .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .

might not france , or holland , be a better choice ? " you 're of course not entirely wrong , " a spokeswoman told dw-world .
" but i do n't think that would be very popular among our german customers . " so far , more than 50,000 customers have sent mastercard their guess-stimations .
and mastercard expects many more before the euro 2004 kicks off in portugal on june 12 , 2004 .
the company is one of many in germany and the rest of europe tapping into football fever in the weeks leading up to the 16-team , three-week long tournament .
riding football coattails to profit whether it 's pizza restaurants offering the right pie to go with each game , or a department store offering football-related deals , european companies are jumping at the opportunity to link themselves to the beautiful game .

germany 's postbank , which is mulling an ipo on the german stock exchange , has offered clients a cd where the interest rates are directly tied to the german national team 's success .
the customer puts away a minimum of € 2,500 -lrb- $ 3,050 -rrb- with a basic interest rate of 1.3 percent .
if the team wins the tournament , the bank will increase the interest rate by 150 percent , to 3.25 percent .
if the team comes in second , the rate will be increased 75 percent , and so on .
" it 's a logical step in our partnership with german football association , " says a postbank spokeswoman .
" we always want to try and think of something creative and new . " partnering up with the german team has been a smart way for many companies to gain and hold access to a important consumer group .
kaufhof department stores are offering everything from germany flags , to team teddy bears in a special em ' fan shop . "
the customers , says a spokesman , have come to expect such offers from kaufhof , and " it supports our customer base . " at a time when germans are tightening their purse strings , retailers hope linking themselves to the national football team , runners up in the 2002 world cup , will spread optimism among consumers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2004 a multicultural home for the elderly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future german nursing home residents ?
forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .
feta cheese and atatürk ninety year old perihan arcak , whose room is full of photographs of kemal atatürk , often requests feta cheese , olives and pita bread — and so someone is sent to a turkish supermarket .
and when the russian resident wants to speak with a russian doctor , this is also arranged .
krause sees to these everyday wishes because of his therapeutic prescription : each individual resident with their special needs must be taken seriously and their needs responded to in an open and flexible manner .
if this approach were to become accepted in other homes , says krause , then they would be better able to respond to the needs of immigrants . silke ballweg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge read dw-world 's dossier about the growing integration challenge in germany and the rest of europe .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .

the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .

forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .

the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .

so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .

he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .

their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .
feta cheese and atatürk ninety year old perihan arcak , whose room is full of photographs of kemal atatürk , often requests feta cheese , olives and pita bread — and so someone is sent to a turkish supermarket .
and when the russian resident wants to speak with a russian doctor , this is also arranged .
krause sees to these everyday wishes because of his therapeutic prescription : each individual resident with their special needs must be taken seriously and their needs responded to in an open and flexible manner .
if this approach were to become accepted in other homes , says krause , then they would be better able to respond to the needs of immigrants . silke ballweg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge read dw-world 's dossier about the growing integration challenge in germany and the rest of europe .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2004 a multicultural home for the elderly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future german nursing home residents ?
forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .
feta cheese and atatürk ninety year old perihan arcak , whose room is full of photographs of kemal atatürk , often requests feta cheese , olives and pita bread — and so someone is sent to a turkish supermarket .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.05.2004 a multicultural home for the elderly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future german nursing home residents ?
forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .
feta cheese and atatürk ninety year old perihan arcak , whose room is full of photographs of kemal atatürk , often requests feta cheese , olives and pita bread — and so someone is sent to a turkish supermarket .
and when the russian resident wants to speak with a russian doctor , this is also arranged .
krause sees to these everyday wishes because of his therapeutic prescription : each individual resident with their special needs must be taken seriously and their needs responded to in an open and flexible manner .
if this approach were to become accepted in other homes , says krause , then they would be better able to respond to the needs of immigrants . silke ballweg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge read dw-world 's dossier about the growing integration challenge in germany and the rest of europe .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .
neighboring countries had also been put on alert , as well as police officials in eu countries which are part of the schengen agreement , which abolished border checks for certain eu states . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court approves deportation of " caliph of cologne " a german court wednesday ruled metin kaplan , the leader of an islamic fundamentalist group , could be deported to his native turkey .

a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress .

earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .
neighboring countries had also been put on alert , as well as police officials in eu countries which are part of the schengen agreement , which abolished border checks for certain eu states . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court approves deportation of " caliph of cologne " a german court wednesday ruled metin kaplan , the leader of an islamic fundamentalist group , could be deported to his native turkey .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .
latin america can only succeed in improving its trade with europe when its own economy begins improving . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu heads to mexico for multilateral talks heads of government from the new enlarged european union are gearing up to meet representatives of 33 latin american nations in the third summit of its kind since 1999 .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .
latin america can only succeed in improving its trade with europe when its own economy begins improving . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu heads to mexico for multilateral talks heads of government from the new enlarged european union are gearing up to meet representatives of 33 latin american nations in the third summit of its kind since 1999 .

forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .
in a moment they will be choosing their meals .
today on the menu are a zurich veal dish with apple sauce or chicken breasts with carrots and potatoes .
the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .
the norm is not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nursing home 's muslim prayer room the nursing home in duisburg is the only one in germany with a christian chapel and a muslim mosque .
for certain muslim holidays such as the sugar festival , several additional hodshas -lrb- teachers -rrb- come to the home .
but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .
" i have to find people who do not reject but instead are interested in other cultures .
those who are interested in discovering new things . "
and those who are eager to respond to the residents ' different preferences .
feta cheese and atatürk ninety year old perihan arcak , whose room is full of photographs of kemal atatürk , often requests feta cheese , olives and pita bread — and so someone is sent to a turkish supermarket .
and when the russian resident wants to speak with a russian doctor , this is also arranged .
krause sees to these everyday wishes because of his therapeutic prescription : each individual resident with their special needs must be taken seriously and their needs responded to in an open and flexible manner .
if this approach were to become accepted in other homes , says krause , then they would be better able to respond to the needs of immigrants . silke ballweg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's integration challenge read dw-world 's dossier about the growing integration challenge in germany and the rest of europe .

forty years ago the first " guest workers " came to germany .
this generation of immigrants has reached retirement age and one german nursing home is ready to welcome them . it is dinner time at the " haus am sandberg " nursing home in duisburg .
the residents are sitting at the table in an atrium flooded with light .

the international dish today is lamb roast with a farmer 's salad and potatoes .
bernd gergrath cooks for the home 's one hundred residents every day , and everyday there is a dish without pork prepared especially for the muslim residents at the home .
the home for seniors in duisburg is germany 's only multicultural nursing home .
eleven turks , a russian , two dutchmen and a tunisian are currently living among the native german residents of the home .
the idea began 10 years ago and was first started as a pilot project .
director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .
in recent years it has been shown that immigrants make up 10 percent of the population in germany , making the notion of a multicultural society a reality here .
immigrants also need help and support when they age .
an understanding between nations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disappearance of the classic extended family among turks is a good example of the new developments , says krause : " family structures are changing .
their children are born in germany .
they have jobs and move out very early .
so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .
for this reason , a third of the personnel at the home are from a different culture .

but otherwise , krause admits , the mosque is not often used .
he says , however , that experience has shown in recent years that a mosque is not a necessary prerequisite for a multicultural facility .
because most of the residents are sick and weak , they pray in their rooms .
this is true also for the german residents .
for a multicultural facility , it is much more important to find the right personnel , says krause .

krause sees to these everyday wishes because of his therapeutic prescription : each individual resident with their special needs must be taken seriously and their needs responded to in an open and flexible manner .

might not france , or holland , be a better choice ? " you 're of course not entirely wrong , " a spokeswoman told dw-world .
" but i do n't think that would be very popular among our german customers . " so far , more than 50,000 customers have sent mastercard their guess-stimations .
and mastercard expects many more before the euro 2004 kicks off in portugal on june 12 , 2004 .
the company is one of many in germany and the rest of europe tapping into football fever in the weeks leading up to the 16-team , three-week long tournament .
riding football coattails to profit whether it 's pizza restaurants offering the right pie to go with each game , or a department store offering football-related deals , european companies are jumping at the opportunity to link themselves to the beautiful game .

germany 's postbank , which is mulling an ipo on the german stock exchange , has offered clients a cd where the interest rates are directly tied to the german national team 's success .
the customer puts away a minimum of € 2,500 -lrb- $ 3,050 -rrb- with a basic interest rate of 1.3 percent .
if the team wins the tournament , the bank will increase the interest rate by 150 percent , to 3.25 percent .
if the team comes in second , the rate will be increased 75 percent , and so on .
" it 's a logical step in our partnership with german football association , " says a postbank spokeswoman .
" we always want to try and think of something creative and new . " partnering up with the german team has been a smart way for many companies to gain and hold access to a important consumer group .
kaufhof department stores are offering everything from germany flags , to team teddy bears in a special em ' fan shop . "
the customers , says a spokesman , have come to expect such offers from kaufhof , and " it supports our customer base . " at a time when germans are tightening their purse strings , retailers hope linking themselves to the national football team , runners up in the 2002 world cup , will spread optimism among consumers .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

using the sun ’ s energy to heat water , drive small engines or even power space stations is no longer a concept out of science fiction .
but solar powered flight ?
a german professor has made it happen . stuttgart aeronautical engineer rudolf voit-nitschmann had simply planned an experimental flight .
the hobby pilot climbed into his solar-paneled plane one day last summer , with the idea of flying around southwest germany for an hour or two to test new electronic equipment . but what started off as a routine test became a world record event . the stuttgart university professor steered his glider , the icare ii , northwards .
five hours later , he landed at jena , in the german state of thuringia .
he ’ d flown a distance of some 220 miles - much further than anyone else had previously flown a solar-powered plane . “ i was a little bit surprised after one-and-a-half hours , after two hours , that the system still worked very well , ” voit-nitschmann recalls .
“ so i decided to fly as long as possible . ” a unique aircraft - with limitations the icare ii aircraft looks more or less like a standard glider .
it weighs just 640 pounds - no more than the weight of three sizeable people .
its wingspan measures around 80 feet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar modules like the ones used on the icare ii .
but its most notable feature is a black film of solar fuel cells covering the wings .
the energy of the sun , collected in these solar cells , drives a propeller fitted into the tailfin of the plane . however , there are limitations to solar flying .
these planes only really work in good weather conditions during daylight hours - and even then , only during the warmest six or seven months of the year , when the sun shines for longer periods . despite these restrictions , voit-nitschmann , who heads a team of 35 aircraft engineers and students , sees a number of possibilities for solar flight .
“ it will be possible in the future in private transportation , for example sports flying , with one or two persons , ” he says , adding that this would result in more environmentally-friendly private flying . “ the second idea is to build commercially operated platforms flying at very high altitudes of about 50,000 feet , ” voit-nitschmann says .
these could provide telecommunications and observations on the weather and other traffic .
“ they can do nearly the same things with satellites today . ” waking new interest one of the consequences of voit-nitschmann ’ s record flight is that it has promoted new interest in solar flying .
the paris-based world air sports federation is now developing special categories for solar flying records .
voit-nitschmann ’ s record is not actually official , though , because there ’ s simply no formal category for solar flight . “ i was also involved in this discussion about defining a category , and i think in one or two years , it will be possible to have an appropriate one , ” he says .
and when that happens , voit-nitschmann will bring out his plane again .
“ of course , i will try to establish this record officially if we have the appropriate category . ” if solar-powered flying does catch on in the future as a relatively cheap , environmentally-friendly , and popular form of flying , it will be thanks to the experimental and practical flying work of pioneer aviators like voit-nitschmann and his team . geoff rodoreda send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .
neighboring countries had also been put on alert , as well as police officials in eu countries which are part of the schengen agreement , which abolished border checks for certain eu states . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court approves deportation of " caliph of cologne " a german court wednesday ruled metin kaplan , the leader of an islamic fundamentalist group , could be deported to his native turkey .

might not france , or holland , be a better choice ? " you 're of course not entirely wrong , " a spokeswoman told dw-world .
" but i do n't think that would be very popular among our german customers . " so far , more than 50,000 customers have sent mastercard their guess-stimations .
and mastercard expects many more before the euro 2004 kicks off in portugal on june 12 , 2004 .
the company is one of many in germany and the rest of europe tapping into football fever in the weeks leading up to the 16-team , three-week long tournament .
riding football coattails to profit whether it 's pizza restaurants offering the right pie to go with each game , or a department store offering football-related deals , european companies are jumping at the opportunity to link themselves to the beautiful game .

the customer puts away a minimum of € 2,500 -lrb- $ 3,050 -rrb- with a basic interest rate of 1.3 percent .
if the team wins the tournament , the bank will increase the interest rate by 150 percent , to 3.25 percent .

a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .

he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .

but a court has ruled he can appeal the extradition ruling .
a europe-wide manhunt has been called off . metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne , " who disappeared after a court on wednesday ruled the man , who is wanted in turkey on charges of high treason , could be deported . but on thursday evening , police ended their search for the 51-year old after a cologne court ruled that he can still appeal his sentence within a two-month time frame .
he can not be extradited within that time .
the arrest warrant , which had been issued for kaplan , was nullified and police abandoned the european manhunt that had been in progress . " it did n't make sense anymore , " inge schürmann , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , told the associated press . while on wednesday the higher regional court in the city of münster had ruled that deportation was possible , it left open the possibility of an appeal with the federal administrative court .
kaplan 's lawyer , ingeborg naumann , then filed an emergency application requesting an appeal and the block on the extradition .
she said earlier this week that her client has prostrate cancer and is not fit to travel . massive manhunt called off before the two-month reprieve was issued , police had launched a massive manhunt to find kaplan , who had disappeared from his apartment in the chorweiler district of cologne late wednesday after the arrest warrant was issued .
earlier that day , a court in münster had overturned a previous decision that kaplan , who was found guilty of inciting hatred in germany , was unlikely to get a fair trial in turkey , where he is wanted for allegedly plotting to destroy the tomb of turkey 's founder , mustafa kemal ataturk , and for seeking to overthrow turkey 's secular government .
he faces charges of high treason there . kaplan , who is required to report to authorities on a regular basis , was last seen by an official on monday who had stopped by the apartment of the 51-year-old to check a medical certificate .
according to steffenhagen , undercover officers had kept kaplan under surveillance from 8:15 a.m.
wednesday morning , hours before the court ruling was released . however , authorities could not confirm if kaplan was still in his apartment at that time , since he enjoys freedom of movement within the city of cologne . when the search was in progress , german officials had alerted the border police and airports to be on the lookout for kaplan .
neighboring countries had also been put on alert , as well as police officials in eu countries which are part of the schengen agreement , which abolished border checks for certain eu states . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court approves deportation of " caliph of cologne " a german court wednesday ruled metin kaplan , the leader of an islamic fundamentalist group , could be deported to his native turkey .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .
latin america can only succeed in improving its trade with europe when its own economy begins improving . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu heads to mexico for multilateral talks heads of government from the new enlarged european union are gearing up to meet representatives of 33 latin american nations in the third summit of its kind since 1999 .

director ralf krause says that today more and more of his colleagues are interested in the unique aspects of the home .

immigrants also need help and support when they age .

so many turkish families are in a situation where their children are no longer at home and can no longer help them . "
more and more immigrants are turning to homes for the elderly , where care is available around the clock .
the most important factor in krause 's home , he says , is that the employees speak the native languages of the residents - particularly because alzheimers patients , for example , often quickly forget their knowledge of german and eventually revert solely to their native language .

might not france , or holland , be a better choice ? " you 're of course not entirely wrong , " a spokeswoman told dw-world .
" but i do n't think that would be very popular among our german customers . " so far , more than 50,000 customers have sent mastercard their guess-stimations .
and mastercard expects many more before the euro 2004 kicks off in portugal on june 12 , 2004 .
the company is one of many in germany and the rest of europe tapping into football fever in the weeks leading up to the 16-team , three-week long tournament .
riding football coattails to profit whether it 's pizza restaurants offering the right pie to go with each game , or a department store offering football-related deals , european companies are jumping at the opportunity to link themselves to the beautiful game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop , do n't celebrate !
germany 's postbank , which is mulling an ipo on the german stock exchange , has offered clients a cd where the interest rates are directly tied to the german national team 's success .
the customer puts away a minimum of € 2,500 -lrb- $ 3,050 -rrb- with a basic interest rate of 1.3 percent .
if the team wins the tournament , the bank will increase the interest rate by 150 percent , to 3.25 percent .
if the team comes in second , the rate will be increased 75 percent , and so on .
" it 's a logical step in our partnership with german football association , " says a postbank spokeswoman .
" we always want to try and think of something creative and new . " partnering up with the german team has been a smart way for many companies to gain and hold access to a important consumer group .
kaufhof department stores are offering everything from germany flags , to team teddy bears in a special em ' fan shop . "
the customers , says a spokesman , have come to expect such offers from kaufhof , and " it supports our customer base . " at a time when germans are tightening their purse strings , retailers hope linking themselves to the national football team , runners up in the 2002 world cup , will spread optimism among consumers .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .
that 's the case in the electronic sector now , römer said , and in terms of raw resources such as coal , steel and agricultural products , asia is n't sleeping either .

gone are the days when coffee and sugar were the only goods south america produced for the world economy .
the continent has developed dramatically and now produces an array of exports .
but trade with the eu is lagging . when the leaders of the european union meet with their latin american colleagues in mexico on friday , politics and economic issues will get top billing .
for two days , the heads of governments and state will discuss possibilities for improving cooperation between the two regions .
chief among the goals of the third eu-latin america summit is the improvement of trade relations .
even though south american imports from europe grew somewhat last year , exports to europe continued to lag .
for germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , trade with latin american countries ranked low in the overall picture .
last year the trade volume with mexico , the biggest market in the region , totaled only € 6.5 billion , putting the country in 26th position .
of that amount , the vast majority , € 5.9 billion , was based on german exports .
the situation is not much different in the rest of europe .
focus on trade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vincente fox , president of mexico .
worried about the growing gap , south american leaders have called for a rapid improvement in the trade balance .
speaking to reporters ahead of the summit , mexican president vincente fox -lrb- photo -rrb- said there was general agreement among his colleagues on the need for multilateral approaches to trade .
with an eye to u.s. plans to forge a free trade area of the americas stretching from canada to chile , fox said it was also time to boost economic cooperation with europe .
german chancellor gerhard schröder echoed his latin american counterparts on the eve of the summit .
" the biggest economies in europe and latin america are determined to work more closely , " he said after meeting with fox on thursday .
establishing free trade zones during the summit , representatives from the 33 south american and 25 eu countries will try to find areas where progress can be made toward the establishment of a free trade area , something the european parliament would like to see implemented by 2010 .
the two regions have already begun moving closer to that goal .
last week , mercosur , which groups argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay , exchanged free-trade proposals with the eu .
five central american countries -lrb- guatemala , el salvador , panama , honduras and nicaragua -rrb- are currently seeking more trade flexibility with the europeans and are aiming for a deal on free trade in january 2005 .
the andean community -lrb- bolivia , colombia , ecuador , peru and venezuela -rrb- is also hoping to use the friday gathering to encourage eu leaders to strike a deal with their group .
more than coffee and sugar improving trade is not a one-way street , and europe too stands to benefit from an increase in exports from south america .
the region of 530 million people offers an enormous potential in terms of natural resources and industrial products , which europe relies on .
in addition to agricultural goods such as coffee , sugar , soy and beef , the continent also exports cars , electronics and chemical products .
due to the considerably lower wages in the region , several major european companies have opened production sites in latin america .
germany , for instance , has 800 firms located in mexico , and nearly all the major german automakers have set up factories in brazil .
but why are n't germany and its consumers purchasing more goods from latin america ?
according to christof römer from the cologne institute for business research , poor market conditions in south america are chiefly to blame .
in two of the most important countries in the region , brazil and argentina , the economy is still struggling to recover from serious setbacks .
" these countries must first guarantee economic stability and get a good grip on their fiscal policy , " he told deutsche welle .
" once that occurs , they can concentrate on markets elsewhere , " he said .
but before that happens , competition in asia will most likely have already secured the most lucrative contracts .

for many disabled travellers transport is often problematic mps and peers examining the government 's proposed disability discrimination bill say that a prompt and clear timetable to make all means of transport useable by people with disabilities should be announced by ministers .

" we 've long argued for provision to be made in law to prevent landlords and management committees unreasonably refusing permission for disabled people to put in adaptions , " mr massie said .
other recommendations include : public office holders - including school governors - should be covered by disability legislation examining and standard setting bodies should be covered by the new laws the government should have the power to bring volunteers within the legislation if necessary people with social and communication impairments such as autism should be covered by disability legislation the recommendation on autism has been welcomed by the national autistic society -lrb- nas -rrb- .

the committee 's proposals are now awaiting a formal response from the government - probably before parliament goes into recess for the summer .

a bill will then be introduced into parliament and campaigners will be hoping that the new measures will reach the statute books before the next election as the government has already promised .

earlier , joanne lees , 30 , told a court in darwin that she used a second e-mail account to correspond with the man .
ms lees has finished giving evidence in a hearing of the man accused of murdering her boyfriend in july 2001 .
bradley murdoch , 45 , denies shooting mr falconio in an ambush in the outback .
mr falconio 's body has never been found .
the ex-mechanic also denies abducting , assaulting and tying up ms lees , from huddersfield , west yorkshire .
the committal hearing will decide whether there is enough evidence for the case to go before a jury .
if there is , ms lees , who is on her way back to britain , will be expected to return to australia as the key prosecution witness .
credibility the defence counsel grant algie told the court in northern australia that the relationship between ms lees and a man in sydney called nick struck at the heart of her credibility as a witness .
joanne lees and peter falconio were backpacking around australia the revelation by ms lees came at the end of two days of cross examination .
sitting a few feet away from the man accused of murdering her boyfriend , she was asked by mr algie whether she had a sexual relationship with another man over a period of weeks .
" i 'm going to answer yes , although i would n't classify it as an affair or a relationship , " ms lees told the court .
mr algie also asked ms lees whether she had planned to meet up with nick in berlin , to which she replied : " i made a suggestion . "
the defence said the picture painted by the prosecution of ms lees and mr falconio enjoying a harmonious and loving relationship was not necessarily the case .
' secret e-mails ' on wednesday , ms lees was asked by the defence counsel whether , when she was in alice springs after the alleged attack , she had told a police officer she needed to delete messages from a " secret e-mail account " .
ms lees admitted she had a second account but not that it was secret .
under cross examination she also revealed that she had been paid £ 50,000 -lrb- a $ 128,000 -rrb- for an interview with uk television channel granada .
the prosecution objected to the line of questioning but mr algie said it was relevant " because motive to perpetuate this story is relevant " .
ms lees gave a detailed description to the court of the man , who she says flagged down the camper van she and mr falconio were travelling in on a deserted highway near alice springs .
he pushed me in the front and sat 20 or 30cm away ... he was tall , over six foot , hunched , kind of stooping joanne lees ms lees described hearing a shot when mr falconio left their campervan before she was grabbed by the assailant at gunpoint and forced into his truck .
" he pushed me in the front and sat 20 or 30cm away .
he was tall , over six foot , hunched , kind of stooping , " ms lees told the court .
vincent miller , the truck driver who found ms lees , was also giving evidence .
he said he almost ran miss lees over when she leapt into the road and that she was screaming , shocked and disturbed .
the body of mr falconio , of hepworth , west yorkshire , has never been found but prosecutors claim there is evidence that he was murdered .
the six-week hearing to determine whether mr murdoch will face a full trial is being held over two three-week periods - with the second due in august .

but lifelong chilli fans steve waters and jason nickels last year decided to ditch their 9-to-5 existence to devote their lives to the tangy delicacies .
they now grow about 80 varieties of chilli at their devon site .
the speciality chillies are sold across devon and on the internet to fellow chilli fiends throughout the uk .
there is certainly no 9-to-5-ing and no two days are the same jason nickels , south devon chilli farm jason , 37 , and steve , 45 , were working as computer software engineers when they decided to take the plunge and indulge their personal passion .
about 18 months ago they took a lease on a plant nursery at south milton in the south hams , planted their first crop and the south devon chilli farm was born .
buoyed by the success of their initial crop this year they have planted almost 10 times more - 1,200 square metres of polytunnel crammed with dozens of varieties .
they grow about 80 varieties of chilli from the tiny red hot portuguese piri piri to the 12-inch new mex big jim .
planting takes place in early february and things start to hot up in july when the plants begin to bear fruit with some individual plants producing up to 1,000 tiny chillies .
a hot topic : chilli facts the chilli is a native of mexico has been used for more than 9,000 years the spaniards and portuguese brought it to the rest of the world in the mid-15th century south devon chilli farm 's best sellers are poblanos and chipotles -lrb- smoked jalapenos -rrb- jason and steve are currently the business ' only official employees but come picking time the ranks will swell as their wives and others are drafted in to help .
jason said : " this is a busy time , we have to get up early to work in the polytunnels before it gets too hot .
" and it 's going to get busier . "
in addition to growing fresh chillies , the business also has a burgeoning sideline making about 1,500 jars a month of chilli jams , sauces and oils - all cooked by jason and steve .
and to feed their customers ' chilli habits through the winter the pair dry what does not sell over the summer .
they sell all their produce through a variety of outlets ; farmers ' markets and local shops as well as through their website where enquiries come from across the uk .
plans for the future remain fairly modest and they want to accommodate the demands of what jason calls the " chilli heads " who , not content with just buying chillies , also want to see the plants growing for themselves .
" that is certainly something for the future , to try to accommodate visitors to the farm , " we get lots of requests from people who want to come and actually see them growing . "
steve -lrb- left -rrb- and jason are currently working on a new hot sauce contrary to the ambitions of many fledgling businesses the pair are content to let the business grow organically .
they will continue to supply local outlets and sell over the web but are uncertain about the impact of a speedy expansion on what is essentially a cottage industry .
jason said : " expanding production would mean getting an industrial unit .
" we could lose our unique status and become a factory with a small chilli farm stuck on the side , that 's not what we want .
" it would be straying from our core business . "
the future is also about focusing on the development of new products , they are working on what jason describes as a " tabasco-style " hot sauce as well as the launch of a new chilli chocolate which went on sale last week .
so can jason explain the chilli 's special allure ?
' certainly addictive ' he said : " it 's strange really .
" it 's certainly addictive , not in a chemical sense , but once people get into chillies they just seem to want to explore further .
" it 's not always about the heat because not all chillies are hot , it 's also about the flavour . "
eighteen months into the endeavour the decision to make their hobby their livelihood is paying off with each now drawing a small salary .
and jason has no complaints about freeing himself from the office environment to enjoy a life largely spent in the great outdoors .
" i was disillusioned to a certain extent with the humdrum of 9-to-5 and now life could n't be more different .
" there is certainly no 9 -to-5-ing and no two days are the same now . "

in addition to growing fresh chillies , the business also has a burgeoning sideline making about 1,500 jars a month of chilli jams , sauces and oils - all cooked by jason and steve .
and to feed their customers ' chilli habits through the winter the pair dry what does not sell over the summer .
they sell all their produce through a variety of outlets ; farmers ' markets and local shops as well as through their website where enquiries come from across the uk .
plans for the future remain fairly modest and they want to accommodate the demands of what jason calls the " chilli heads " who , not content with just buying chillies , also want to see the plants growing for themselves .
" that is certainly something for the future , to try to accommodate visitors to the farm , " we get lots of requests from people who want to come and actually see them growing . "
contrary to the ambitions of many fledgling businesses the pair are content to let the business grow organically .
they will continue to supply local outlets and sell over the web but are uncertain about the impact of a speedy expansion on what is essentially a cottage industry .
jason said : " expanding production would mean getting an industrial unit .
" we could lose our unique status and become a factory with a small chilli farm stuck on the side , that 's not what we want .
" it would be straying from our core business . "
the future is also about focusing on the development of new products , they are working on what jason describes as a " tabasco-style " hot sauce as well as the launch of a new chilli chocolate which went on sale last week .
so can jason explain the chilli 's special allure ?
' certainly addictive ' he said : " it 's strange really .
" it 's certainly addictive , not in a chemical sense , but once people get into chillies they just seem to want to explore further .
" it 's not always about the heat because not all chillies are hot , it 's also about the flavour . "
eighteen months into the endeavour the decision to make their hobby their livelihood is paying off with each now drawing a small salary .
and jason has no complaints about freeing himself from the office environment to enjoy a life largely spent in the great outdoors .
" i was disillusioned to a certain extent with the humdrum of 9-to-5 and now life could n't be more different .
" there is certainly no 9 -to-5-ing and no two days are the same now . "

one in four britons is obese the commons health committee has called for urgent action to tackle the growing threat of obesity .
but are its recommendations enough to defuse the impending time-bomb ?
the mps who sit on the house of commons health committee have spent almost a year investigating obesity .
they have interviewed 64 witnesses , read countless statements and clocked up thousands of airmiles in their quest to find the solution to britain 's " obesity time-bomb " .
their 146-page report includes stinging criticism of the government 's record to date and 69 recommendations on what now needs to be done .
these include proposals to set up a new labelling system for food , lessons for school children on healthy eating , restrictions on food advertising and a national campaign to try to get people to exercise more .
ticking bomb but are they enough to diffuse the ticking bomb ?
to have any impact at all , the recommendations must first be accepted and implemented by the government .
so far , health secretary john reid has said only that the findings will be fed into the white paper on public health to be published later this year .
nevertheless , the report is being seen as something of a watershed in the fight against obesity .
the main recommendations traffic light system for labelling food health education campaign to highlight the risks healthy eating lessons for school-children voluntary ban on junk food ads targeting children snack vending machines to be removed from schools national walking strategy more surgery for obese people on the nhs " this inquiry has already sparked huge interest and has raised awareness of obesity in the uk to unprecedented levels , " says dr susan jebb , head of nutrition and health research at the medical research council .
" the report marks the end of the beginning and we must now work to ensure that its recommendations are translated into real actions . "
the committee is clear on what those actions should be .
but it is also clear that the war on obesity must be fought on many fronts .
the report calls , in the first instance , for a more interventionist approach from government .
for instance , the mps want a new national walking strategy to encourage people to leave their cars at home .
they also want a new law to be introduced requiring manufacturers to stick clear labels on their food showing whether they are high or low in calories .
the co-op supermarket chain already has such a system in place .
tesco has announced plans to trial a similar scheme .
" i think there is every reason to believe that clearer labelling will help , " says dr jebb .
" many people find themselves thwarted because they do not know what is in their food and it 's not just in supermarkets , it 's when they are eating out too . "
health campaign the mps also want a national health education campaign to warn people about the risks of being obese .
" education and public health campaigns do work , " says dr jebb .
" what we need is a clear education programme with simple consistent messages .
i think it will help . "
we are trying to change society 's entire approach to food dr susan jebb , medical research council the mps insist that industry also has an important role to play .
while the report stops short of calling for an outright ban on unhealthy food ads , it makes clear that industry should do more to improve eating habits .
it suggests that manufacturers may want to consider a voluntary ban on junk food ads targeted at children .
it also calls for an end to celebrity-endorsement of less healthy foods and for super-sized products to be phased out .
" what we eat is strongly driven by the products that are available and how they are marketed , " says dr jebb .
" companies have a role to play not only in the composition of these products but also how they are promoted .
" they have been in denial about this for a long time but i think they are beginning to change . "
the health committee is also adamant that schools could be doing more to tackle obesity .
it wants snack vending machines removed , more physical activity and new health eating lessons for pupils .
in addition , the mps want the nhs to step up its efforts to fight obesity .
they want special obesity clinics and more surgery for people who are obese .
" we are trying to change society 's entire approach to food , " says dr jebb .
" we are trying to turn back the clock and change habits that have developed over many years .
" it is not easy but if we can change these habits then we will have an impact . "

official figures show that the retail sector 's takings fell by 1 % on the month in april , and by 0.8 % compared with the same period last year .
the data wrong-footed forecasters , who had predicted a year-on-year decline of just 0.2 % .
the figures contradicted recent signs that strong export sales were feeding through to increased consumer demand .
sales tax effect " as a trend , most consumption-related data were fairly strong in january-march , but the numbers we 've seen lately have not been as good , " said azusa kato , economist at bnp paribas .
" perhaps consumption is not as strong as everyone has begun to think . "
a pick-up in consumer spending is seen as vital to consolidating japan 's tentative recovery , which follows a ten-year period of stagnation punctuated by outright recession .
while exports and industrial activity have picked up sharply in recent months , the latest figures suggest that consumers remain unconvinced that a sustained recovery is on the cards .
one factor holding back consumer spending in japan is deflation , where falling prices lead shoppers to defer major purchases .
recent data showed that deflationary pressures are still weighing on the economy , despite the central bank 's efforts to stimulate demand by holding interest rates effectively at zero .
some analysts speculated that april 's drop in activity at the tills could reflect new regulations forcing retailers to include a 5 % sales tax on all displayed prices .

more than 1,500 hoax calls have been made during the first four months of this year , an increase of about 200 for the same period last year .
the figures were contained in a report published on thursday .
assistant divisional fire officer john langtry said all calls had to be treated as emergencies .
" if it 's a hoax call it will be 30 minutes before that 's checked out and that 's 30 vital minutes when somebody will be without immediate help if they 're in that area , " he said .
" the resources will be tied up until that 's checked out .
we 're going to have to rely on resources coming from other stations , from other ambulance stations , other fire stations , other police stations , so the community could be the victim . "
the fire brigade is hosting a joint initiative between the emergency services and bt to raise awareness of the rising trend in hoax calls .
thursday 's event will provide an opportunity for school children from belfast , omagh and londonderry to witness the potential consequences of making a hoax call .
they will see how calls are handled in control rooms , as well as getting the chance to see a major operational exercise graphically demonstrating the dangers of making a hoax call .

it is the latest in a series of deaths in custody , but it is the first time foreign specialists have been brought in on such a case .
it could prove a watershed , providing a direct , independent assessment for the first time .
uzbekistan is an ally of the us , which keeps a military base in the country .
but there is growing awkwardness over uzbekistan 's bleak record on human rights .
if the us pathologists dispute the official version , it will raise doubts about all the other government inquiries into deaths in detention an eminent us pathologist is leading the team - michael pollanen , a visiting professor for the chief medical examiner in washington .
he has worked in cambodia and east timor , and his evidence will carry much weight .
he is to supervise the autopsy of the 36-year-old man , andrei shelkavenko , who died in a police station on the outskirts of tashkent last week .
the police say he hanged himself in his cell .
the lobby group human rights watch , which saw the body , said there were open wounds to the head and neck and severe bruising to the groin .
mr shelkavenko 's mother said she saw the police beating her son in the corridor before he died .
mr shelkavenko was arrested on suspicion of murder , not political charges , but the case has serious political resonance .
if the us pathologists dispute the official version , it will raise doubts about all the other government inquiries into deaths in detention , most famously that of a man who was allegedly immersed in boiling water .
the official report says he died after cell mates threw hot tea at him .
us ties there is a us air base in uzbekistan supporting troops in afghanistan - and us aid to the country has increased greatly in recent years .
to continue to receive aid , however , uzbekistan is supposed to show it is making progress on human rights .
the fact that it is co-operating with the visit at all will be seen as some progress , but much hinges of course on the pathology report itself .
and that may not be as clear cut as many would like .
the body is already nine days old and has been kept in a morgue with faulty refrigeration in very hot weather .
the autopsy itself takes about a day , but tissue samples may have to be sent away for analysis and the whole process may take some time .

it is the latest in a series of deaths in custody , but it is the first time foreign specialists have been brought in on such a case .
it could prove a watershed , providing a direct , independent assessment for the first time .
uzbekistan is an ally of the us , which keeps a military base in the country .
but there is growing awkwardness over uzbekistan 's bleak record on human rights . "
if the us pathologists dispute the official version , it will raise doubts about all the other government inquiries into deaths in detention " an eminent us pathologist is leading the team - michael pollanen , a visiting professor for the chief medical examiner in washington .
he has worked in cambodia and east timor , and his evidence will carry much weight .
he is to supervise the autopsy of the 36-year-old man , andrei shelkavenko , who died in a police station on the outskirts of tashkent last week .
the police say he hanged himself in his cell .
the lobby group human rights watch , which saw the body , said there were open wounds to the head and neck and severe bruising to the groin .
mr shelkavenko 's mother said she saw the police beating her son in the corridor before he died .
mr shelkavenko was arrested on suspicion of murder , not political charges , but the case has serious political resonance .
if the us pathologists dispute the official version , it will raise doubts about all the other government inquiries into deaths in detention , most famously that of a man who was allegedly immersed in boiling water .
the official report says he died after cell mates threw hot tea at him .
us ties there is a us air base in uzbekistan supporting troops in afghanistan - and us aid to the country has increased greatly in recent years .
to continue to receive aid , however , uzbekistan is supposed to show it is making progress on human rights .
the fact that it is co-operating with the visit at all will be seen as some progress , but much hinges of course on the pathology report itself .
and that may not be as clear cut as many would like .
the body is already nine days old and has been kept in a morgue with faulty refrigeration in very hot weather .
the autopsy itself takes about a day , but tissue samples may have to be sent away for analysis and the whole process may take some time .
