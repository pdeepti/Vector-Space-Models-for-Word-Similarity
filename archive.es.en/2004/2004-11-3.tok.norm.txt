if europe could vote ...
fearing a repeat of the vote-counting debacle of the 2000 presidential election , whose final result was delayed for five weeks until the supreme court finally awarded victory to bush , many of the european editorialists lamented that the election was restricted to us voters even though their own fates would be influenced by the outcome .
london-based the daily telegraph commented that many people in britain , and even more in continental europe , were rooting for senator john kerry , desperate not just for a new face in the oval office and a change of tone , but also for a fundamental shift in american policy .
but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.11.2004 european press anxious over us election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european newspapers are torn between bush and kerry newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections . dubbed the " mother of all elections , " the race for the white house between george w. bush and john f. kerry is being closely watched across europe .
newspapers in the continent 's capitals have flipped back and forth between the two candidates in predictions that alternately paint a rosy or a gloomy picture for future relations .
austria 's popular krone daily warned " the mother of all elections " was set to throw " our world either into a calmer future or into new military adventures . "
" good luck , america , " quipped berlin 's tageszeitung above an image of a slot machine .
" american voters today decide their future and that of the entire world . "
italy 's la repubblica summed up the sentiments in europe : " perhaps a national election in another country has never before been followed with so much intensity , participation and partiality .
the decision between bush and kerry can be defined as the first global election , in which 130 million voters in the usa function as a planetary parliament and elect deputies on our behalf to represent six billion men and women . "
if europe could vote ...
fearing a repeat of the vote-counting debacle of the 2000 presidential election , whose final result was delayed for five weeks until the supreme court finally awarded victory to bush , many of the european editorialists lamented that the election was restricted to us voters even though their own fates would be influenced by the outcome .
london-based the daily telegraph commented that many people in britain , and even more in continental europe , were rooting for senator john kerry , desperate not just for a new face in the oval office and a change of tone , but also for a fundamental shift in american policy .
but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "
the moscow daily vremia novostei offered its own twist : " an invisible revolution has occurred in russian foreign policy : for the first time the kremlin backs the republicans ...
our experts believe that the pragmatic republicans are preferable to russia , while the democrats keep giving us lectures on human rights . "
france 's liberation , noting that the united states had been spared a pre-election " october sunrise " terror attack akin to the madrid bombings in march , wrote that the election would surely see other surprises .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.11.2004 germany bound to russia over energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas piped in from siberia is stored in facilities like this germany is dependent on russia for some 40 percent of its natural gas , and the amount is set to grow , experts warn .
at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .

these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .

" the democratic candidate said that , though they would continue to push to have votes counted in ohio and other states , there was no way the result would change . he conceded defeat to president george w. bush in a phone call earlier in the day and said the two talked about " the desperate need for unity in our country . "
bitter opponents on the campaign trail , kerry said he was prepared to reach across partisan lines to help bush build bridges in a deeply divided america .
" i did my best to expression my vision and hopes for america , " he said .
" in an american election , there are no losers , because whether or not a candidate is successful , the next morning we all wake up as americans and that is the greatest privilege ... that can come to us on earth . "
praises supporters , young voters the senator 's voice broke several times during his speech in which he thanked his family , friends , staff and the countless supporters he met criss-crossing the united states as part of his campaign in the past two years .
" i wish i could reach out my arms and wrap up each one of you individually , " kerry said .
" i thank you from the bottom of my heart . "
singilng out the enormous support he enjoyed from young voters in this election as well as the brigades of college students who canvassed and campaigned for him , kerry urged them not to give up .
" i wish i could have brought this race home for them .
i say to them now ' do n't lose faith , " ' kerry said .
" the time will come , when your work and your ballots will change the world and its worth fighting for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edwards and kerry edwards says " battle will rage on " in a short speech before kerry 's , john edwards showed flashes of the fiery rhetoric that marked the intense race for the white house in the final months .
he urged supporters to continue the fight .
" you can be disappointed but you ca n't walk away .
this fight has just begun , " he said .
" this campaign may end today but the battle for you and hardworking americans that built this country rages on . "
earlier in the day , president bush told democratic rival john kerry that he was " very gracious " after the senator conceded defeat in their hard-fought white house race , bush 's spokesman said wednesday .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .

" and then our service men and women will come home with the honor they have earned , " bush said .
" with good allies at our side , we will fight this war on terror with every resource of our national power . " " the united states of america goes forward with confidence and faith , " he concluded .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .

president bush appears confident that the projections will be turned into actual votes and that he will be named the winner .
however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .

the terrorist attacks in new york and washington were the determining moments of president bush 's first term of office .
bush 's stance of resilience was adopted by many americans . but his subsequent global campaign against terror has not made the united states more secure .
even so , bush is perceived by many as a president of action , and his credo that the american people should be defended at any cost has prompted many undecided voters to lean his way .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .

however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .
worse still , a room full of lawyers may once again be needed to decide it . last time florida , this time ohio ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voters wait on line for the polls to open in columbus , ohio .
president bush appears confident that the projections will be turned into actual votes and that he will be named the winner .
however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .
the republicans ' control of both houses is an indication that the us has clearly moved to the right in recent years . right swing weights election in bush 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 9/11 attacks have been described as the defining moment of bush 's first term .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .

he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .
but speculation was running high as to what a re-elected president bush or a president kerry would mean for the future of transatlantic relations and ties between the us and germany in particular . social democratic interior minister otto schily said he ’ d have no problems at all with bush staying in office for another four years .
he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .
" our cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism has been very close and well coordinated .
chancellor schröder and president bush have met a couple of times after the war on iraq to get a few things straight and improve their relations .
constructive transatlantic relations will remain a pillar of our policy no matter who will be the next us president . " karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german foreign ministry , echoed schily 's tone , using the situation with iran to highlight the need for better cooperation between the united states and germany , and with the whole of europe in general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush " in iran there is clearly a need to work together , " he told reuters .
" the europeans - the british , french and germans - are seeking a peaceful solution .
but the goal is to prevent , together with the americans , iran gaining access to nuclear weapons . " voigt dismissed the idea that the us would consider taking pre-emptive action against tehran to resolve the standoff .
" let us hope and work together to ensure that the cooperative solution the europeans are working on will be successful , " he said . however , parliamentarian and green party member hans-christian ströbele was much less diplomatic in describing his feelings about the chance of bush staying in office .
if president bush can defend his slight lead then my worst dreams will come true , " he said .
" because this would mean that the majority of americans are in favor of his policy and believe that the war on iraq was justified .
for me , though , that war was an unjustified invasion of another country and an attack not mandated by the united nations .
bush ’ s re-election would be a dark day for all peace-loving people in the world . ” no high expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate senator john kerry former german christian democrat parliamentary speaker rita süssmuth , who is in the us right now in her capacity as an osce election observer , told dw-radio she doubted that bush would be the man to achieve a turnaround in iraq and in transatlantic relations . “ i don ’ t think that george w. bush - if he gets re-elected - will pursue a more moderate policy in his second term , " she said .
" he ’ ll not be able to reduce the increasing polarization in society , she says .
he ’ s known to be a man who sticks to what he announces in his programs .
so , she concludes , we will continue to see a policy right of centre and will have to wait what this means for europe and germany . ” opinion polls in germany see the majority of people here in favor of john kerry .
but foreign policy expert henrik enderlein from berlin ’ s free university warned against high expectations . “ if kerry wins , the german government should be prepared to answer questions that the democrat has said he would ask .
there are a number of demands concerning europe ’ s and germany ’ s commitment to the reconstruction process in iraq and military involvement there , he says .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .
but speculation was running high as to what a re-elected president bush or a president kerry would mean for the future of transatlantic relations and ties between the us and germany in particular . social democratic interior minister otto schily said he ’ d have no problems at all with bush staying in office for another four years .
he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .
" our cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism has been very close and well coordinated .
chancellor schröder and president bush have met a couple of times after the war on iraq to get a few things straight and improve their relations .
constructive transatlantic relations will remain a pillar of our policy no matter who will be the next us president . " karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german foreign ministry , echoed schily 's tone , using the situation with iran to highlight the need for better cooperation between the united states and germany , and with the whole of europe in general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush " in iran there is clearly a need to work together , " he told reuters .
" the europeans - the british , french and germans - are seeking a peaceful solution .
but the goal is to prevent , together with the americans , iran gaining access to nuclear weapons . " voigt dismissed the idea that the us would consider taking pre-emptive action against tehran to resolve the standoff .
" let us hope and work together to ensure that the cooperative solution the europeans are working on will be successful , " he said . however , parliamentarian and green party member hans-christian ströbele was much less diplomatic in describing his feelings about the chance of bush staying in office .
if president bush can defend his slight lead then my worst dreams will come true , " he said .
" because this would mean that the majority of americans are in favor of his policy and believe that the war on iraq was justified .
for me , though , that war was an unjustified invasion of another country and an attack not mandated by the united nations .
bush ’ s re-election would be a dark day for all peace-loving people in the world . ” no high expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential candidate senator john kerry former german christian democrat parliamentary speaker rita süssmuth , who is in the us right now in her capacity as an osce election observer , told dw-radio she doubted that bush would be the man to achieve a turnaround in iraq and in transatlantic relations . “ i don ’ t think that george w. bush - if he gets re-elected - will pursue a more moderate policy in his second term , " she said .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.11.2004 us and world wait for final election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident of victory across the us and around the world , all eyes turned to ohio wednesday to see who would be the next american president .
but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "

newspapers in the continent 's capitals have flipped back and forth between the two candidates in predictions that alternately paint a rosy or a gloomy picture for future relations .

if europe could vote ...
fearing a repeat of the vote-counting debacle of the 2000 presidential election , whose final result was delayed for five weeks until the supreme court finally awarded victory to bush , many of the european editorialists lamented that the election was restricted to us voters even though their own fates would be influenced by the outcome .
london-based the daily telegraph commented that many people in britain , and even more in continental europe , were rooting for senator john kerry , desperate not just for a new face in the oval office and a change of tone , but also for a fundamental shift in american policy .
but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "

but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "
the moscow daily vremia novostei offered its own twist : " an invisible revolution has occurred in russian foreign policy : for the first time the kremlin backs the republicans ...
our experts believe that the pragmatic republicans are preferable to russia , while the democrats keep giving us lectures on human rights . "
france 's liberation , noting that the united states had been spared a pre-election " october sunrise " terror attack akin to the madrid bombings in march , wrote that the election would surely see other surprises .
" if there is a ' november 2 ' surprise , ' it will come from the legions of new voters , most of them young , who have perhaps escaped the notice of pollsters .
or from the mobilization of voters who in previous years stayed home , " it predicted . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the presidential race from a european perspective .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .

kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .

" i want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent , " bush , flanked by his wife , daughters and vice president dick cheney .
" to make this nation strong and better i need your support and will work to earn it . " bush nevertheless called his victory by more than 2 million votes a " broad " one and praised the record voter turnout that helped him to more votes than countless presidents before him .
" america has spoken , and i 'm humbled by the trust and the confidence of my fellow citizens , " bush said . promise to continue in iraq , afghanistan on wednesday , the pivotal state of ohio was given to bush , pushing him over the necessary 270 electoral votes needed for re-election .
after polls showed john kerry was still more than 100,000 votes behind in ohio with all the precincts reporting , the kerry campaign decided to concede rather than start a legal battle . in addition to promising to heal the rift that has opened in america during his first term and the past year of a bitterly-contested election , bush promised to continue to help " the emerging democracies in iraq and afghanistan ... so that they can grow in strength and defend their freedom . " and then our service men and women will come home with the honor they have earned , " bush said .
" with good allies at our side , we will fight this war on terror with every resource of our national power . " " the united states of america goes forward with confidence and faith , " he concluded .

ebay reacted casually to the decision , saying it did n't believe the stronger consumer protections would prevent people from selling their items on its service .
a right to return goods is by no means a new concept for ebay .
it was already in place for commercial sellers who offered their goods at a fixed price - which applied to about a third of all ebay sales , the company said .
many sellers also voluntarily accepted returned goods .
but the decision about who actually qualifies as a commercial seller still remains to be decided .
" that is extremely disputed in the courts , " berlin lawyer sören siebert told dpa press service .

in what was the ninth consecutive monthly rise , the ranks of the unemployed swelled by a seasonally-adjusted 12,000 to 4.457 million people from september , according to the federal labor agency .
while analysts had been expecting worse - an adjusted rise of 15,000-20,000 people - a labor agency official said that no drastic improvement in the number of jobless would be likely next year .
indeed , in an ominous warning last month to chancellor gerhard schröder , the office said that the uncorrected jobless number could break through the symbolic five-million barrier this winter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.11.2004 germany bound to russia over energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas piped in from siberia is stored in facilities like this germany is dependent on russia for some 40 percent of its natural gas , and the amount is set to grow , experts warn .
at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.11.2004 us and world wait for final election results großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confident of victory across the us and around the world , all eyes turned to ohio wednesday to see who would be the next american president .
but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .
but speculation was running high as to what a re-elected president bush or a president kerry would mean for the future of transatlantic relations and ties between the us and germany in particular . social democratic interior minister otto schily said he ’ d have no problems at all with bush staying in office for another four years .
he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .
" our cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism has been very close and well coordinated .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .
worse still , a room full of lawyers may once again be needed to decide it . last time florida , this time ohio ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voters wait on line for the polls to open in columbus , ohio .
president bush appears confident that the projections will be turned into actual votes and that he will be named the winner .
however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .
the republicans ' control of both houses is an indication that the us has clearly moved to the right in recent years . right swing weights election in bush 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 9/11 attacks have been described as the defining moment of bush 's first term .

the terrorist attacks in new york and washington were the determining moments of president bush 's first term of office .
bush 's stance of resilience was adopted by many americans . but his subsequent global campaign against terror has not made the united states more secure .
even so , bush is perceived by many as a president of action , and his credo that the american people should be defended at any cost has prompted many undecided voters to lean his way .
even the fiasco of iraq has failed to change that . additionally , bush skillfully exploited conservative mentalities in the american hinterlands , where his drive against homosexual marriages and the liberal notion of choice in abortion issues succeeded in mobilizing religious christians , above all . deeper divisions and damaged democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and democratic presidential candidate john kerry contest the divided states of america .
so while there is no official decision , what is the result of this election ?
the result is that a deep division across the country becomes deeper .
should bush be confirmed as the re-elected president , he will have to work hard to heal the wounds . the damage may stretch further than just the united states .
in the next hours and days , global opinion on the us will develop depending on the result .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.11.2004 opinion : the divided states of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the election goes to the wire , lawyers may be called to investigate the us presidential election is still too close to call and the decision may come down to one battleground state .
sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .
worse still , a room full of lawyers may once again be needed to decide it . last time florida , this time ohio ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voters wait on line for the polls to open in columbus , ohio .
president bush appears confident that the projections will be turned into actual votes and that he will be named the winner .
however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .
the republicans ' control of both houses is an indication that the us has clearly moved to the right in recent years . right swing weights election in bush 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 9/11 attacks have been described as the defining moment of bush 's first term .
anyone looking for an explanation as to why , need only look as far as sept .
11 , 2001 .
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington were the determining moments of president bush 's first term of office .
bush 's stance of resilience was adopted by many americans . but his subsequent global campaign against terror has not made the united states more secure .
even so , bush is perceived by many as a president of action , and his credo that the american people should be defended at any cost has prompted many undecided voters to lean his way .
even the fiasco of iraq has failed to change that . additionally , bush skillfully exploited conservative mentalities in the american hinterlands , where his drive against homosexual marriages and the liberal notion of choice in abortion issues succeeded in mobilizing religious christians , above all . deeper divisions and damaged democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and democratic presidential candidate john kerry contest the divided states of america .
so while there is no official decision , what is the result of this election ?
the result is that a deep division across the country becomes deeper .
should bush be confirmed as the re-elected president , he will have to work hard to heal the wounds . the damage may stretch further than just the united states .
in the next hours and days , global opinion on the us will develop depending on the result .
regardless of who wins , however , america has shown for the second time that as a model of a modern , functioning democracy , it is not a good example . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and world wait for final election results the white house has declared president george w. bush the winner of the 2004 election , despite a refusal by the democratic camp to concede defeat .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

" i want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent , " bush , flanked by his wife , daughters and vice president dick cheney .
" to make this nation strong and better i need your support and will work to earn it . " bush nevertheless called his victory by more than 2 million votes a " broad " one and praised the record voter turnout that helped him to more votes than countless presidents before him .
" america has spoken , and i 'm humbled by the trust and the confidence of my fellow citizens , " bush said . promise to continue in iraq , afghanistan on wednesday , the pivotal state of ohio was given to bush , pushing him over the necessary 270 electoral votes needed for re-election .
after polls showed john kerry was still more than 100,000 votes behind in ohio with all the precincts reporting , the kerry campaign decided to concede rather than start a legal battle . in addition to promising to heal the rift that has opened in america during his first term and the past year of a bitterly-contested election , bush promised to continue to help " the emerging democracies in iraq and afghanistan ... so that they can grow in strength and defend their freedom . " and then our service men and women will come home with the honor they have earned , " bush said .
" with good allies at our side , we will fight this war on terror with every resource of our national power . " " the united states of america goes forward with confidence and faith , " he concluded .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.11.2004 european press anxious over us election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european newspapers are torn between bush and kerry newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections . dubbed the " mother of all elections , " the race for the white house between george w. bush and john f. kerry is being closely watched across europe .
newspapers in the continent 's capitals have flipped back and forth between the two candidates in predictions that alternately paint a rosy or a gloomy picture for future relations .
austria 's popular krone daily warned " the mother of all elections " was set to throw " our world either into a calmer future or into new military adventures . "
" good luck , america , " quipped berlin 's tageszeitung above an image of a slot machine .
" american voters today decide their future and that of the entire world . "
italy 's la repubblica summed up the sentiments in europe : " perhaps a national election in another country has never before been followed with so much intensity , participation and partiality .
the decision between bush and kerry can be defined as the first global election , in which 130 million voters in the usa function as a planetary parliament and elect deputies on our behalf to represent six billion men and women . "
if europe could vote ...
fearing a repeat of the vote-counting debacle of the 2000 presidential election , whose final result was delayed for five weeks until the supreme court finally awarded victory to bush , many of the european editorialists lamented that the election was restricted to us voters even though their own fates would be influenced by the outcome .
london-based the daily telegraph commented that many people in britain , and even more in continental europe , were rooting for senator john kerry , desperate not just for a new face in the oval office and a change of tone , but also for a fundamental shift in american policy .
but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "
the moscow daily vremia novostei offered its own twist : " an invisible revolution has occurred in russian foreign policy : for the first time the kremlin backs the republicans ...
our experts believe that the pragmatic republicans are preferable to russia , while the democrats keep giving us lectures on human rights . "
france 's liberation , noting that the united states had been spared a pre-election " october sunrise " terror attack akin to the madrid bombings in march , wrote that the election would surely see other surprises .
" if there is a ' november 2 ' surprise , ' it will come from the legions of new voters , most of them young , who have perhaps escaped the notice of pollsters .
or from the mobilization of voters who in previous years stayed home , " it predicted . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the presidential race from a european perspective .

these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .

and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .

however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.11.2004 germany bound to russia over energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas piped in from siberia is stored in facilities like this germany is dependent on russia for some 40 percent of its natural gas , and the amount is set to grow , experts warn .
at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .

he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .
" our cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism has been very close and well coordinated .
chancellor schröder and president bush have met a couple of times after the war on iraq to get a few things straight and improve their relations .

" because this would mean that the majority of americans are in favor of his policy and believe that the war on iraq was justified .

" he ’ ll not be able to reduce the increasing polarization in society , she says .
he ’ s known to be a man who sticks to what he announces in his programs .
so , she concludes , we will continue to see a policy right of centre and will have to wait what this means for europe and germany . ” opinion polls in germany see the majority of people here in favor of john kerry .
but foreign policy expert henrik enderlein from berlin ’ s free university warned against high expectations . “ if kerry wins , the german government should be prepared to answer questions that the democrat has said he would ask .
there are a number of demands concerning europe ’ s and germany ’ s commitment to the reconstruction process in iraq and military involvement there , he says .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.11.2004 european press anxious over us election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european newspapers are torn between bush and kerry newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections . dubbed the " mother of all elections , " the race for the white house between george w. bush and john f. kerry is being closely watched across europe .
newspapers in the continent 's capitals have flipped back and forth between the two candidates in predictions that alternately paint a rosy or a gloomy picture for future relations .
austria 's popular krone daily warned " the mother of all elections " was set to throw " our world either into a calmer future or into new military adventures . "
" good luck , america , " quipped berlin 's tageszeitung above an image of a slot machine .
" american voters today decide their future and that of the entire world . "
italy 's la repubblica summed up the sentiments in europe : " perhaps a national election in another country has never before been followed with so much intensity , participation and partiality .
the decision between bush and kerry can be defined as the first global election , in which 130 million voters in the usa function as a planetary parliament and elect deputies on our behalf to represent six billion men and women . "
if europe could vote ...
fearing a repeat of the vote-counting debacle of the 2000 presidential election , whose final result was delayed for five weeks until the supreme court finally awarded victory to bush , many of the european editorialists lamented that the election was restricted to us voters even though their own fates would be influenced by the outcome .
london-based the daily telegraph commented that many people in britain , and even more in continental europe , were rooting for senator john kerry , desperate not just for a new face in the oval office and a change of tone , but also for a fundamental shift in american policy .
but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "
the moscow daily vremia novostei offered its own twist : " an invisible revolution has occurred in russian foreign policy : for the first time the kremlin backs the republicans ...
our experts believe that the pragmatic republicans are preferable to russia , while the democrats keep giving us lectures on human rights . "
france 's liberation , noting that the united states had been spared a pre-election " october sunrise " terror attack akin to the madrid bombings in march , wrote that the election would surely see other surprises .
" if there is a ' november 2 ' surprise , ' it will come from the legions of new voters , most of them young , who have perhaps escaped the notice of pollsters .
or from the mobilization of voters who in previous years stayed home , " it predicted . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the presidential race from a european perspective .

for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "
the moscow daily vremia novostei offered its own twist : " an invisible revolution has occurred in russian foreign policy : for the first time the kremlin backs the republicans ...
our experts believe that the pragmatic republicans are preferable to russia , while the democrats keep giving us lectures on human rights . "
france 's liberation , noting that the united states had been spared a pre-election " october sunrise " terror attack akin to the madrid bombings in march , wrote that the election would surely see other surprises .
" if there is a ' november 2 ' surprise , ' it will come from the legions of new voters , most of them young , who have perhaps escaped the notice of pollsters .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

" and then our service men and women will come home with the honor they have earned , " bush said .
" with good allies at our side , we will fight this war on terror with every resource of our national power . " " the united states of america goes forward with confidence and faith , " he concluded .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .
worse still , a room full of lawyers may once again be needed to decide it . last time florida , this time ohio ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voters wait on line for the polls to open in columbus , ohio .
president bush appears confident that the projections will be turned into actual votes and that he will be named the winner .
however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .
the republicans ' control of both houses is an indication that the us has clearly moved to the right in recent years . right swing weights election in bush 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 9/11 attacks have been described as the defining moment of bush 's first term .
anyone looking for an explanation as to why , need only look as far as sept .
11 , 2001 .
the terrorist attacks in new york and washington were the determining moments of president bush 's first term of office .
bush 's stance of resilience was adopted by many americans . but his subsequent global campaign against terror has not made the united states more secure .
even so , bush is perceived by many as a president of action , and his credo that the american people should be defended at any cost has prompted many undecided voters to lean his way .
even the fiasco of iraq has failed to change that . additionally , bush skillfully exploited conservative mentalities in the american hinterlands , where his drive against homosexual marriages and the liberal notion of choice in abortion issues succeeded in mobilizing religious christians , above all . deeper divisions and damaged democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and democratic presidential candidate john kerry contest the divided states of america .
so while there is no official decision , what is the result of this election ?
the result is that a deep division across the country becomes deeper .
should bush be confirmed as the re-elected president , he will have to work hard to heal the wounds . the damage may stretch further than just the united states .
in the next hours and days , global opinion on the us will develop depending on the result .
regardless of who wins , however , america has shown for the second time that as a model of a modern , functioning democracy , it is not a good example . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and world wait for final election results the white house has declared president george w. bush the winner of the 2004 election , despite a refusal by the democratic camp to concede defeat .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .
worse still , a room full of lawyers may once again be needed to decide it . last time florida , this time ohio ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voters wait on line for the polls to open in columbus , ohio .
president bush appears confident that the projections will be turned into actual votes and that he will be named the winner .
however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .

the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .
but speculation was running high as to what a re-elected president bush or a president kerry would mean for the future of transatlantic relations and ties between the us and germany in particular . social democratic interior minister otto schily said he ’ d have no problems at all with bush staying in office for another four years .
he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .

" let us hope and work together to ensure that the cooperative solution the europeans are working on will be successful , " he said . however , parliamentarian and green party member hans-christian ströbele was much less diplomatic in describing his feelings about the chance of bush staying in office .
if president bush can defend his slight lead then my worst dreams will come true , " he said .
" because this would mean that the majority of americans are in favor of his policy and believe that the war on iraq was justified .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .
but speculation was running high as to what a re-elected president bush or a president kerry would mean for the future of transatlantic relations and ties between the us and germany in particular . social democratic interior minister otto schily said he ’ d have no problems at all with bush staying in office for another four years .
he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .
" our cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism has been very close and well coordinated .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

newspapers in the continent 's capitals have flipped back and forth between the two candidates in predictions that alternately paint a rosy or a gloomy picture for future relations .
austria 's popular krone daily warned " the mother of all elections " was set to throw " our world either into a calmer future or into new military adventures . "
" good luck , america , " quipped berlin 's tageszeitung above an image of a slot machine .
" american voters today decide their future and that of the entire world . "
italy 's la repubblica summed up the sentiments in europe : " perhaps a national election in another country has never before been followed with so much intensity , participation and partiality .
the decision between bush and kerry can be defined as the first global election , in which 130 million voters in the usa function as a planetary parliament and elect deputies on our behalf to represent six billion men and women . "
if europe could vote ...
fearing a repeat of the vote-counting debacle of the 2000 presidential election , whose final result was delayed for five weeks until the supreme court finally awarded victory to bush , many of the european editorialists lamented that the election was restricted to us voters even though their own fates would be influenced by the outcome .
london-based the daily telegraph commented that many people in britain , and even more in continental europe , were rooting for senator john kerry , desperate not just for a new face in the oval office and a change of tone , but also for a fundamental shift in american policy .
but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "
the moscow daily vremia novostei offered its own twist : " an invisible revolution has occurred in russian foreign policy : for the first time the kremlin backs the republicans ...
our experts believe that the pragmatic republicans are preferable to russia , while the democrats keep giving us lectures on human rights . "
france 's liberation , noting that the united states had been spared a pre-election " october sunrise " terror attack akin to the madrid bombings in march , wrote that the election would surely see other surprises .
" if there is a ' november 2 ' surprise , ' it will come from the legions of new voters , most of them young , who have perhaps escaped the notice of pollsters .
or from the mobilization of voters who in previous years stayed home , " it predicted . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world has been following the presidential race from a european perspective .

kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

newspapers in the continent 's capitals have flipped back and forth between the two candidates in predictions that alternately paint a rosy or a gloomy picture for future relations .
austria 's popular krone daily warned " the mother of all elections " was set to throw " our world either into a calmer future or into new military adventures . "
" good luck , america , " quipped berlin 's tageszeitung above an image of a slot machine .
" american voters today decide their future and that of the entire world . "
italy 's la repubblica summed up the sentiments in europe : " perhaps a national election in another country has never before been followed with so much intensity , participation and partiality .
the decision between bush and kerry can be defined as the first global election , in which 130 million voters in the usa function as a planetary parliament and elect deputies on our behalf to represent six billion men and women . "
if europe could vote ...
fearing a repeat of the vote-counting debacle of the 2000 presidential election , whose final result was delayed for five weeks until the supreme court finally awarded victory to bush , many of the european editorialists lamented that the election was restricted to us voters even though their own fates would be influenced by the outcome .
london-based the daily telegraph commented that many people in britain , and even more in continental europe , were rooting for senator john kerry , desperate not just for a new face in the oval office and a change of tone , but also for a fundamental shift in american policy .
but , if kerry wins , it may not be long before america ’ s critics are once again bemoaning the heavy-handedness of the world ’ s superpower .
the bild tabloid in germany predicted how european leaders would vote if they could .
backing the " cowboy " -lrb- bush -rrb- would be italian and british prime ministers silvio berlusconi and tony blair along with russian president vladimir putin , libyan leader moamer kadhafi and al qaeda leader osama bin laden , it said .
even german chancellor gerhard schröder would cast a ballot for bush , the paper suggested , arguing that the incumbent indirectly helped the anti-war chancellor get re-elected in 2002 and " that could work again in 2006 . "
for the " gentleman " as kerry is frequently being dubbed , the paper listed blair 's wife cherie , pope john paul ii , french president jacques chirac , palestinian leader yasser arafat and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" the latter is counting on the indulgence of kerry , who was against the war , " bild said .
the flemish-language belgian business magazine de tijd said bin laden 's video address to us voters last week was aimed at boosting bush 's chances .
" with bush in the white house , al qaeda does n't need a propaganda department .
the american army is taking care of its recruitment . "
the moscow daily vremia novostei offered its own twist : " an invisible revolution has occurred in russian foreign policy : for the first time the kremlin backs the republicans ...
our experts believe that the pragmatic republicans are preferable to russia , while the democrats keep giving us lectures on human rights . "
france 's liberation , noting that the united states had been spared a pre-election " october sunrise " terror attack akin to the madrid bombings in march , wrote that the election would surely see other surprises .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .

i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

but an official final vote from the battleground state wo n't be known until mid-november . the winner of the us presidential race was still uncertain a day after the polls closed .
in the midwestern state of ohio votes were too close to call .
however , polling stations and at least two television networks put incumbent president george w. bush ahead of democratic challenger john kerry by 130,650 votes .
everyone else is holding their breath and waiting to see the outcome .
kerry has refused to concede the state , which due to its 20 electoral college votes is pivotal for deciding who will be in the white house for the next four years .
excluding ohio , iowa and new mexico , which have also not reported definitive votes , both candidates fall short of the 270 votes needed to win the race .
projections early wednesday gave bush 28 states with 254 electoral votes , and kerry 18 states and the federal capital , washington , dc , for 242 a repeat of florida 2000 ?
in shades reminiscent of the counting debacle four years ago , state and election officials in ohio announced that final results might not come for two weeks , pending a count of more than 135,000 provisional ballots and an unknown number of absentee ballots .
" what i 've told everybody is to take a deep breath and relax , " ohio secretary of state j. kenneth blackwell said at a briefing .
blackwell , a republican , said it would be impossible to say who won ohio if the difference between bush and kerry in the raw total vote was smaller than the number of outstanding provisional votes .
the provisional ballots will not be counted until the team of election officials can first determine which ones are legitimate .
under ohio law , that process can begin 11 days after ballots were cast .
" we know how to get the job done and have a very transparent process where people can see how those votes are being handled in a bipartisan way , " blackwell said in a statement intended to relieve worries that ohio could turn into another florida - a reference to the long delays and disputes over counting votes during the 2000 presidential election .
lawyers and party strategists have already descended on ohio 's capitol building in columbus for potential legal battles and demonstrators took to the streets in the city to protest against what they called voter disenfranchisement .
kerry refuses to concede meanwhile , both candidates claimed the state for themselves .
" the vote count in ohio has not been completed , " kerry campaign manager mary beth cahill said in a statement early wednesday .
" we believe when -lrb- it has -rrb- , john kerry will win ohio . "
vice presidential running-mate john edwards vowed to fight until the very last vote had been counted .
but a top campaign manager in the bush camp said kerry was " delusional " for not conceding defeat .
" the kerry campaign is delusional about their chances of overturning the vote of the people of ohio , " bush campaign communications director nicolle devenish told afp news agency .
speaking to a gathering of bush supporters in washington , white house chief of staff andy card rejected claims that there was uncertainty over the election outcome .
bush has won a decisive re-election victory , he said .
in ohio , card said that bush had a lead of at least 140,000 votes - a margin he described as " statistically insurmountable . "
card added that although bush was convinced he had won both the popular vote and the electoral college , he had decided to hold off on a formal acceptance speech in order to give kerry " time to reflect " on the results . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the race for the white house dw-world 's election dossier from a european perspective .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .
but speculation was running high as to what a re-elected president bush or a president kerry would mean for the future of transatlantic relations and ties between the us and germany in particular . social democratic interior minister otto schily said he ’ d have no problems at all with bush staying in office for another four years .
he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .
" our cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism has been very close and well coordinated .

" let us hope and work together to ensure that the cooperative solution the europeans are working on will be successful , " he said . however , parliamentarian and green party member hans-christian ströbele was much less diplomatic in describing his feelings about the chance of bush staying in office .
if president bush can defend his slight lead then my worst dreams will come true , " he said .
" because this would mean that the majority of americans are in favor of his policy and believe that the war on iraq was justified .

no one knows for sure yet but experts in berlin have already started to consider the implications of both scenarios for germany . with the outcome of the presidential election in the united states still open , german politicians were hesitant to comment on any of the two main rivals and the social democratic-green party governing coalition in berlin had n't made any official statements on the election .
but speculation was running high as to what a re-elected president bush or a president kerry would mean for the future of transatlantic relations and ties between the us and germany in particular . social democratic interior minister otto schily said he ’ d have no problems at all with bush staying in office for another four years .
he acknowledged that german-us relations were strained over the war on iraq , but added that it makes no sense any longer to concentrate on differences and discrepancies . " as far as i am concerned , i ’ ve very good relations with members of the bush administration , " he said .
" our cooperation particularly in the fight against terrorism has been very close and well coordinated .
chancellor schröder and president bush have met a couple of times after the war on iraq to get a few things straight and improve their relations .
constructive transatlantic relations will remain a pillar of our policy no matter who will be the next us president . " karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american relations in the german foreign ministry , echoed schily 's tone , using the situation with iran to highlight the need for better cooperation between the united states and germany , and with the whole of europe in general . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush " in iran there is clearly a need to work together , " he told reuters .
" the europeans - the british , french and germans - are seeking a peaceful solution .
but the goal is to prevent , together with the americans , iran gaining access to nuclear weapons . " voigt dismissed the idea that the us would consider taking pre-emptive action against tehran to resolve the standoff .
" let us hope and work together to ensure that the cooperative solution the europeans are working on will be successful , " he said . however , parliamentarian and green party member hans-christian ströbele was much less diplomatic in describing his feelings about the chance of bush staying in office .
if president bush can defend his slight lead then my worst dreams will come true , " he said .
" because this would mean that the majority of americans are in favor of his policy and believe that the war on iraq was justified .
for me , though , that war was an unjustified invasion of another country and an attack not mandated by the united nations .

" he ’ ll not be able to reduce the increasing polarization in society , she says .
he ’ s known to be a man who sticks to what he announces in his programs .
so , she concludes , we will continue to see a policy right of centre and will have to wait what this means for europe and germany . ” opinion polls in germany see the majority of people here in favor of john kerry .
but foreign policy expert henrik enderlein from berlin ’ s free university warned against high expectations . “ if kerry wins , the german government should be prepared to answer questions that the democrat has said he would ask .
there are a number of demands concerning europe ’ s and germany ’ s commitment to the reconstruction process in iraq and military involvement there , he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.11.2004 germany bound to russia over energy policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas piped in from siberia is stored in facilities like this germany is dependent on russia for some 40 percent of its natural gas , and the amount is set to grow , experts warn .
at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

at the same time , promising energy resources in central asia are being neglected . basf subsidiary wintershall will soon begin drilling in siberia , together with with the world 's largest natural gas producer , russia 's gazprom .
it 's the first time a foreign company will directly take part in boring for natural gas in russia .
the drilling will begin in 2005 near urengoy , in western siberia .
the region , some 2,500 kilometers -lrb- 1,550 miles -rrb- northeast of moscow , contains the world 's largest natural gas fields .
for moscow the decision to allow a foreign company direct access to the natural gas source is an exception to the rule .
instead of opening up its energy sector , the russian leadership is focusing more on a " creeping re-nationalization , " according to klaus umbach of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap . -rrb-
the latest sign of this " disquieting trend " was made more clear during the yukos affair .
yukos oil company got slapped with a lawsuit and a huge bill for back taxes when company founder mikhail khodorkovsky made signs of standing up to the government .
russian infrastructure ailing according to friedemann müller , energy expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , german-russian cooperation is above all a result of desperation in the russian energy sector .
" foreign investment is desperately needed , " müller told dw-world .
according to experts , russia needs more than $ 600 billion -lrb- € 472 billion -rrb- in investments in order to whip its energy sector into shape .
ramshackle pipeline networks need to be revamped and brought up to date , outdated delivery systems need to be replaced .
costs are not being spared - in the end , the future of european energy provision is at stake .
in the middle-term , russian natural gas is needed , while coal and oil are becoming less and less important .
chancellor gerhard schröder has personally accelerated cooperation with russia on energy policy .
already , 40 percent of germany 's natural gas needs are met by russia .
while the european union may for the time being produce around two-thirds of its necessary natural gas - above all in the uk and the netherlands , some 60 percent of the remainder is imported from russia .
" the increasing dependence on russia is dangerous , " cautioned swp expert müller .
and he is not alone in his warnings .
already in november 2000 , the european commission warned that the eu needed to move " toward a european strategy of energy security " according to müller , however , " the argument was simply ignored by the individual eu states . "
considering other sources but there are cogent arguments in favor of such a strategy .
in a political crisis , russia could exploit its leading role in the european energy market and disturb its pipeline workings as a means of exerting pressure , umbach from the dgap said .
moscow already sees its energy policies as an important instrument of its foreign and security policy .
in addition , in order to reach its growth goals , russia needs to set very high oil and gas prices in the coming years .
this will above all affect consumers .
and energy expert müller sees another problem : europe is the biggest import market for natural gas , and its needs are increasing quickly .
" russia does n't have the capacity to meet europe 's long term needs , " he said .
given that , some say it is disconcerting that europe is becoming yet more dependent on russian gas .
by 2020 the natural gas deposits in the north sea are expected to be all but depleted .
on the other hand , germany 's decision to shut down all its nuclear power plants by 2020 means there will be a huge need for other sources of energy .
currently , nuclear energy provides a third of the country 's entire electricity .
looking to central asia " renewable resources can not compensate for that , not by a long shot , " müller said .
like umbach , he calls for the region to " diversify " its import structure .
russia is important , no question , he said .
but diversifying sources for natural gas from different regions , such as north africa and iran , could undermine the russian monopoly on natural gas provision for europe .
this would also create more competition , which could drive down prices .
according to umbach and müller , the future lies in central asia and the southern caucasus .
turkmenistan , azerbaijan , kazakhstan and uzbekistan all have important natural gas reserves the region is closer to europe , and prospecting there would be cheaper , said müller .
plans for an affordable pipeline to europe are already in the works .
" but europe and the german government have n't made any moves " toward making it a reality , müller criticized .
he points to the strong influence of the big energy providers .
ruhrgas , one of the most important energy providers in germany and a former monopoly , is closely tied to energy giant gazprom .
but another reason for the lack of european action in developing other energy sources is the tight partnership between the german government and russian president putin , a man no one wants to risk rubbing the wrong way . steffen leidel -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to eu-wary norway trade ties , especially oil and gas interests , and oslo 's ambivalent relationship with the eu are expected to top talks when chancellor schröder meets norwegian pm bondevik in norway tuesday .

sounds familiar ?
with teams of lawyers waiting in the wings , is election 2004 going the same way as 2000 ? many hours after the polling booths were closed , the united states still does not have an equivocal winner in its presidential election .
once again , it has become a neck-and-neck race which is expected to go to the wire .
while predictions change by the hour , one thing is almost certain : this election points to a sharp spilt through the middle of the united states . america is a deeply divided country with an antiquated electoral system that is unworthy of a modern democracy .
these are the reasons why election night 2004 looks like history repeating itself . just like in 2000 , as the world waited for six weeks for the judges of the supreme court to name the winner , the name of the next us president , the most powerful politician in the world , is yet to be declared .
worse still , a room full of lawyers may once again be needed to decide it . last time florida , this time ohio ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early voters wait on line for the polls to open in columbus , ohio .
president bush appears confident that the projections will be turned into actual votes and that he will be named the winner .
however , as in the previous election , nothing is certain and everything hangs on the result in one battleground state .
last time it was florida , this time it appears to be ohio .
and once more , it looks like teams of lawyers representing both sides will flock to a contentious state and challenge the results . with the election so closely poised , every effort must be made to ensure the votes are counted within the boundaries of the law .
however , it seems unlikely that even an extended period of investigation or a recount will hand victory to john kerry . if ohio is too close to call , the decision would be put before the us congress , where the republicans have the majority ; a similar situation to that in the senate .
the republicans ' control of both houses is an indication that the us has clearly moved to the right in recent years . right swing weights election in bush 's favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 9/11 attacks have been described as the defining moment of bush 's first term .

the terrorist attacks in new york and washington were the determining moments of president bush 's first term of office .
bush 's stance of resilience was adopted by many americans . but his subsequent global campaign against terror has not made the united states more secure .
even so , bush is perceived by many as a president of action , and his credo that the american people should be defended at any cost has prompted many undecided voters to lean his way .
even the fiasco of iraq has failed to change that . additionally , bush skillfully exploited conservative mentalities in the american hinterlands , where his drive against homosexual marriages and the liberal notion of choice in abortion issues succeeded in mobilizing religious christians , above all . deeper divisions and damaged democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush and democratic presidential candidate john kerry contest the divided states of america .
so while there is no official decision , what is the result of this election ?
the result is that a deep division across the country becomes deeper .
should bush be confirmed as the re-elected president , he will have to work hard to heal the wounds . the damage may stretch further than just the united states .
in the next hours and days , global opinion on the us will develop depending on the result .
regardless of who wins , however , america has shown for the second time that as a model of a modern , functioning democracy , it is not a good example . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us and world wait for final election results the white house has declared president george w. bush the winner of the 2004 election , despite a refusal by the democratic camp to concede defeat .

i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i would just like to say as a young american , i am definitely opposed to bush 's decisions concerning world policies .
he has time and time again gone against what most americans hope for the future of this country and the countries that rely upon us .
he has created a dichotomy within our nation that is cause for alarm .
i have a hard time sleeping at night knowing that he is in power , and that my vote today for j. kerry went without notice .
i just hope that the people of the world can look beyond the governing body of america at present and realize that a large number of americans want what the world wants : a future of peace , understanding and a commitment to the further prosperity of the world as a whole . - autumn baker bush has been a disaster for our international relations ; he does not have the political experience that a lifelong political career has given kerry ; he does not exhibit the desire or need to use diplomatic means to build international -lrb- or indeed , domestic -rrb- consensus or form coalitions .
and he does not admit mistakes .
re-election would surely , in his mind , give him the " mandate " to practice more of the same unilateral , unsettlingly authoritarian governing policies both at home and abroad . - louise cantwell , usa i am of the opinion that the american election will be crucial for the world .
it is clear that if america re-elects the bush administration he will have an important endorsement of his current foreign policy .
in political terms this fact might endanger the current situation , specifically in the middle east .
it is also clear that the " old europe " is not a current friend of the bush administration .
our world needs new politicians .
i hope that american can understand this necessity . - carlos adrián ferretti , republic of argentina us-german relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the best way to improve us-german relations is to replace chancellor gerhard schröder with a pragmatic leader .
after all it 's his fault we will be turning our backs on your country and that your economy is so bad compared to the us and great britain .
next , send in troops to assist us in the conversion of iraq to a democratic country .
and last , apologize for letting down your staunchest ally . - j. chao , usa you ask which candidate would be best for improving relations with europe , my answer is neither . as your article said , the foreign policy would not change , nor would the arrogance in washington improve . because kerry speaks foreign languages does not make him a better president . bush and kerry are nothing but front men for the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings . - helen schneider , california , usa kerry would have been better for europe and the planet .
bush and associates have gotten greedy .
their total disregard for life on the planet will foment and encourage increasing resistance from peoples affected by bush 's policies to change the economic climate of the planet through aggression , misinformation and fear .
what happened to diplomacy in the neighborhood ?
our war toys have become too dangerous to continue this way .
bosnia , afghanistan and iraq are heavily contaminated by us " depleted uranium " munitions dust , in the soil , water and air .
but , what happens if this greed brings nuclear back into play ?
it 's time for a change before we create our own armegeddon . - daniel ferry the re-election of george w. bush is best for america and the rest of the free world .
although tensions are apparent , europe and other democracies count on the united states on many levels .
kerry is a proven opportunist who has achieved nothing greater than marrying well twice .
the rest of the world may not agree with our president , but at least they would not wonder what he really stands for or whether he would be dependable and not bend with the political winds .
i live in germany and love this country and its people as my second home .
you do not have to love our president to acknowledge him as a strong leader as compared to a waffler . - vivla ray hill i do not think it is appropriate for foreign governments to voice their choice for us president .
while most individuals have a preference , it is not in the best interest of the country that the foreign officials make their opinions public .
if their candidate of choice does not win , how will that affect the relations with the us ?
i believe it is best that they keep their comments to themselves as they must work with whomever wins the election .
it is not worth jeopardizing future relations over a comment . - elisabeth kolenko , canada it 's the us election not the european election .
quite frankly , i do n't really care what results would be best for europe . - a. barnes , charlotte , nc , usa the us president 's most important tasks are supporting and leading its own country .
but since the united states have been taking some kind of leading position in the world , they also have some responsibility to the world and the alliances / partners .
even so , most americans do not know much about or are interested in the opinion of foreign countries ' leaders . - christiane kaufmann , germany , currently living in the usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press anxious over us election newspapers on tuesday expressed anxiety and dread as they mulled the future of america , europe and the world according to who wins the cliffhanger us elections .

people in parts of byker claim their lives are at risk after street signs were blanked out with white paint .
they say emergency services will be unable to get to crimes and accidents because of the whitewashed signs .
newcastle city council says it has had difficulties in upgrading street signs , but has placed additional information for emergency vehicles .
byker village tenants ' association said at first locals thought painting out the signs was the first part of a council clean-up operation .
now they say they have been dealt an insult by council bosses .
norma johnson , who lives in headlam street in byker said : " six months ago i had to call an emergency doctor for my husband , fortunately they found the place , but the lack of street signs made it much more difficult .
the signs were originally painted white as part of a scheme to replace faded street signs newcastle city council " this is not just an inconvenience for residents and visitors to the estate but it is a wonder someone has n't died .
" emergency services often have to stop and ask other residents directions on the estate while people are waiting for medical attention . "
streets without signs include headlam street , spires lane and the streets around the northern part of byker .
a spokesman for newcastle city council said : " the signs were originally painted white as part of a scheme to replace faded street signs .
" however , the listings authority who wished to see the original character of the estate maintained opposed this and the work was left unfinished .
" work is set to start on a £ 30,000 project which will see original signage restored . "
but a spokesman for the byker village tenants ' association added : " this is an insult to the people of byker .
" it looks to many like the political leadership of the council think more of the richer areas of the city than estates like byker , gosforth and jesmond homeowners would not accept this so why should we . "

the automatic number plate recognition -lrb- anpr -rrb- is used across the uk to help police forces find vehicles which have been stolen or involved in crimes .
the lancashire force say 70 persistent offenders have been caught using anpr , and more than half have been sentenced .
stolen vehicles worth £ 350,000 have also been recovered since june 2003 .
other offenders caught by the system have received driving bans , and 181 drivers have been disqualified .
people have also been fined for driving with no insurance , defective tyres and for using their mobile phones while driving .
head of road policing , chief inspector tracie o 'gara , said : " anpr is a vital policing tool that improves our ability to enforce the law , prevent crime , and detect offenders .
" it also allows us to reduce the number of stolen vehicles and has a role to play in reducing death and injury on our roads by identifying unsafe vehicles and drivers without the correct documentation . "
anpr can detect number plates even when vehicles are being driven at more than 100mph - and it can check up to 3,000 plates every hour .
the registration numbers are then checked against records from the dvla , the police national computer and local intelligence computer systems .
police say vehicles are only stopped " where intelligence suggests that some form of road traffic offence has been committed , or when there is a known police interest in that vehicle " .

oklahoma , georgia , north dakota , ohio , kentucky , michigan , montana , utah , mississippi and arkansas backed constitutional amendments limiting marriage to a union between a man and a woman .
oregon , which had been expected to reject the proposed ban , was backing a similar amendment by a smaller margin .
ohio is reported to have also backed an amendment against civil unions for gay couples .
controversial issue george w bush has said he is seeking to change the us constitution to specify that marriage can only take place between a man and a woman . "
i think if you were to talk to -lsb- vice-president -rsb- dick cheney 's daughter , who is a lesbian , she would tell you that she 's being who she was " john kerry " as we profess tolerance ... we should n't change - or have to change - our basic views on the sanctity of marriage , " he said in the third presidential debate .
democratic candidate john kerry had responded by referring to vice-president dick cheney 's daughter who is openly gay and who works on the republican election team .
" i think if you were to talk to -lsb- vice-president -rsb- dick cheney 's daughter , who is a lesbian , she would tell you that she 's being who she was , she 's being who she was born as , " mr kerry said .
he was heavily criticised by the american media for bringing up the sexuality of mr cheney 's daughter in his campaign .
mr cheney 's views appear to fly directly in the face of president bush .
he has said people ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they wanted .
he also said individual states , and not washington , should be allowed to rule on the issue of homosexual marriage .
san francisco , in california , became the first place in the us earlier this year where gay couples were able marry .
but california 's supreme court in august annulled about 4,000 gay marriages that took place in the city .
missouri in the summer voted overwhelmingly to ban gay marriage .
gay marriage is still a hugely controversial subject across the country .
observers have said the issue is likely to have brought voters to the polls , which they say could be to the republicans ' advantage .

oklahoma , georgia , north dakota , ohio , kentucky , michigan , montana , utah , mississippi and arkansas backed constitutional amendments limiting marriage to a union between a man and a woman .
oregon , which had been expected to reject the proposed ban , was backing a similar amendment by a smaller margin .
ohio is reported to have also backed an amendment against civil unions for gay couples .

he has said people ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they wanted .
he also said individual states , and not washington , should be allowed to rule on the issue of homosexual marriage .
san francisco , in california , became the first place in the us earlier this year where gay couples were able marry .

the £ 14bn beer industry is feeling the pinch as british drinkers abandon beer in favour of wine .
beer is a traditional part of british culture , but more and more drinkers are putting down their pints and reaching for the bottle .
beer consumption has fallen by 20 % in the last 25 years , while wine drinking has grown by 260 % .
now some of our biggest brewers are taking action to stop the migration from grain to grape .
" i think wine has had a free ride where they have been on the front foot , but those days are rightfully over and we 'll have some of that business , " says steve cahillane , uk chief executive of interbrew , the world 's largest beer producer .
more wine , please mr cahillane is gearing up for a battle for the hearts and minds of british drinkers , but he has got a fight on his hands .
christopher carson , chief executive of the wine giant constellation , which produces the uk 's best selling wine brand hardy 's , is confident that our love affair with wine is not over yet .
" if we go back to 1980 , the british consumer was drinking nine litres of wine per year , now it is 24 litres , " he says .
" this is a relentless march and the consumer is going to drink more and more wine . "
respond to demand there are signs that the beer industry is tightening its belt . ... but many are tempted to switch to wine next february , the brewery where interbrew 's boddington 's cask ale has been brewed for 200 years will close due to weak demand .
" for us it was clear that the brewery itself had been built in a time when ale was nine out of 10 pints drunk , " mr cahillane says .
" today it is much smaller than that so we had to adjust our business such that we can compete . "
beer to dine for the problem for beer , it seems , is one of image .
next to stylish wine , which conjures up visions of sun-drenched valleys and exquisite cuisine , beer is outclassed , its public face haunted by the twin spectres of the beer belly and the lager lout .
wine has become an everyday tipple for many to compete with wine beer needs a serious makeover .
and that is just what it is going to get if 200 year old brewer greene king get their way .
more famous for brewing up traditional favourites ipa and abbot ale , now greene king are coming after wine 's home patch with " the beer to dine for " , a british ale created especially to go with food .
" i think it would be fantastic if a girl is going round to her boyfriend 's house and he 's offered to cook her dinner , " says rooney anand , managing director of the greene king brewery .
" instead of turning up with the obligatory bottle of wine , she brings a bottle of beer to dine for - and for her , not just for him .
" i 'd think ' yeah we 've definitely cracked it ' . "
beer and kebab mr anand faces an uphill battle .
for many britons , beer has no place on the table .
tony carty , a football-loving wine drinker from west bromwich , sums up the attitude .
" the only time i 'd drink beer with food would be with a kebab .
" if you are sitting down for a meal then you certainly do n't want to order very nice food and then put a pint of lager on the table next to it . "
aspirational mr carty is a child of the wine revolution that has swept the country over the last 15 years .
wine is going after beer 's last stronghold , the pubs from being a once-a-year luxury , wine has become an everyday tipple for many .
britain now imports more than any other non wine-growing country .
the british love affair with wine began in the upwardly mobile 1980s when brands like blue nun and le piat d 'or became must-haves for the aspirational dinner party set .
but while we flirted with wines from france and germany , the real revolution was gearing up on the other side of the world .
australia 's wine producers had spotted the burgeoning british wine market , and they were determined to make it their own .
sunshine the australian wine invasion began in earnest in 1985 when the first modern aussie wines hit the shelves .
" sunshine in a bottle they used to call it - rich ripe fruit , " says wine writer oz clarke .
" there 's no question australia virtually invented quaffable , commercial , enjoyable , pleasant wine on a grand scale . "
the wines did not just taste good , they had labels we could read and names we could pronounce .
no more did wine wannabes have to resurrect their schoolboy french , or brave the obscurities of the appellation system to order a bottle of plonk .
these wines made instant experts of anyone and they flew off the supermarket shelves .
today australian wine outsells any other country , and it has helped wine to overtake beer in supermarket sales .
but the wine industry has not finished yet .
unacceptable having conquered the supermarkets , wine is going after beer 's last stronghold , the pubs .
" we are just about to run out a very , very big programme with one of the pub chains in the uk , " says mr carson .
" i think we will not double their wine sales , i think we will treble them within two years . "
mr cahillane welcomes the challenge .
" i have seen the odd occasion where i have walked into a pub and seen a man drinking a glass of wine , " he says .
" i find that totally unacceptable , that 's our occasion , we 'll have that back . "

wine is going after beer 's last stronghold , the pubs from being a once-a-year luxury , wine has become an everyday tipple for many .
britain now imports more than any other non wine-growing country .
the british love affair with wine began in the upwardly mobile 1980s when brands like blue nun and le piat d 'or became must-haves for the aspirational dinner party set .
but while we flirted with wines from france and germany , the real revolution was gearing up on the other side of the world .
australia 's wine producers had spotted the burgeoning british wine market , and they were determined to make it their own .
sunshine the australian wine invasion began in earnest in 1985 when the first modern aussie wines hit the shelves .
" sunshine in a bottle they used to call it - rich ripe fruit , " says wine writer oz clarke .
" there 's no question australia virtually invented quaffable , commercial , enjoyable , pleasant wine on a grand scale . "
the wines did not just taste good , they had labels we could read and names we could pronounce .
no more did wine wannabes have to resurrect their schoolboy french , or brave the obscurities of the appellation system to order a bottle of plonk .
these wines made instant experts of anyone and they flew off the supermarket shelves .
today australian wine outsells any other country , and it has helped wine to overtake beer in supermarket sales .
but the wine industry has not finished yet .
unacceptable having conquered the supermarkets , wine is going after beer 's last stronghold , the pubs .
" we are just about to run out a very , very big programme with one of the pub chains in the uk , " says mr carson .
" i think we will not double their wine sales , i think we will treble them within two years . "
mr cahillane welcomes the challenge .
" i have seen the odd occasion where i have walked into a pub and seen a man drinking a glass of wine , " he says .
" i find that totally unacceptable , that 's our occasion , we 'll have that back . "

labour health committee chairman david hinchliffe had argued the issue was one of the " basic human rights " as he moved his amendment to the children bill .
despite 47 labour mps rebelling to back an outright ban , it was defeated by 424 to 75 votes .
a compromise amendment outlawing smacks which leave marks or cause mental harm was backed by 284 votes to 208 .
smacking is hitting and smacking hurts .
it causes not only physical harm it causes harm inside too david hinchliffe mp the government-backed compromise amendment , originally tabled by liberal democrat peer lord lester , allows for a mild form of smacking and retains the notion parents should be allowed to physically chastise children .
backers of the ban argued the compromise solution was a " fudge " , while tony blair has described it as a " common sense " solution .
but children 's minister margaret hodge pledged to review the change outlawing all but the mildest smack in two years ' time .
deaths mr hinchliffe 's amendment stated that " battery of a child can not be justified in any proceedings on the grounds that it constituted reasonable punishment " .
but it argued smacks may be used in order to prevent danger to a child , another person , damage to property or a crime .
moving the motion , mr hinchliffe told mps : " at least one child every week - and over 50 every year dies - at the hands of its parents .
" smacking is hitting and smacking hurts .
it causes not only physical harm it causes harm inside too . "
so , yes , this amendment would criminalise hitting to exactly the same extent as hitting adults is criminalised .
" that is equality and children - far more fragile and vulnerable than us - deserve nothing less . "
have your say there is a world of difference between discipline and abuse richard , sheffield , uk send us your comments the children 's minister argued that the compromise amendment toughened up the law on physical punishment but did not criminalise parents for administering a " light smack " .
" there is a world of difference between a light smack and violence or abuse .
we should recognise that the vast majority of parents understand that difference and would never deliberately harm their children .
" the government simply does not believe that every single instance of parental smacking should be an offence . "
tory andrew turner said the compromise caused more confusion , saying it removed the " reasonable chastisement " defence for assault and battery of a child but retained it for actual bodily harm .
' loving parents ' plaid cymru 's simon thomas pointed out that the common law defence once applied to wives and servants as well .
liberal democrat annette brooke backed mr hinchliffe 's motion saying smacking was an " inefficient punishment " which had other consequences such as engendering a physical disrespect of others .
tory andrew robathan described those calling for a ban as arrogant .
he said : " i have two small children to whom i 'm devoted and i love them more than anything else in the world .
very , very occasionally i smack them - much more often i threaten them with it and funnily enough it works rather well . "
the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children criticised the government compromise saying it defined an acceptable threshold of violence towards children .
the children bill also introduces a children 's commissioner for england and places a " duty of care " on all services to prevent harm to children .
it also introduces many operational reforms of social services including the creation of a national database of records held on every single child , to improve tracking across different services .
the bill was given an unopposed third reading and now returns to the lords .

we should recognise that the vast majority of parents understand that difference and would never deliberately harm their children .
" the government simply does not believe that every single instance of parental smacking should be an offence . "
tory andrew turner said the compromise caused more confusion , saying it removed the " reasonable chastisement " defence for assault and battery of a child but retained it for actual bodily harm .
' loving parents ' plaid cymru 's simon thomas pointed out that the common law defence once applied to wives and servants as well .
liberal democrat annette brooke backed mr hinchliffe 's motion saying smacking was an " inefficient punishment " which had other consequences such as engendering a physical disrespect of others .
tory andrew robathan described those calling for a ban as arrogant .
he said : " i have two small children to whom i 'm devoted and i love them more than anything else in the world .
very , very occasionally i smack them - much more often i threaten them with it and funnily enough it works rather well . "
the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children criticised the government compromise saying it defined an acceptable threshold of violence towards children .
the children bill also introduces a children 's commissioner for england and places a " duty of care " on all services to prevent harm to children .
it also introduces many operational reforms of social services including the creation of a national database of records held on every single child , to improve tracking across different services .
the bill was given an unopposed third reading and now returns to the lords .

labour health committee chairman david hinchliffe had argued the issue was one of the " basic human rights " as he moved his amendment to the children bill .

smacking is hitting and smacking hurts .
it causes not only physical harm it causes harm inside too david hinchliffe mp the government-backed compromise amendment , originally tabled by liberal democrat peer lord lester , allows for a mild form of smacking and retains the notion parents should be allowed to physically chastise children .

moving the motion , mr hinchliffe told mps : " at least one child every week - and over 50 every year dies - at the hands of its parents .
" smacking is hitting and smacking hurts .
it causes not only physical harm it causes harm inside too . "

current wardens , deployed by the police service , will be withdrawn from enforcing on-street parking regulations to focus on areas such as road safety .
mr spellar said the department of regional development -lrb- drd -rrb- will take over responsibility for parking fines .
it will change the law to include the use of clamps , and offences will be civil not criminal .
this has led to fears that clamping will increase .
mr spellar said : " the decision to employ a specialist contractor is based on extensive research on the best practice of enforcement across the uk . "
the psni said it was to withdraw staff from enforcing on-street parking restrictions to focus on other areas such as road safety .
the roads service is also to lose about 30 staff who look after car parks and these positions will also be filled by people from a private company .
albert mills from the amalgamated transport and general workers union said it would have implications for civil servants and motorists .
sdlp assembly member alasdair mcdonnell said the decision to privatise traffic wardens was " bad news " for motorists as parking tickets and clamping would now be " motivated by profit rather than public safety " .
