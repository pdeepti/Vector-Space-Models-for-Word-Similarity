program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 ukrainians protest election fraud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 20,000 opposition supporters gathered in kiev the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise . with the will of the people apparently behind him , opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yuschenko urged thousands of supporters to remain on the streets until officials called the election for him . exit polls on sunday indicated yuschenko , who wants to steer the country out of russia 's shadow and towards europe , had won 54 percent of the vote compared with the 43 percent of his pro-russia rival , prime minister viktor yanukovich , according to the independent razumkov ukrainian center for economic and political studies and the kiev international institute for sociology -lrb- kmis -rrb- . but the country 's central election committee said on monday that yanukovich held a slight lead - 48.9 percent to 47.5 percent - over his challenger .
election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

" this really is a gathering of the whole international community . " participants will include " those who were for the war , those who were against ... all coming together to reaffirm their interest and commitment ... in supporting the process of political transition in iraq , " she added . france , indirectly attacked earlier this month by iraq 's prime minister ayad allawi for playing a " spectator role " in the country , intends to push for an iraqi transition period that is open to all political forces and can fit into the process of the withdrawal of foreign troops .

" we hope that a signal of unity among the international community will result from it , " the source added . italy 's outgoing foreign minister , franco frattini , has said rome wants to see " an ' iraqization ' of the peace process , with total control of security being handed back to the legitimate representatives of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.11.2004 europe focuses anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guarding or observing ?
fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .
“ i don ’ t think we should change our point of view , we should not make our laws more aggressive , ” franz said .
“ but that may change , depending on a threat or attack . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .

“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .

germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.11.2004 europe focuses anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guarding or observing ?
fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .

the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .
“ i don ’ t think we should change our point of view , we should not make our laws more aggressive , ” franz said .
“ but that may change , depending on a threat or attack . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .

the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .
however elbaradei said the up to two tons of uranium gas -lrb- uf6 -rrb- made was not enough to make a bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the islamic republic insists it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to become self-sufficient in producing fuel for a series of atomic energy reactors it plans to build in the future .
but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 . " the suspension is voluntary and not a legal obligation , " ramazanzadeh said .
" it is aimed at building trust and corresponds to our national interests ... and it is us who will decide on the duration of the suspension . " and while hopeful the accord would work , british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that the row could still end up in new york .

" we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .

but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 . " the suspension is voluntary and not a legal obligation , " ramazanzadeh said .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko !

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .

both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .

no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 ukrainians protest election fraud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 20,000 opposition supporters gathered in kiev the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise . with the will of the people apparently behind him , opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yuschenko urged thousands of supporters to remain on the streets until officials called the election for him . exit polls on sunday indicated yuschenko , who wants to steer the country out of russia 's shadow and towards europe , had won 54 percent of the vote compared with the 43 percent of his pro-russia rival , prime minister viktor yanukovich , according to the independent razumkov ukrainian center for economic and political studies and the kiev international institute for sociology -lrb- kmis -rrb- . but the country 's central election committee said on monday that yanukovich held a slight lead - 48.9 percent to 47.5 percent - over his challenger .
election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 ukrainians protest election fraud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 20,000 opposition supporters gathered in kiev the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise . with the will of the people apparently behind him , opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yuschenko urged thousands of supporters to remain on the streets until officials called the election for him . exit polls on sunday indicated yuschenko , who wants to steer the country out of russia 's shadow and towards europe , had won 54 percent of the vote compared with the 43 percent of his pro-russia rival , prime minister viktor yanukovich , according to the independent razumkov ukrainian center for economic and political studies and the kiev international institute for sociology -lrb- kmis -rrb- . but the country 's central election committee said on monday that yanukovich held a slight lead - 48.9 percent to 47.5 percent - over his challenger .
election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .

no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .

he began his visit in the lithuanian capital vilnius , where he praised the country 's quick ratification of the eu constitution . with the aim of bolstering already close ties with lithuania , latvia and estonia , köhler 's will spend one day apiece in each of the former soviet republics and new european union members .
he praised the zeal with which all three countries have attempted to rejoin europe both culturally and economically . " the dynamic nature of the people here is good for the eu , " köhler said after arriving in lithuania . after meeting with his lithuanian counterpart valdas adamkus , köhler commended lithuania for becoming the first of the 25 eu members to ratify the bloc 's new constitution .
adamkus signed the parliament 's approval of the document earlier on friday . köhler 's trip aims to strengthen germany 's position as the region 's most important trading partner , as well as highlight berlin 's role as the first stop for the baltic republics when they need diplomatic support on international issues . both köhler and adamkus called the two countries ' relations " very close " and the lithuanian president thanked germany for its willingness to organize nato 's air surveillance for the baltic region starting next autumn .
köhler said he hoped to encourage greater interaction between the citizens of the two countries . " i will personally ensure that people are welcomed with open arms , " he said . nuclear power adamkus also tried to get german support for a planned new nuclear reactor for lithuania , which has committed itself to shutting down a risky chernobyl-type plant by 2009 .
more than 80 percent of the country 's electricity needs are met by nuclear power . " lithuania is not prepared to stop using atomic energy , " adamkus said , adding lithuania hoped foreign investment would enable " a modern reactor to be built . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old town of vilnius , lithuania .

a referendum calling for a ban on skyscrapers won a slim majority on sunday . when it comes to building in the bavarian capital , the famous onion domes of the marienkirche - not the sky - will be the limit in the future .
a referendum that passed with a 50.8 percent margin set the 100 meter high -lrb- 328-foot -rrb- towers of the church as the highest a building can rise in the picturesque city .
the immediate victims of the referendum are a planned 148 meter high building by siemens and the süddeutsche publishing house 's 145-meter high planned high-rise in the east of the city . both the social democratic and green party city government and opposition parties had approved the construction of the two buildings - to the horror of former mayor georg kronawitter . against the will of his party colleague and successor , kronawitter - under whose watch a 114-meter high-rise was built - began a referendum against the tall buildings . critics rolled their eyes , and one newspaper called him the " don quixote of urbanism . " " kronawitter should follow his high-rise attack with a similar proposal .

at the end of september , germany 's biggest department store chain had said it planned to return to profit in 2005 , when it expected to book operating profit of around € 110 million -lrb- $ 143 million -rrb- .
but at the beginning of november , karstadtquelle revised downwards its sales forecast for the current year , saying it expected revenues to decline by around seven percent in 2004 , instead of 4.5-5 percent as previously anticipated .
karstadtquelle shareholders were meeting in düsseldorf on monday to vote on whether to approve an injection of fresh capital to ensure the group 's survival .

the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .
however elbaradei said the up to two tons of uranium gas -lrb- uf6 -rrb- made was not enough to make a bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the islamic republic insists it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to become self-sufficient in producing fuel for a series of atomic energy reactors it plans to build in the future .
but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 . " the suspension is voluntary and not a legal obligation , " ramazanzadeh said .
" it is aimed at building trust and corresponds to our national interests ... and it is us who will decide on the duration of the suspension . " and while hopeful the accord would work , british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that the row could still end up in new york . " if there is a failure by iran to meet its obligations then britain , and also germany and france reserve our collective right to refer the matter to the security council , " he said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to stop nuclear program the eu has welcomed an iranian pledge to fully suspend uranium enrichment , ending a deadlock over washington 's charges that tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.11.2004 iran freezes nuclear activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea hopes to verify the suspension this week iran said it was freezing its controversial nuclear fuel work monday after brokering a deal with britain , france and germany .
the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .
however elbaradei said the up to two tons of uranium gas -lrb- uf6 -rrb- made was not enough to make a bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the islamic republic insists it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to become self-sufficient in producing fuel for a series of atomic energy reactors it plans to build in the future .
but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .

but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany cultivates the culture of sorbs but not of muslims numerous politicians have recently called on muslims to increase their efforts to integrate into german society .
but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .
that must not happen .
but so far only the very beginnings of such a development have been identified .
only in such cases should - and must - the state intervene . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

7 . three years ago when germany ranked 20th in the same test , the country that had prided itself on its education system was stunned .
heading the public outcry , the government moved quickly to pass national education standards regulating how much knowledge students should have in german , math and a foreign language . no new changes coming but those changes have not yet produced the positive results people had hoped for . " bigger changes in such a complex system like the school system can not be expected within one and a half years , " said doris ahnen , the culture minister of the state of rhineland-palatinate . politicians said more changes were not likely in light of the new results .

the official release date is dec .
7 . three years ago when germany ranked 20th in the same test , the country that had prided itself on its education system was stunned .
heading the public outcry , the government moved quickly to pass national education standards regulating how much knowledge students should have in german , math and a foreign language . no new changes coming but those changes have not yet produced the positive results people had hoped for . " bigger changes in such a complex system like the school system can not be expected within one and a half years , " said doris ahnen , the culture minister of the state of rhineland-palatinate . politicians said more changes were not likely in light of the new results .
instead , the system needs to be given more time to improve . math better , reading worse during the last round of testing , pisa tested writing and comprehension skills .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 ukrainians protest election fraud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 20,000 opposition supporters gathered in kiev the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise . with the will of the people apparently behind him , opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yuschenko urged thousands of supporters to remain on the streets until officials called the election for him . exit polls on sunday indicated yuschenko , who wants to steer the country out of russia 's shadow and towards europe , had won 54 percent of the vote compared with the 43 percent of his pro-russia rival , prime minister viktor yanukovich , according to the independent razumkov ukrainian center for economic and political studies and the kiev international institute for sociology -lrb- kmis -rrb- . but the country 's central election committee said on monday that yanukovich held a slight lead - 48.9 percent to 47.5 percent - over his challenger .
election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .

early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .

“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .
“ i don ’ t think we should change our point of view , we should not make our laws more aggressive , ” franz said .
“ but that may change , depending on a threat or attack . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 ukrainians protest election fraud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 20,000 opposition supporters gathered in kiev the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise . with the will of the people apparently behind him , opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yuschenko urged thousands of supporters to remain on the streets until officials called the election for him . exit polls on sunday indicated yuschenko , who wants to steer the country out of russia 's shadow and towards europe , had won 54 percent of the vote compared with the 43 percent of his pro-russia rival , prime minister viktor yanukovich , according to the independent razumkov ukrainian center for economic and political studies and the kiev international institute for sociology -lrb- kmis -rrb- . but the country 's central election committee said on monday that yanukovich held a slight lead - 48.9 percent to 47.5 percent - over his challenger .
election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

the official release date is dec .
7 . three years ago when germany ranked 20th in the same test , the country that had prided itself on its education system was stunned .
heading the public outcry , the government moved quickly to pass national education standards regulating how much knowledge students should have in german , math and a foreign language . no new changes coming but those changes have not yet produced the positive results people had hoped for . " bigger changes in such a complex system like the school system can not be expected within one and a half years , " said doris ahnen , the culture minister of the state of rhineland-palatinate . politicians said more changes were not likely in light of the new results .
instead , the system needs to be given more time to improve . math better , reading worse during the last round of testing , pisa tested writing and comprehension skills .
this time around , the focus was on problem-solving , reading , science and mathematical skills .
the oecd surveyed 5,000 15-year-old students at 200 randomly selected german schools in the early months of 2003 . while they were able to improve to 17th place in mathematics , the study 's focal point this time around , german students remained substandard in reading and comprehension , ranking 20th , according to the leaked results . immigrants , poor students fall behind the study also revealed a massive disparity in educational performance based on household income .
children of academics , or parents with high incomes were three times as likely to take the abitur , the german college prep school 's final exam .
no other country surveyed showed such a margin of difference . children from immigrant and lower-income families performed far worse in school .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator of the oecd , criticized germany 's three-tier school system for leaving lower-performing children behind . by separating children after the fourth grade into either higher or lower-grade schools , " the weaker students are pushed away instead of individually encouraged , " said schliecher , who would not comment directly on the study in an interview with capital magazine . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .

the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .

many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 .

the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .
however elbaradei said the up to two tons of uranium gas -lrb- uf6 -rrb- made was not enough to make a bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the islamic republic insists it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to become self-sufficient in producing fuel for a series of atomic energy reactors it plans to build in the future .
but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 . " the suspension is voluntary and not a legal obligation , " ramazanzadeh said .
" it is aimed at building trust and corresponds to our national interests ... and it is us who will decide on the duration of the suspension . " and while hopeful the accord would work , british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that the row could still end up in new york . " if there is a failure by iran to meet its obligations then britain , and also germany and france reserve our collective right to refer the matter to the security council , " he said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to stop nuclear program the eu has welcomed an iranian pledge to fully suspend uranium enrichment , ending a deadlock over washington 's charges that tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons .

a referendum calling for a ban on skyscrapers won a slim majority on sunday . when it comes to building in the bavarian capital , the famous onion domes of the marienkirche - not the sky - will be the limit in the future .
a referendum that passed with a 50.8 percent margin set the 100 meter high -lrb- 328-foot -rrb- towers of the church as the highest a building can rise in the picturesque city .
the immediate victims of the referendum are a planned 148 meter high building by siemens and the süddeutsche publishing house 's 145-meter high planned high-rise in the east of the city . both the social democratic and green party city government and opposition parties had approved the construction of the two buildings - to the horror of former mayor georg kronawitter . against the will of his party colleague and successor , kronawitter - under whose watch a 114-meter high-rise was built - began a referendum against the tall buildings . critics rolled their eyes , and one newspaper called him the " don quixote of urbanism . " " kronawitter should follow his high-rise attack with a similar proposal .
all cars that drive faster than 18 km / h -lrb- 11 mph -rrb- should leave the city , " wrote gerhard matzig in the süddeutsche zeitung , owned by the süddeutsche publishing house . " streets could be replaced by mud roads , cars through horse coaches and high-rises through mud huts .

the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .

but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 .

iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .
however elbaradei said the up to two tons of uranium gas -lrb- uf6 -rrb- made was not enough to make a bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the islamic republic insists it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to become self-sufficient in producing fuel for a series of atomic energy reactors it plans to build in the future .
but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 . " the suspension is voluntary and not a legal obligation , " ramazanzadeh said .
" it is aimed at building trust and corresponds to our national interests ... and it is us who will decide on the duration of the suspension . " and while hopeful the accord would work , british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that the row could still end up in new york . " if there is a failure by iran to meet its obligations then britain , and also germany and france reserve our collective right to refer the matter to the security council , " he said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to stop nuclear program the eu has welcomed an iranian pledge to fully suspend uranium enrichment , ending a deadlock over washington 's charges that tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .

the official release date is dec .
7 . three years ago when germany ranked 20th in the same test , the country that had prided itself on its education system was stunned .
heading the public outcry , the government moved quickly to pass national education standards regulating how much knowledge students should have in german , math and a foreign language . no new changes coming but those changes have not yet produced the positive results people had hoped for . " bigger changes in such a complex system like the school system can not be expected within one and a half years , " said doris ahnen , the culture minister of the state of rhineland-palatinate . politicians said more changes were not likely in light of the new results .
instead , the system needs to be given more time to improve . math better , reading worse during the last round of testing , pisa tested writing and comprehension skills .
this time around , the focus was on problem-solving , reading , science and mathematical skills .
the oecd surveyed 5,000 15-year-old students at 200 randomly selected german schools in the early months of 2003 . while they were able to improve to 17th place in mathematics , the study 's focal point this time around , german students remained substandard in reading and comprehension , ranking 20th , according to the leaked results . immigrants , poor students fall behind the study also revealed a massive disparity in educational performance based on household income .
children of academics , or parents with high incomes were three times as likely to take the abitur , the german college prep school 's final exam .
no other country surveyed showed such a margin of difference . children from immigrant and lower-income families performed far worse in school .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator of the oecd , criticized germany 's three-tier school system for leaving lower-performing children behind . by separating children after the fourth grade into either higher or lower-grade schools , " the weaker students are pushed away instead of individually encouraged , " said schliecher , who would not comment directly on the study in an interview with capital magazine . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 opinion : who 's afraid of the sorbs ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany cultivates the culture of sorbs but not of muslims numerous politicians have recently called on muslims to increase their efforts to integrate into german society .
but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .
that must not happen .
but so far only the very beginnings of such a development have been identified .
only in such cases should - and must - the state intervene . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

but at the beginning of november , karstadtquelle revised downwards its sales forecast for the current year , saying it expected revenues to decline by around seven percent in 2004 , instead of 4.5-5 percent as previously anticipated .
karstadtquelle shareholders were meeting in düsseldorf on monday to vote on whether to approve an injection of fresh capital to ensure the group 's survival .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .

those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .

" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .
that must not happen .
but so far only the very beginnings of such a development have been identified .

a referendum calling for a ban on skyscrapers won a slim majority on sunday . when it comes to building in the bavarian capital , the famous onion domes of the marienkirche - not the sky - will be the limit in the future .
a referendum that passed with a 50.8 percent margin set the 100 meter high -lrb- 328-foot -rrb- towers of the church as the highest a building can rise in the picturesque city .
the immediate victims of the referendum are a planned 148 meter high building by siemens and the süddeutsche publishing house 's 145-meter high planned high-rise in the east of the city . both the social democratic and green party city government and opposition parties had approved the construction of the two buildings - to the horror of former mayor georg kronawitter . against the will of his party colleague and successor , kronawitter - under whose watch a 114-meter high-rise was built - began a referendum against the tall buildings . critics rolled their eyes , and one newspaper called him the " don quixote of urbanism . " " kronawitter should follow his high-rise attack with a similar proposal .
all cars that drive faster than 18 km / h -lrb- 11 mph -rrb- should leave the city , " wrote gerhard matzig in the süddeutsche zeitung , owned by the süddeutsche publishing house .

the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .

many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.11.2004 iran freezes nuclear activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea hopes to verify the suspension this week iran said it was freezing its controversial nuclear fuel work monday after brokering a deal with britain , france and germany .
the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .
however elbaradei said the up to two tons of uranium gas -lrb- uf6 -rrb- made was not enough to make a bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the islamic republic insists it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to become self-sufficient in producing fuel for a series of atomic energy reactors it plans to build in the future .
but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 . " the suspension is voluntary and not a legal obligation , " ramazanzadeh said .
" it is aimed at building trust and corresponds to our national interests ... and it is us who will decide on the duration of the suspension . " and while hopeful the accord would work , british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that the row could still end up in new york . " if there is a failure by iran to meet its obligations then britain , and also germany and france reserve our collective right to refer the matter to the security council , " he said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to stop nuclear program the eu has welcomed an iranian pledge to fully suspend uranium enrichment , ending a deadlock over washington 's charges that tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.11.2004 europe focuses anti-terror efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guarding or observing ?
fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .
“ i don ’ t think we should change our point of view , we should not make our laws more aggressive , ” franz said .
“ but that may change , depending on a threat or attack . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

the official release date is dec .
7 . three years ago when germany ranked 20th in the same test , the country that had prided itself on its education system was stunned .
heading the public outcry , the government moved quickly to pass national education standards regulating how much knowledge students should have in german , math and a foreign language . no new changes coming but those changes have not yet produced the positive results people had hoped for . " bigger changes in such a complex system like the school system can not be expected within one and a half years , " said doris ahnen , the culture minister of the state of rhineland-palatinate . politicians said more changes were not likely in light of the new results .
instead , the system needs to be given more time to improve . math better , reading worse during the last round of testing , pisa tested writing and comprehension skills .
this time around , the focus was on problem-solving , reading , science and mathematical skills .
the oecd surveyed 5,000 15-year-old students at 200 randomly selected german schools in the early months of 2003 . while they were able to improve to 17th place in mathematics , the study 's focal point this time around , german students remained substandard in reading and comprehension , ranking 20th , according to the leaked results . immigrants , poor students fall behind the study also revealed a massive disparity in educational performance based on household income .
children of academics , or parents with high incomes were three times as likely to take the abitur , the german college prep school 's final exam .
no other country surveyed showed such a margin of difference . children from immigrant and lower-income families performed far worse in school .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator of the oecd , criticized germany 's three-tier school system for leaving lower-performing children behind . by separating children after the fourth grade into either higher or lower-grade schools , " the weaker students are pushed away instead of individually encouraged , " said schliecher , who would not comment directly on the study in an interview with capital magazine . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 ukrainians protest election fraud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 20,000 opposition supporters gathered in kiev the outcome of a bitter election in ukraine on sunday was anything but clear monday , with exit polls showing the pro-western challenger as the winner , but official results indicating otherwise . with the will of the people apparently behind him , opposition leader and presidential candidate viktor yuschenko urged thousands of supporters to remain on the streets until officials called the election for him . exit polls on sunday indicated yuschenko , who wants to steer the country out of russia 's shadow and towards europe , had won 54 percent of the vote compared with the 43 percent of his pro-russia rival , prime minister viktor yanukovich , according to the independent razumkov ukrainian center for economic and political studies and the kiev international institute for sociology -lrb- kmis -rrb- . but the country 's central election committee said on monday that yanukovich held a slight lead - 48.9 percent to 47.5 percent - over his challenger .
election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovich the opposition leader wants to move towards membership of the european union and the us-led nato military alliance , while yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- has promised to make russian a second official language and allow dual citizenship . the election has sparked intense rivalry between washington and moscow , with the west seeing ukraine as a buffer with an increasingly authoritarian russia . us president george w. bush has served notice to kuchma that the united states will review its relations with ukraine if the presidential vote is not fair . russia , which under putin has worked to restore moscow 's influence in much of the former soviet union , is determined to keep its fellow-slav neighbor in friendly hands . 5,000 election monitors on hand the first round on oct .
31 , in which yushchenko was just 156,000 votes ahead , was slammed as a " step backward " for democracy by international observers who said state media favored the official candidate . some 37 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the runoff election , which was being observed by nearly 5,000 international monitors . afp / dw staff -lrb- win / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukrainian election : viktor vs. viktor ukrainians vote sunday for a new president in a bitterly-fought runoff election that will determine whether this strategic former soviet republic turns toward europe or remains under moscow 's shadow .

the german public deficit breached a key eu limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- both in 2002 and 2003 and is expected to do so again this year , contrary to rules of the european stability and growth pact .
and while berlin has pledged to bring its deficit ratio back below 3 percent next year , many observers remain sceptical that it will succeed .
" despite expectations for a fall in the deficit , there is a substantial risk that the 3 percent limit will be exceeded again next year , " the german central bank wrote in its november monthly report published monday .
earlier this month , the government unveiled a package of additional measures aimed at ensuring the deficit ratio is cut to 2.9 percent in 2005 .
but most of the measures were simply one-off measures " that will burden future budgets , " the bundesbank complained .

the un 's atomic watchdog sees the move as easing fears the islamic regime is seeking the bomb . iranian officials said it would suspend its sensitive nuclear activities surrounding the enrichment of uranium , likely avoiding referral to the un security council for possible sanctions . " we respect our commitments and in accordance with the agreement , we are beginning the suspension today , " iranian government spokesman abdollah ramazanzadeh told reporters . in vienna , the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei said his watchdog organization should be able to verify the suspension by thursday , when the agency is due to decide on the next step in the stand-off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- mohamed elbaradei .
" i think pretty much everything has come to a halt right now so we are just trying to make sure that everything has been stopped , " he said .
the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction . " iran agreed a week ago with britain , france and germany to suspend as of monday all its uranium enrichment-related activities , including making uranium gas and building centrifuges , in order to avoid being taken to the un security council over the matter .
iranian state media also said the suspension had either started or would commence monday , but gave no details on the precise timing of the halt . us remains skeptical the united states accuses tehran 's clerical rulers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , and president george w. bush has already lumped iran into an " axis of evil " . iran had already frozen the actual enrichment process in october 2003 , but had pressed on with work on other parts of the fuel cycle - including converting raw uranium into the gas fed into centrifuges and making the centrifuges themselves . iran has been accused of acting in bad faith with diplomats in vienna saying it had accelerated its conversion work in the run-up to the suspension .
however elbaradei said the up to two tons of uranium gas -lrb- uf6 -rrb- made was not enough to make a bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the islamic republic insists it only wants to enrich uranium to low levels , so as to become self-sufficient in producing fuel for a series of atomic energy reactors it plans to build in the future .
but once it has mastered the fuel cycle , iran could divert its program towards making highly enriched uranium - the explosive core of a nuclear bomb .
many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .
it has said it is ready to discuss ways in which it can operate the fuel cycle under full iaea supervision that would ease any alarm . officials in europe have also signaled they will not allow the talks to drag on fruitlessly too far into 2005 . " the suspension is voluntary and not a legal obligation , " ramazanzadeh said .
" it is aimed at building trust and corresponds to our national interests ... and it is us who will decide on the duration of the suspension . " and while hopeful the accord would work , british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that the row could still end up in new york . " if there is a failure by iran to meet its obligations then britain , and also germany and france reserve our collective right to refer the matter to the security council , " he said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran to stop nuclear program the eu has welcomed an iranian pledge to fully suspend uranium enrichment , ending a deadlock over washington 's charges that tehran is secretly developing nuclear weapons .

the iaea chief told the bbc that tehran 's suspension was " a step in the right direction .

many western officials fear that iran is seeking the " option " to build a bomb . europe brokers deal under the deal with the three european states , iran is to maintain its suspension while talks on a long-term resolution to the stand-off are in progress .
negotiations on defining long-term guarantees on iran 's peaceful intentions as well as a package of incentives for tehran are scheduled to begin in mid-december . ideally the eu-3 would like iran to abandon its fuel cycle work altogether .
but iran is standing by its right to the fuel cycle , saying enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , of which it is a signatory .

the court cited justice and foreign policy as the main areas requiring changes to the constitution .
the increased powers that national parliaments will have if the european constitution is ratified also require a change in the french constitution , as the role of its national parliament must be defined by the constitution .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .
but rather the question of whether a " state within a state " emerges - with its own rules and its own law .

but germany should n't become fixated on the issue of parallel societies , according to dw 's peter philipp . they live in their own communities , speak their own language , cultivate their own culture , even street signs are bi-lingual .
and the state even guarantees cultivation of their culture and language .
truly a parallel society , but not the sort about which people throughout the country have been arguing and ranting .
the issue is the 60,000-head slavic ethnic group , the sorbs , who have lived in brandenburg and saxony for centuries . no one 's afraid of the sorbs , nor that they proudly cultivate and preserve their ways .
instead , they 're afraid of the others , of which there are already 3.2 million : the muslims in germany . the overwhelming majority , the turks , are apparently subliminally suspected of being osama bin laden 's german fifth column .
how else do you explain the daily accusations that a dangerous parallel society has developed in turkish districts or city ghettos which goes against the german , christian culture ? a thorn in germany 's side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hysteria was triggered by the recent murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , not some occurrence in germany .
but what happened in amsterdam , attracted the attention of all those who have long viewed the growing number of muslims here as a thorn in germany 's side .
all at once , the lot of muslim women in germany has become an issue , people are discussing in what language muslims should hold religious services , and , generally , the notion of a multicultural society has been declared dead before the majority of german society even had time to get accustomed to it . and politicians of all persuasions feel obliged to voice their own ideas and to make appeals on the issue .
as if new facts and a new " issue " had arisen .
but actually the focus is primarily well-established circumstances that could have been changed and improved long ago .
but nothing was done - whether out of disinterest or shortsightedness - thus practically pushing muslims on germany to seclude themselves . there is no probate measure against the apparent grievances : those muslims who do n't speak german today wo n't learn it within one or two weeks .
those who have lived here for years and still have n't integrated , wo n't succeed in doing so now .
the dominant society will ensure that that 's the case . what about chinatowns ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to now become fixated on " parallel societies " would be wrong and would more likely cause the opposite of the desired effect , for it 's natural that people feel attracted to their own kind when they 're away from home .
" chinatowns " in north america attest to that fact , just as the italian , hispanic and other quarters there do .
" germantown , " where german immigrants used to settle in the united states , is today practically a historical monument . such places are not the problem , as the example of the sorbs shows .

the neue ruhr / neue rhein-zeitung of essen , where many turks live , said that quick diagnoses from the politicians and the media would only generate hysteria .
expecting self-healing forces of ' modernism ' from islam can ’ t work , it said .
protestants and catholics needed hundreds of years for the basic attitude which is now taken as self-evident : tolerance of other beliefs .
what the muslims need to do , said the paper , is to rigorously pull away the ground that the warriors of faith in their orbit stand on and renew their societies from within .
the germans need to do two things , the paper wrote : use the full power of the law against all who in word and deed put the koran above the rules of democratic society , while continuing to welcome those muslims who realize what ’ s at stake .
the stuttgarter zeitung suggested that integration always happens through work and through growing prosperity .
the shared language of locals and immigrants was the language of success .
this communication has almost become mute , it said .
mass unemployment and fear of terror , wrote the stuttgart paper , stirs great mistrust especially between germans and muslims .
particularly in big cities , many muslims , who claim to be withdrawing for religious reasons , use this isolation to shield criminal sub-cultures .
it has to be part of the predominant german culture not to tolerate this , and that , too , needs to be stated clearly .
that will lead to well-functioning multiculturalism .
in barcelona , el periodico saw president bush as sabotaging the european initiative with iran over its nuclear program .
the bush administration is repeating with iran the strategy it already used to justify the invasion of iraq , said the spanish paper .
the threats are coming just at the time when the european initiative is starting to show some success .
washington has before sabotaged the work of the united nations inspectors in iraq , and now the hawks in the white house are trying in the same way to cause the tripartite negotiations of britain , france and germany with iran to fail .
the us doesn ’ t want a dialogue , said el periodico , and it ’ s illusory to expect bush to switch to a moderate course .
italy ’ s corriere della sera previewed the international conference on iraq being held in sharm el-sheik , egypt , on monday and tuesday .
the strong multi-lateral nature of the conference makes it an immediate success , said the milan-based paper .
those who wanted iraq liberated and those who opposed the invasion are all sitting together for the first time .
elections , borders , military presence and money are the topics of discussion .
to address this urgent issue , said corriere della serra , an agreement on borders would be a help .
the interim iraqi government accuses syria and iran of supporting terrorism in the country , noted the paper .
liberation in paris , pointed out that together with the russians , the french were the first to call for such an iraq conference .
however , paris then had to drop some of its demands .
france wanted a timetable for withdrawal of coalition troops but had to make do with a reference to a time limit for their presence .
putting a brave face on it now , said the paris paper , is assuming that the conference will at lead to some result , because it shows that the international community supports the political transition in iraq .
in this , said liberation , france sees yet another vindication of its moral victory in the disputes over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2004 press review : peaceful islam european editorials on monday discussed the integration of muslims in germany as well as the international conference taking place in sharm el-sheik , egypt , regarding the future of iraq . over the weekend around 20,000 muslims took to cologne 's streets in a demonstration stressing that islam is a peaceful religion and that those who perpetrate violence in its name are criminals .
the neue ruhr / neue rhein-zeitung of essen , where many turks live , said that quick diagnoses from the politicians and the media would only generate hysteria .
expecting self-healing forces of ' modernism ' from islam can ’ t work , it said .
protestants and catholics needed hundreds of years for the basic attitude which is now taken as self-evident : tolerance of other beliefs .
what the muslims need to do , said the paper , is to rigorously pull away the ground that the warriors of faith in their orbit stand on and renew their societies from within .
the germans need to do two things , the paper wrote : use the full power of the law against all who in word and deed put the koran above the rules of democratic society , while continuing to welcome those muslims who realize what ’ s at stake .
the stuttgarter zeitung suggested that integration always happens through work and through growing prosperity .
the shared language of locals and immigrants was the language of success .
this communication has almost become mute , it said .
mass unemployment and fear of terror , wrote the stuttgart paper , stirs great mistrust especially between germans and muslims .
particularly in big cities , many muslims , who claim to be withdrawing for religious reasons , use this isolation to shield criminal sub-cultures .
it has to be part of the predominant german culture not to tolerate this , and that , too , needs to be stated clearly .
that will lead to well-functioning multiculturalism .
in barcelona , el periodico saw president bush as sabotaging the european initiative with iran over its nuclear program .
the bush administration is repeating with iran the strategy it already used to justify the invasion of iraq , said the spanish paper .
the threats are coming just at the time when the european initiative is starting to show some success .
washington has before sabotaged the work of the united nations inspectors in iraq , and now the hawks in the white house are trying in the same way to cause the tripartite negotiations of britain , france and germany with iran to fail .
the us doesn ’ t want a dialogue , said el periodico , and it ’ s illusory to expect bush to switch to a moderate course .
italy ’ s corriere della sera previewed the international conference on iraq being held in sharm el-sheik , egypt , on monday and tuesday .
the strong multi-lateral nature of the conference makes it an immediate success , said the milan-based paper .
those who wanted iraq liberated and those who opposed the invasion are all sitting together for the first time .
elections , borders , military presence and money are the topics of discussion .
to address this urgent issue , said corriere della serra , an agreement on borders would be a help .
the interim iraqi government accuses syria and iran of supporting terrorism in the country , noted the paper .
liberation in paris , pointed out that together with the russians , the french were the first to call for such an iraq conference .
however , paris then had to drop some of its demands .
france wanted a timetable for withdrawal of coalition troops but had to make do with a reference to a time limit for their presence .
putting a brave face on it now , said the paris paper , is assuming that the conference will at lead to some result , because it shows that the international community supports the political transition in iraq .
in this , said liberation , france sees yet another vindication of its moral victory in the disputes over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands at cologne anti-violence rally some 20,000 people took to the streets in the western german city of cologne on sunday , waving german and turkish flags , to protest against the use of violence in the name of islam .

the official release date is dec .
7 . three years ago when germany ranked 20th in the same test , the country that had prided itself on its education system was stunned .
heading the public outcry , the government moved quickly to pass national education standards regulating how much knowledge students should have in german , math and a foreign language . no new changes coming but those changes have not yet produced the positive results people had hoped for . " bigger changes in such a complex system like the school system can not be expected within one and a half years , " said doris ahnen , the culture minister of the state of rhineland-palatinate . politicians said more changes were not likely in light of the new results .
instead , the system needs to be given more time to improve . math better , reading worse during the last round of testing , pisa tested writing and comprehension skills .
this time around , the focus was on problem-solving , reading , science and mathematical skills .
the oecd surveyed 5,000 15-year-old students at 200 randomly selected german schools in the early months of 2003 . while they were able to improve to 17th place in mathematics , the study 's focal point this time around , german students remained substandard in reading and comprehension , ranking 20th , according to the leaked results . immigrants , poor students fall behind the study also revealed a massive disparity in educational performance based on household income .
children of academics , or parents with high incomes were three times as likely to take the abitur , the german college prep school 's final exam .
no other country surveyed showed such a margin of difference . children from immigrant and lower-income families performed far worse in school .
andreas schleicher , the pisa coordinator of the oecd , criticized germany 's three-tier school system for leaving lower-performing children behind . by separating children after the fourth grade into either higher or lower-grade schools , " the weaker students are pushed away instead of individually encouraged , " said schliecher , who would not comment directly on the study in an interview with capital magazine . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

stricter requirements for long distance transport and better training of drivers are also included .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .
their candidate urged them to stay there as he accused outgoing president leonid kuchma and his designated successor , yanukovich , of voter fraud . " remain where you are , " said yuschenko .
" from all parts of ukraine , on carts , cars , planes and trains tens of thousands of people are on their way here .
our action is only beginning . " yanukovich , who has russian president vladimir putin 's approval , dismissed the accusations , and his campaign immediately dismissed the exit polls giving yuschenko the lead as " inaccurate and unscientific . " a landmark election thirteen years after gaining independence from the soviet union , sunday 's runoff election in ukraine is a landmark event that will determine whether this nation of nearly 50 million turns toward europe or remains heavily influenced by moscow . kuchma , stepping down after 10 years of often strong-armed rule over this strategic eastern european country , has warned that there would be " no revolution " after the opposition threatened mass protests . electoral authorities reported a turnout exceeding 76 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian presidential candidate viktor yushchenko yushchenko -lrb- photo -rrb- had vowed to bring his supporters onto the streets yanukovich is declared the winner .
by monday morning , the opposition campaign reported wide-spread election fraud , accusing yankovich of ballot stuffing and allowing supporters to vote twice . there were also reports of an assault on an opposition observer and a local campaign headquarters of yushchenko in eastern ukraine , while a non-government organization said that busloads of people were involved in multiple voting . europe vs. russia the run-up to the vote has left the country deeply divided , with the nationalist ukrainian-speaking west supporting 50-year-old yushchenko while the industrialized russian-speaking east backs 54-year-old yanukovich . it has also created a clash of generations between older people who came of age during the soviet era and feel an affinity with fellow-slav russia , and a new westward-looking youth that wants ukraine to join a modern europe . an armed detachment of police equipped with armored personnel carriers guarded the offices of the election commission in kiev , which was sealed off with temporary metal barriers . yushchenko , accompanied by his five children and american wife , all sporting the opposition 's trademark orange , was upbeat as he voted in kiev midday . fraud allegations " there will be fraud , but the scenario of victory by the government through fraud is utopian , it wo n't happen , " he said as hundreds of people wearing orange ribbons swarmed around shouting " yushchenko !

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .

election observers fear the conflicting results could spark outbreaks of violence in the central asian country that bridges russia and europe . tens of thousands of yuschenko supporters had already gathered in kiev 's independence square overnight .

"
the revelations about jacques barrot , who holds the office of transport commissioner , are the latest in a line of problems that have marred the beginning of the new commission 's five-year term .
barrot 's past was revealed by eurosceptic uk mep nigel farage just minutes before meps voted to approve the commission on thursday .
a spokesman said that barroso has " full confidence " in the commissioner who " has never been accused of personal enrichment . "
barrot was given an eight-month suspended sentence in 2000 .
however , a general amnesty in 1995 by french president jacques chirac meant that the case was wiped from record .
" the activity in which -lrb- barrot -rrb- was involved would disqualify him from holding public office in many eu member states , " said graham watson , leader of the liberals , who urged common rules on the matter .
the new commission will take up office on monday following a turbulent few weeks where italian commission nominee rocco buttiglione was rejected after expressing conservative views on gays and the role of women in society .
latvian commissioner-designate ingrida udre , was also withdrawn after meps raised questions about funding irregularities for her political party .

"
the revelations about jacques barrot , who holds the office of transport commissioner , are the latest in a line of problems that have marred the beginning of the new commission 's five-year term .
barrot 's past was revealed by eurosceptic uk mep nigel farage just minutes before meps voted to approve the commission on thursday .
a spokesman said that barroso has " full confidence " in the commissioner who " has never been accused of personal enrichment . "
barrot was given an eight-month suspended sentence in 2000 .

" the activity in which -lrb- barrot -rrb- was involved would disqualify him from holding public office in many eu member states , " said graham watson , leader of the liberals , who urged common rules on the matter .
the new commission will take up office on monday following a turbulent few weeks where italian commission nominee rocco buttiglione was rejected after expressing conservative views on gays and the role of women in society .
latvian commissioner-designate ingrida udre , was also withdrawn after meps raised questions about funding irregularities for her political party .

the constitutional court ruled that certain parts of the european constitution that " affect the essential conditions for the exercising of national sovereignty " will require a change in the national law before being ratified .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”
rivalries , hitches hinder terror fight hitches in intelligence sharing , and the flow of information between national law enforcement and security agencies on the european level is mirroring similar problems within each country .
german security officials , for example , have been at pains to improve data-sharing since the sept .
11 attacks , with only marginal success , say critics .
“ the police don ’ t know what the police know , ” said bodo franz , the hamburg state police ’ s top terrorism investigator , echoing a common refrain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's law enforcement : each to his own rivalries between germany ’ s three major law enforcement agencies and the complexity of the country ’ s security structure is hampering germany ’ s anti-terrorism efforts , said klaus jansen , head of germany ’ s criminal investigators union .
“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”
the same criticism applies on the european level .
following the madrid attacks a top german justice official complained that spanish police guarded information on the attackers , rather than contact investigators across europe to see how they could have helped .
european union counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries , appointed following the madrid attack , has taken these complaints into account while making moves to remedy the situation .
eu can only do so much in recent months , the eu established a center for intelligence analysis that brings together experts from intelligence and security services .
there is also talk of introducing two biometric identifiers on each european identity card to combat identity fraud , an easy way for terrorists to slink in and out of the eu .
but de vries , in testimony to members of the us congress in september , acknowledged that the powers of his position only went so far .
“ the role of the union is still relatively limited , ” he said .
“ most of the instruments and competences in the fight against terrorism remain in the hands of the member states . ”
going after imams up to now those methods have been varied .
britain and france , countries that have long and violent histories with domestic terrorism , have taken relatively tough approaches in combating islamic fundamentalism .
britain ’ s 2002 anti-terror law made it the only european country to suspend article five of the european convention on human rights which forbids the arbitrary detention of suspects without appearing before a judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers outside the mosque of the caliph state of cologne , whose leader , metin kaplan , was deported to turkey earlier this fall france ’ s strict separation of church and state has enabled prosecutors to crack down much harder on muslim imams railing against the western world in their friday sermons .
early this summer , the country deported several imams whose preachings french prosecutors deemed inflammatory .
germany is now considering a similar crackdown on imams , with bavarian interior minister günter beckstein proposing turning down visas to extremist imams wanting to visit the country .
interior minister otto schily wants to give the federal bureau of criminal investigation more “ preventative ” anti-terror capabilities and set up central register of islamic extremists that would combine the information gleaned by germany ’ s various law enforcment agencies into one databank .
heading towards us-style policies ?
both german and dutch politicians have been calling for a tightening of immigration policies that will make it tougher for foreigners to get in the country and easier to deport foreigers with extremist tendencies .
the proposals may bear resemblance to tough measures taken in the us following the sept .
11 attacks , but experts say any similarities are fleeting .
no one expects european countries to go much further in changing criminal or immigration legislation – yet .
“ i don ’ t think we should change our point of view , we should not make our laws more aggressive , ” franz said .
“ but that may change , depending on a threat or attack . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

fighting terrorism in europe is as varied as the continent 's cultures and legal systems .
and that , say investigators , could become a major problem . at the moment , mamoun darkanzali is sitting in a hamburg jail cell .
but in a few weeks , the syrian-german businessmen will face a spanish judge on charges of recruiting islamic terrorists .
the arrest and pending extradition of darkanzali under a new eu-wide arrest warrant , illustrates the progress europe has made in the period since terrorist attacks in the united states and , most recently , in madrid last march showed europeans the dangerous face of islamic fundamentalism .
now that the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , allegedly by a muslim radical with both dutch and moroccan citizenship , has lent new urgency to europe 's anti-terror fight , investigators are concerned that the continent 's varying approaches to tackling the problem could prove to be a dangerous hindrance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombing at the madrid train station killed 131 people and injuring hundreds more .
“ i think this is a problem for europe , ” said rafael gasso , the chief inspector for the spanish police , and current president of the european council of police unions in an interview .
“ if we don ’ t advance on this as we are in the monetary area , or other areas , we already have problems and we will have problems in the future . ”

“ they gather information , each on their own , and don ’ t compare it to one another , ” said jansen , one of german law enforcement ’ s most persistent critics .
“ they hide behind legal barriers and say , as long as it ’ s not legally approved , it ’ s not possible . ”

they 're among the celebrities who feature in a new glossy advert , featuring a poem written by a victim of bullying .
around one in four primary school children and one in three secondary school children are bullied at some point in their school life , according to official estimates .
this morning , breakfast found out more about the campaign - and what you can do to tackle bullying .
we talked to radio one dj emma b she told us how upset she 'd been when she discovered that a 16 year old who 'd called her sunday surgery programme about bullying had later committed suicide .
we talked to gill frances , of the anti-bullying alliance " there are lots of things we know we can do in schools .
for instance , raising awareness and getting children to talk about bullying - and using peer support , " she told us .
what you told breakfast " i can still feel scared just by walking past some school gates 20 years after i was bullied .
anyone who thinks bullying does n't affect you long term is seriously mistaken . "
marie , wirral schools have found it helpful to train pupils to mediate among themselves and offer counselling to children who are being bullied .
" the reason for the increase in bullying statistics may be because more children are telling people - in the past , some felt that they could n't say anything , " she told us .
the new anti-bullying video , which will be shown on national tv over the next week , features lines from a poem written by a victim of bullying at school .
it was published on the anti-bullying site , bullying.co.uk children will be encouraged to wear a blue wristband - like the one in the photo - as a sign of solidarity .
later this week , the government will publish new guidelines on tackling bullying , particularly homophobic victimisation .
the education secretary charles clarke has already published new guidance on school behaviour , which says that schools should adopt a " zero tolerance " policy on bullying .
getting help if you 're being bullied at school , the first thing to remember is that you 're not alone .
the helpline childline took more than 30,000 calls on bullying last year - a quarter of its total .
it stresses that bullying is not a normal state of affairs - and you should n't have to put up with it .
that 's why the latest campaign encourages everyone to wear a blue wristband : as a sign of solidarity .
on the right hand side of this page , you will find links to organisations which can help .
or , you can ring childline : 0800 111 .
have you witnessed or experienced bullying at school ?
tell us how you handled it - and what worked for you .
name your e-mail address where you live comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .
your comments may be published on any bbc media worldwide .

three quarters of those questioned in the survey for a scottish whisky distiller backed the move .
a similar poll by glenlivet in 2001 showed 68 % support , suggesting growing approval of the idea .
the younger generation showed the greatest enthusiasm among the 1,000 scots who were questioned for the survey , conducted by mori .
the proposal already has the backing of cardinal keith o 'brien , head of the catholic church in scotland .
he believes the country 's patron saint is " taken for granted " .
the survey suggested that scots want to have a day when they can honour st andrew and feel proud of their country .
day of celebration first minister jack mcconnell was urged almost a year ago to take the lead in promoting st andrew 's day .
the call was made by liberal democrat msp donald gorrie who wants 30 november to be celebrated like thanksgiving in the united states .
mr gorrie also tabled a holyrood motion urging the scottish parliament to pursue the matter " vigorously " .
he believed it would attract more visitors to the country .
the msp for central scotland region said he wanted the first minister and the parliament to bring together leading scottish figures to create a framework for a national celebration on which local communities could build .
donald gorrie tabled a motion backing the move he said a national day of celebrations would attract scots from abroad and overseas tourists to visit the country around that date .
it could serve as a focus to promote scotland and scottish products , arts organisations could put on performances by scots past and present , and schools , colleges and sporting organisations could mark the event .
mr gorrie added : " all this would greatly increase scots ' self-awareness and self-belief . "
the scottish national party complained in 2002 that britain 's overseas embassies were not doing enough to celebrate st andrew 's day .
' no plans ' only five out of 67 british diplomatic outposts surveyed by the snp staged any event to mark the day devoted to scotland 's patron saint .
the then party leader john swinney said that , in contrast , ireland held events to mark st patrick 's day at all of its overseas embassies and consulates .
the scottish executive denied the snp claims , insisting that british diplomatic staff worldwide were involved in events to mark st andrew 's day .
but an executive spokesman said : " we have no plans to make st andrew 's day a public holiday .

in june a temporary ban was put on the sale of the macclesfield psalter to the paul getty museum of los angeles .
the national heritage memorial fund has pledged more than £ 800,000 to the fund to help save it for the nation .
the book , found in a private collection in oxfordshire , would be displayed at cambridge 's fitzwilliam museum .
it was unearthed when a family dispute forced the earl of macclesfield to auction off the contents of a library at shirburn castle , his seat in oxfordshire .
the 225-page illuminated 14th century work , previously unknown to scholars , is considered one of the most important of its kind .
the manuscript is thought to have been made in norfolk it was bought in june by the getty museum of los angeles for £ 1,685,000 but arts minister estelle morris deferred its export to give british bidders a chance to raise the money to buy it .
the 170x108mm illuminated manuscript was produced in east anglia , probably at gorleston in norfolk .
it contains 14 miniatures of religious scenes , chiefly from the life of king david .
the miniatures also depict the patron saints of suffolk and gorleston church .
it is believed to come from the same artist as the gorleston psalter , which is housed in the british museum .
a total of £ 1,543,303 has now been raised .
the outstanding £ 180,000 is needed by 10 february 2005 .

it is a joint project between latvia and the world health organisation .
new drug-resistant strains of tb are 100 times more expensive to treat than regular tb , and can often be fatal .
tb patients in eastern europe are 10 times more likely to have a multi-drug-resistant strain of the disease than anywhere else in the world .
chemotherapy normal tb is a global pandemic .
but curing it is cheap and effective .
a six-month course of drugs costs about $ 10 .
that is not the case with new strains of tb which are increasingly resistant to the treatment currently available .
patients must take high-powered antibiotics or even extensive chemotherapy for up to two years .
and if a patient does not get the right drugs , in most cases it is fatal .
the world health organisation says 300,000 people around the world contract multi-drug resistant tb every year .

that is why this centre , which will carry out research and develop a strategy to fight the spread of the disease , is based in latvia .
and there is another reason .
the region has among the highest infection rates for hiv / aids in the world .
people who are hiv positive are more susceptible to all types of tb .

purists claim it is down to policies promoting abstinence , which have been heavily backed by the bush government .
but family planning services argue 88 % of those who make the pledge break the pledge , so it must be down to condoms and safe sex education .
given that the number of under-18s who became pregnant in england and wales rose from 40,966 in 2001 to 41,868 in 2002 , what can the uk learn from the us ?
by 2010 , pregnancy rates in under 18s in england will have to have dropped by 50 % under targets set by the teenage pregnancy strategy .
conception rates in under 16s should also follow a downward trend , the government has said .
how has the us done it ?
an analysis by researchers at the alan guttmacher institute in the us found about a quarter of the decline in teenage pregnancy between 1988 and 1995 was due to more teenagers abstaining from sex .
the message of abstinence is universal and has a universal effect on reducing teenage pregnancies .
matthew staver from liberty counsel how effective are abstinence pledges ?
the remaining three-quarters of the drop resulted from a decrease in pregnancy rates among sexually active teenagers .
this decline was caused by more effective contraceptive use .
but matthew staver , from the conservative us christian group liberty counsel , believes the more recent decline is down to teenagers waiting until they are married before they have sex .
" i think it 's an obvious correlation .
i have always been puzzled why people say abstinence education does not work .
it obviously works .
it 's common sense .
" clearly , youth understand the importance of self respect and prefer that they will be attractive because of who they are and not because of their sexual functions .
" it 's a very encouraging and positive trend to see that abstinence education is working .
" the uk can clearly take a message from what is happening in america . "
he said people who claim abstinence education does not work were ignore reality because they have another agenda - a sexual revolution agenda .
safe sex or no sex ?
melissa dear from the uk family planning association said this was nonsense .
" i can understand that some groups would want to capitalise on this to say abstinence works .
" in the uk , we do not feel that it is a helpful approach .
the average age of marriage is the late 20s .
it 's unrealistic to expect people to abstain from sexual activity until then .
melissa dear from the uk family planning association " there is a big difference between abstinence until marriage programmes and programmes that help young people resist peer press to have sex early .
" abstinence until marriage tells young people that contraception does not work and makes them vulnerable to unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections when they do have sex . "
she said the figures could have been a reflection of a high abortion rate and that the us still had a higher teen pregnancy rate than some countries around the world .
the fpa believes young people should be provided with information about sex and contraception to give them the confidence they need to resist peer pressure to have sex before they are ready , but equip them with the skills and knowledge to have sex safely when they decide to do so .
she said abstinence until marriage might suit certain groups , but that it was not a realistic policy for society as a whole .
" in this country , the average age of marriage is the late 20s .
it 's unrealistic to expect people to abstain from sexual activity until then .
" abstinence programmes are often part of a faith-based initiative which just does not carry as well in the uk .
" it also excludes vast numbers of young people , including those already having sex , lesbian and gay communities and young people who are not entitled to marry . "
mr staver from liberty counsel disagreed , saying : " we all experience the same temptations and struggles .
" the message of abstinence is universal and has a universal effect on reducing teenage pregnancies . "
a study by us researchers at columbia and yale universities of data collected from 12,000 teenagers ages 12 to 18 who were questioned again six years later found nearly nine out of 10 who had made an abstinence pledge went back on it .
belt and braces a british medical association report found six out of 10 uk 16- to 24-year-olds admit to not using condoms , despite repeated government efforts to get the safe-sex message across .

purists claim it is down to policies promoting abstinence , which have been heavily backed by the bush government .
but family planning services argue 88 % of those who make the pledge break the pledge , so it must be down to condoms and safe sex education .
given that the number of under-18s who became pregnant in england and wales rose from 40,966 in 2001 to 41,868 in 2002 , what can the uk learn from the us ?
by 2010 , pregnancy rates in under 18s in england will have to have dropped by 50 % under targets set by the teenage pregnancy strategy .
conception rates in under 16s should also follow a downward trend , the government has said .
how has the us done it ?
an analysis by researchers at the alan guttmacher institute in the us found about a quarter of the decline in teenage pregnancy between 1988 and 1995 was due to more teenagers abstaining from sex .
the message of abstinence is universal and has a universal effect on reducing teenage pregnancies .
matthew staver from liberty counsel how effective are abstinence pledges ?
the remaining three-quarters of the drop resulted from a decrease in pregnancy rates among sexually active teenagers .
this decline was caused by more effective contraceptive use .
but matthew staver , from the conservative us christian group liberty counsel , believes the more recent decline is down to teenagers waiting until they are married before they have sex .
" i think it 's an obvious correlation .
i have always been puzzled why people say abstinence education does not work .
it obviously works .
it 's common sense .
" clearly , youth understand the importance of self respect and prefer that they will be attractive because of who they are and not because of their sexual functions .
" it 's a very encouraging and positive trend to see that abstinence education is working .
" the uk can clearly take a message from what is happening in america . "
he said people who claim abstinence education does not work were ignore reality because they have another agenda - a sexual revolution agenda .
