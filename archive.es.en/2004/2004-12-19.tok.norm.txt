although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .
during the initial campaign and in the aftermath as the country sunk into crisis , yanukovych was the more popular candidate here , as miners and factory workers took to the streets to protest kiev ’ s overturning of the initial election results . click here for more information on ukraine 's geography and history . now with only a week to go before the population returns to the ballot , yuschenko is campaigning hard in the donbass region .
he wants to make sure his message gets out to these people and that they understand he aims to represent their interests as well .
so far the mine workers aren ’ t buying it . the enemy from the west for the majority of the miners in eastern ukraine , pro-western yushchenko is an enemy .
he was the country ’ s prime minister in the 1990s when the industrialized donbass region was shaken by a severe economic crisis . " at the time the miners would go down the mine with empty stomachs .
this only changed when yanukovych came to power , " said sascha , a young coal worker , who traveled to kiev to demonstrate for his favorite candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych during a meeting in donetsk , an industrial city in eastern ukraine as prime minister , yanukovych made sure that coal mining was subsidized and prevented the mines from closing and thousands of people losing their jobs .
he is virtually a hero in the east . " since then we ’ ve had stability here .
you can ask anyone in the region .
pensioners are able to take out loans and buy themselves tv-sets and refrigerators .
but now this stability is at stake again because of this orange revolution , " sascha lamented . anatoli gungarov , director of the gaegova mine , which only seven years ago faced imminent closure , praises yanukovych , who personally intervened to save the mine .
gungarov now worries about the future of mining if yushchenko wins . " it is possible to have a mine shaft working profitably .
the government , the state , just has to fix the prices , " he said .
" it would be a crime to kill the goose just because it is not laying any more golden eggs .

sascha and his friends are so thoroughly behind yanokovych that they went to kiev to wave blue flags in the middle of orange-waving yuschenko supporters .
they knew they would be in the minority , but they felt it was important to show their views . " i met the opposition .
they have slogans like ' miners you are being lied to ' and i asked them : ' sorry , what do you mean ' , " he said .
" it was my own decision to go to kiev ; i wasn ’ t forced or paid for it .
you have to be aware of the difference between truth and propaganda . " sascha , like others in pro-russian east ukraine , believe the yuschenko supporters are financed by the west .
they say the opposition received money for all the orange-colored propaganda , the oranges and tangerines .
they say the " orange mob " will eventually disappear once the money runs out and the capital kiev will be clean again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , left , and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych shake hands after talks in kiev , wednesday , dec .

the anger of the miners is being fuelled by the propaganda of the regional media , which report that if elected , yushchenko will close down the mines .
the local press also claims that the opposition candidate , who speaks ukrainian , wants to force the national language on the region where russian dominates . in the gaegova mine , the outcome of the election is clear .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .

in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .
the waiting line for adoptions in germany is much longer than that of available children - the ratio is about 20:1 . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's best " pr campaign " the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .

the traditional music sector is still struggling to reach young listeners . “ if it were up to me , we would broadcast an opera twice a week during prime time , ” said the programming director of germany ’ s largest private television station at a media conference in berlin two years ago .

but the increase in sales owes largely to a few shining stars in the business .
the traditional music sector is still struggling to reach young listeners . “ if it were up to me , we would broadcast an opera twice a week during prime time , ” said the programming director of germany ’ s largest private television station at a media conference in berlin two years ago .

the bundesbank has “ the right to sell 120 tons of gold , which would bring about € 8 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- , ” eichel was quoted in the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
“ we should think about it .
gold does not earn interest , but the money obtained from its sale certainly does , ” the minister said to critics that a sale would deplete the country ’ s reserves .
debate has been underway in germany for the past several months about selling off part of the gold reserves in order to finance education and research projects .
according to german law , the decision to sell off the gold rests with the central bank , but current legislation dictates that profits from the sale go to the federal budget .
the bundesbank said on dec .
7 that a decision on any sale would be announced before the end of the year .
after the us , germany has the second largest gold reserves in the world – 3,400 tons .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?
now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country .

the bundesbank has “ the right to sell 120 tons of gold , which would bring about € 8 billion -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- , ” eichel was quoted in the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
“ we should think about it .
gold does not earn interest , but the money obtained from its sale certainly does , ” the minister said to critics that a sale would deplete the country ’ s reserves .
debate has been underway in germany for the past several months about selling off part of the gold reserves in order to finance education and research projects .
according to german law , the decision to sell off the gold rests with the central bank , but current legislation dictates that profits from the sale go to the federal budget .
the bundesbank said on dec .
7 that a decision on any sale would be announced before the end of the year .
after the us , germany has the second largest gold reserves in the world – 3,400 tons .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?
now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country .

but the increase in sales owes largely to a few shining stars in the business .
the traditional music sector is still struggling to reach young listeners . “ if it were up to me , we would broadcast an opera twice a week during prime time , ” said the programming director of germany ’ s largest private television station at a media conference in berlin two years ago .
why that never took place and why classical music is still only shown on specialty stations , was clear right away . “ unfortunately , no one is interested in it .
we would have less than one percent viewer ratings , ” he said . in december 2004 , the opera singer anna netrebko proved that classic music could be popular when she reached out to some 14 million germans or 47 percent of the viewing audience during a prime time appearance on public broadcaster zdf ’ s entertainment show “ wetten , dass … ? ”
-lrb- bet that ... -rrb- .
of course , the majority of her viewers probably tuned in to see the follow-up acts by the other guests robbie williams and kylie minogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna netrebko charmed talk show host thomas gottshalk with her voice and stunning appearance nonetheless , when the russian soprano sang an aria from “ gianni schicchi ” a cross-section of the german public was listening and watching .
after her performance when the opera diva was overwhelmed with compliments for her beautiful voice from the show ’ s host and british pop star robbie williams , people - particularly non-opera buffs - took notice . stars boost sales the example of netrebko ’ s rise in popularity is typical of the current trend in classical music and opera . in the first three months of 2004 , album sales for classical music rose by 2.3 percent , according to the german recording industry association ifpi .
largely responsible for the increase are stars like netrebko or the chinese “ wunderpianist ” lang lang , who attracted over a million television viewers when he appeared on zdf to receive a “ classic echo ” award . but , such statistics deceive .
when compared to sales in the record industry as a whole , classic music is a “ special interest . ”
in 2003 , the segment accounted for only 7.1 percent of overall sales .
more than half of all music sold was purchased by customers over 50 .
listeners under 30 make up just five percent of all classical music fans . outdated music ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical music is n't very hip among young people the phenomena is one concert organizers see first-hand as fewer and fewer young people buy tickets for classical performances .
the “ youth culture barometer 2004 ” which measures trends in the younger generation examined the popularity of classical music among listeners between 14 and 25 .
only eight percent of them frequently went to classical concerts and six percent went to the opera . the primary reason for the lack of interest is the way the performances take place , said the director of the center for culture research , andreas wiesand .
“ classical concerts just aren ’ t very motivating .
younger people want something more informal .
they ’ re not willing to sit sill for three hours , ” he said . according to the culture expert , it ’ s a generational problem .
“ a lot more could be done to make the performances interesting , ” wiesand said with a view to simon rattle , the popular director of the berlin philharmonic . generating youth interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle conducts the berlin philharmonic orchestra rattle , who has taken berlin and the music world by storm with his non-traditional methods and approaches to attracting new audience , was recently honoured with the comenius prize for his efforts to introduce classical music to youths . since 2002 rattle has headed up the education program of the philharmonic and taken his orchestra into the schools to teach music .
the professional musicians practice their current repertoire with the students and even allow some of them to perform with the world-class ensemble on stage . in addition to the education program , rattle has also introduced a youth discount ticket , which allows young people to visit various berlin concert houses for just € 6 -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- , thereby reducing the financial barrier to classical music and opera . the efforts paid off during the summer when some 22,000 people , including hundreds of younger classical music fans , turned out for the philharmonic ’ s open-air concert .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .
the waiting line for adoptions in germany is much longer than that of available children - the ratio is about 20:1 . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's best " pr campaign " the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .

but the increase in sales owes largely to a few shining stars in the business .
the traditional music sector is still struggling to reach young listeners . “ if it were up to me , we would broadcast an opera twice a week during prime time , ” said the programming director of germany ’ s largest private television station at a media conference in berlin two years ago .
why that never took place and why classical music is still only shown on specialty stations , was clear right away . “ unfortunately , no one is interested in it .
we would have less than one percent viewer ratings , ” he said . in december 2004 , the opera singer anna netrebko proved that classic music could be popular when she reached out to some 14 million germans or 47 percent of the viewing audience during a prime time appearance on public broadcaster zdf ’ s entertainment show “ wetten , dass … ? ”
-lrb- bet that ... -rrb- .
of course , the majority of her viewers probably tuned in to see the follow-up acts by the other guests robbie williams and kylie minogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna netrebko charmed talk show host thomas gottshalk with her voice and stunning appearance nonetheless , when the russian soprano sang an aria from “ gianni schicchi ” a cross-section of the german public was listening and watching .
after her performance when the opera diva was overwhelmed with compliments for her beautiful voice from the show ’ s host and british pop star robbie williams , people - particularly non-opera buffs - took notice . stars boost sales the example of netrebko ’ s rise in popularity is typical of the current trend in classical music and opera . in the first three months of 2004 , album sales for classical music rose by 2.3 percent , according to the german recording industry association ifpi .
largely responsible for the increase are stars like netrebko or the chinese “ wunderpianist ” lang lang , who attracted over a million television viewers when he appeared on zdf to receive a “ classic echo ” award . but , such statistics deceive .
when compared to sales in the record industry as a whole , classic music is a “ special interest . ”
in 2003 , the segment accounted for only 7.1 percent of overall sales .
more than half of all music sold was purchased by customers over 50 .
listeners under 30 make up just five percent of all classical music fans . outdated music ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical music is n't very hip among young people the phenomena is one concert organizers see first-hand as fewer and fewer young people buy tickets for classical performances .
the “ youth culture barometer 2004 ” which measures trends in the younger generation examined the popularity of classical music among listeners between 14 and 25 .
only eight percent of them frequently went to classical concerts and six percent went to the opera . the primary reason for the lack of interest is the way the performances take place , said the director of the center for culture research , andreas wiesand .
“ classical concerts just aren ’ t very motivating .
younger people want something more informal .
they ’ re not willing to sit sill for three hours , ” he said . according to the culture expert , it ’ s a generational problem .
“ a lot more could be done to make the performances interesting , ” wiesand said with a view to simon rattle , the popular director of the berlin philharmonic . generating youth interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle conducts the berlin philharmonic orchestra rattle , who has taken berlin and the music world by storm with his non-traditional methods and approaches to attracting new audience , was recently honoured with the comenius prize for his efforts to introduce classical music to youths . since 2002 rattle has headed up the education program of the philharmonic and taken his orchestra into the schools to teach music .
the professional musicians practice their current repertoire with the students and even allow some of them to perform with the world-class ensemble on stage . in addition to the education program , rattle has also introduced a youth discount ticket , which allows young people to visit various berlin concert houses for just € 6 -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- , thereby reducing the financial barrier to classical music and opera . the efforts paid off during the summer when some 22,000 people , including hundreds of younger classical music fans , turned out for the philharmonic ’ s open-air concert .

although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .
the waiting line for adoptions in germany is much longer than that of available children - the ratio is about 20:1 . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's best " pr campaign " the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .
the waiting line for adoptions in germany is much longer than that of available children - the ratio is about 20:1 . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's best " pr campaign " the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .

but the increase in sales owes largely to a few shining stars in the business .
the traditional music sector is still struggling to reach young listeners . “ if it were up to me , we would broadcast an opera twice a week during prime time , ” said the programming director of germany ’ s largest private television station at a media conference in berlin two years ago .
why that never took place and why classical music is still only shown on specialty stations , was clear right away . “ unfortunately , no one is interested in it .
we would have less than one percent viewer ratings , ” he said . in december 2004 , the opera singer anna netrebko proved that classic music could be popular when she reached out to some 14 million germans or 47 percent of the viewing audience during a prime time appearance on public broadcaster zdf ’ s entertainment show “ wetten , dass … ? ”

of course , the majority of her viewers probably tuned in to see the follow-up acts by the other guests robbie williams and kylie minogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna netrebko charmed talk show host thomas gottshalk with her voice and stunning appearance nonetheless , when the russian soprano sang an aria from “ gianni schicchi ” a cross-section of the german public was listening and watching .
after her performance when the opera diva was overwhelmed with compliments for her beautiful voice from the show ’ s host and british pop star robbie williams , people - particularly non-opera buffs - took notice . stars boost sales the example of netrebko ’ s rise in popularity is typical of the current trend in classical music and opera . in the first three months of 2004 , album sales for classical music rose by 2.3 percent , according to the german recording industry association ifpi .
largely responsible for the increase are stars like netrebko or the chinese “ wunderpianist ” lang lang , who attracted over a million television viewers when he appeared on zdf to receive a “ classic echo ” award . but , such statistics deceive .
when compared to sales in the record industry as a whole , classic music is a “ special interest . ”
in 2003 , the segment accounted for only 7.1 percent of overall sales .
more than half of all music sold was purchased by customers over 50 .
listeners under 30 make up just five percent of all classical music fans . outdated music ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical music is n't very hip among young people the phenomena is one concert organizers see first-hand as fewer and fewer young people buy tickets for classical performances .
the “ youth culture barometer 2004 ” which measures trends in the younger generation examined the popularity of classical music among listeners between 14 and 25 .
only eight percent of them frequently went to classical concerts and six percent went to the opera . the primary reason for the lack of interest is the way the performances take place , said the director of the center for culture research , andreas wiesand .
“ classical concerts just aren ’ t very motivating .
younger people want something more informal .
they ’ re not willing to sit sill for three hours , ” he said . according to the culture expert , it ’ s a generational problem .
“ a lot more could be done to make the performances interesting , ” wiesand said with a view to simon rattle , the popular director of the berlin philharmonic . generating youth interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle conducts the berlin philharmonic orchestra rattle , who has taken berlin and the music world by storm with his non-traditional methods and approaches to attracting new audience , was recently honoured with the comenius prize for his efforts to introduce classical music to youths . since 2002 rattle has headed up the education program of the philharmonic and taken his orchestra into the schools to teach music .
the professional musicians practice their current repertoire with the students and even allow some of them to perform with the world-class ensemble on stage . in addition to the education program , rattle has also introduced a youth discount ticket , which allows young people to visit various berlin concert houses for just € 6 -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- , thereby reducing the financial barrier to classical music and opera . the efforts paid off during the summer when some 22,000 people , including hundreds of younger classical music fans , turned out for the philharmonic ’ s open-air concert .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .
the waiting line for adoptions in germany is much longer than that of available children - the ratio is about 20:1 . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's best " pr campaign " the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .

although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .

they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .

that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 19.12.2004 ukraine divided over election rerun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in ukraine waves orange flags for the opposition since ukraine ’ s supreme court decided to repeat the presidential vote , opposition candidate viktor yushchenko has focused his efforts on the country ’ s east , which stubbornly sticks to prime minister viktor yanukovych . in the run-up to next sunday ’ s restaging of the presidential elections , the widely popular yushchenko has spent a great deal of time traveling through the mostly russian speaking eastern part of ukraine .
although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .
during the initial campaign and in the aftermath as the country sunk into crisis , yanukovych was the more popular candidate here , as miners and factory workers took to the streets to protest kiev ’ s overturning of the initial election results . click here for more information on ukraine 's geography and history . now with only a week to go before the population returns to the ballot , yuschenko is campaigning hard in the donbass region .
he wants to make sure his message gets out to these people and that they understand he aims to represent their interests as well .
so far the mine workers aren ’ t buying it . the enemy from the west for the majority of the miners in eastern ukraine , pro-western yushchenko is an enemy .
he was the country ’ s prime minister in the 1990s when the industrialized donbass region was shaken by a severe economic crisis . " at the time the miners would go down the mine with empty stomachs .
this only changed when yanukovych came to power , " said sascha , a young coal worker , who traveled to kiev to demonstrate for his favorite candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych during a meeting in donetsk , an industrial city in eastern ukraine as prime minister , yanukovych made sure that coal mining was subsidized and prevented the mines from closing and thousands of people losing their jobs .
he is virtually a hero in the east . " since then we ’ ve had stability here .
you can ask anyone in the region .
pensioners are able to take out loans and buy themselves tv-sets and refrigerators .
but now this stability is at stake again because of this orange revolution , " sascha lamented . anatoli gungarov , director of the gaegova mine , which only seven years ago faced imminent closure , praises yanukovych , who personally intervened to save the mine .
gungarov now worries about the future of mining if yushchenko wins . " it is possible to have a mine shaft working profitably .
the government , the state , just has to fix the prices , " he said .
" it would be a crime to kill the goose just because it is not laying any more golden eggs .
that would be the end of the mines . " a question of propaganda and survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
sascha and his friends are so thoroughly behind yanokovych that they went to kiev to wave blue flags in the middle of orange-waving yuschenko supporters .
they knew they would be in the minority , but they felt it was important to show their views . " i met the opposition .
they have slogans like ' miners you are being lied to ' and i asked them : ' sorry , what do you mean ' , " he said .
" it was my own decision to go to kiev ; i wasn ’ t forced or paid for it .
you have to be aware of the difference between truth and propaganda . " sascha , like others in pro-russian east ukraine , believe the yuschenko supporters are financed by the west .
they say the opposition received money for all the orange-colored propaganda , the oranges and tangerines .
they say the " orange mob " will eventually disappear once the money runs out and the capital kiev will be clean again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , left , and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych shake hands after talks in kiev , wednesday , dec .
1 , 2004 .
the anger of the miners is being fuelled by the propaganda of the regional media , which report that if elected , yushchenko will close down the mines .
the local press also claims that the opposition candidate , who speaks ukrainian , wants to force the national language on the region where russian dominates . in the gaegova mine , the outcome of the election is clear .
" if yanukovych is elected , we will live , " the miners chanted .
" if yushchenko comes to power , we can pack up and go .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .
the waiting line for adoptions in germany is much longer than that of available children - the ratio is about 20:1 . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's best " pr campaign " the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 19.12.2004 ukraine divided over election rerun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in ukraine waves orange flags for the opposition since ukraine ’ s supreme court decided to repeat the presidential vote , opposition candidate viktor yushchenko has focused his efforts on the country ’ s east , which stubbornly sticks to prime minister viktor yanukovych . in the run-up to next sunday ’ s restaging of the presidential elections , the widely popular yushchenko has spent a great deal of time traveling through the mostly russian speaking eastern part of ukraine .
although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .
during the initial campaign and in the aftermath as the country sunk into crisis , yanukovych was the more popular candidate here , as miners and factory workers took to the streets to protest kiev ’ s overturning of the initial election results . click here for more information on ukraine 's geography and history . now with only a week to go before the population returns to the ballot , yuschenko is campaigning hard in the donbass region .
he wants to make sure his message gets out to these people and that they understand he aims to represent their interests as well .
so far the mine workers aren ’ t buying it . the enemy from the west for the majority of the miners in eastern ukraine , pro-western yushchenko is an enemy .
he was the country ’ s prime minister in the 1990s when the industrialized donbass region was shaken by a severe economic crisis . " at the time the miners would go down the mine with empty stomachs .
this only changed when yanukovych came to power , " said sascha , a young coal worker , who traveled to kiev to demonstrate for his favorite candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych during a meeting in donetsk , an industrial city in eastern ukraine as prime minister , yanukovych made sure that coal mining was subsidized and prevented the mines from closing and thousands of people losing their jobs .
he is virtually a hero in the east . " since then we ’ ve had stability here .
you can ask anyone in the region .
pensioners are able to take out loans and buy themselves tv-sets and refrigerators .
but now this stability is at stake again because of this orange revolution , " sascha lamented . anatoli gungarov , director of the gaegova mine , which only seven years ago faced imminent closure , praises yanukovych , who personally intervened to save the mine .
gungarov now worries about the future of mining if yushchenko wins . " it is possible to have a mine shaft working profitably .
the government , the state , just has to fix the prices , " he said .
" it would be a crime to kill the goose just because it is not laying any more golden eggs .
that would be the end of the mines . " a question of propaganda and survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
sascha and his friends are so thoroughly behind yanokovych that they went to kiev to wave blue flags in the middle of orange-waving yuschenko supporters .
they knew they would be in the minority , but they felt it was important to show their views . " i met the opposition .
they have slogans like ' miners you are being lied to ' and i asked them : ' sorry , what do you mean ' , " he said .
" it was my own decision to go to kiev ; i wasn ’ t forced or paid for it .
you have to be aware of the difference between truth and propaganda . " sascha , like others in pro-russian east ukraine , believe the yuschenko supporters are financed by the west .
they say the opposition received money for all the orange-colored propaganda , the oranges and tangerines .
they say the " orange mob " will eventually disappear once the money runs out and the capital kiev will be clean again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , left , and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych shake hands after talks in kiev , wednesday , dec .
1 , 2004 .
the anger of the miners is being fuelled by the propaganda of the regional media , which report that if elected , yushchenko will close down the mines .
the local press also claims that the opposition candidate , who speaks ukrainian , wants to force the national language on the region where russian dominates . in the gaegova mine , the outcome of the election is clear .
" if yanukovych is elected , we will live , " the miners chanted .
" if yushchenko comes to power , we can pack up and go .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 19.12.2004 ukraine divided over election rerun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in ukraine waves orange flags for the opposition since ukraine ’ s supreme court decided to repeat the presidential vote , opposition candidate viktor yushchenko has focused his efforts on the country ’ s east , which stubbornly sticks to prime minister viktor yanukovych . in the run-up to next sunday ’ s restaging of the presidential elections , the widely popular yushchenko has spent a great deal of time traveling through the mostly russian speaking eastern part of ukraine .
although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .
during the initial campaign and in the aftermath as the country sunk into crisis , yanukovych was the more popular candidate here , as miners and factory workers took to the streets to protest kiev ’ s overturning of the initial election results . click here for more information on ukraine 's geography and history . now with only a week to go before the population returns to the ballot , yuschenko is campaigning hard in the donbass region .
he wants to make sure his message gets out to these people and that they understand he aims to represent their interests as well .
so far the mine workers aren ’ t buying it . the enemy from the west for the majority of the miners in eastern ukraine , pro-western yushchenko is an enemy .
he was the country ’ s prime minister in the 1990s when the industrialized donbass region was shaken by a severe economic crisis . " at the time the miners would go down the mine with empty stomachs .
this only changed when yanukovych came to power , " said sascha , a young coal worker , who traveled to kiev to demonstrate for his favorite candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych during a meeting in donetsk , an industrial city in eastern ukraine as prime minister , yanukovych made sure that coal mining was subsidized and prevented the mines from closing and thousands of people losing their jobs .
he is virtually a hero in the east . " since then we ’ ve had stability here .
you can ask anyone in the region .
pensioners are able to take out loans and buy themselves tv-sets and refrigerators .
but now this stability is at stake again because of this orange revolution , " sascha lamented . anatoli gungarov , director of the gaegova mine , which only seven years ago faced imminent closure , praises yanukovych , who personally intervened to save the mine .
gungarov now worries about the future of mining if yushchenko wins . " it is possible to have a mine shaft working profitably .
the government , the state , just has to fix the prices , " he said .
" it would be a crime to kill the goose just because it is not laying any more golden eggs .
that would be the end of the mines . " a question of propaganda and survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
sascha and his friends are so thoroughly behind yanokovych that they went to kiev to wave blue flags in the middle of orange-waving yuschenko supporters .
they knew they would be in the minority , but they felt it was important to show their views . " i met the opposition .
they have slogans like ' miners you are being lied to ' and i asked them : ' sorry , what do you mean ' , " he said .
" it was my own decision to go to kiev ; i wasn ’ t forced or paid for it .
you have to be aware of the difference between truth and propaganda . " sascha , like others in pro-russian east ukraine , believe the yuschenko supporters are financed by the west .
they say the opposition received money for all the orange-colored propaganda , the oranges and tangerines .
they say the " orange mob " will eventually disappear once the money runs out and the capital kiev will be clean again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , left , and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych shake hands after talks in kiev , wednesday , dec .
1 , 2004 .
the anger of the miners is being fuelled by the propaganda of the regional media , which report that if elected , yushchenko will close down the mines .
the local press also claims that the opposition candidate , who speaks ukrainian , wants to force the national language on the region where russian dominates . in the gaegova mine , the outcome of the election is clear .
" if yanukovych is elected , we will live , " the miners chanted .
" if yushchenko comes to power , we can pack up and go .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .

if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .
ideally , the new mom and dad are n't supposed to be more than 40 years older than the child .
that might be about to change , if germany 's minister for family affairs renate schmidt has her way . give older parents a chance to adopt a child , too , renate schmidt has urged germany 's federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sos family : we 're looking old without children " is the title of a book written by schmidt the family minister believes the country 's 16 states should take a close look at the country 's demographic development .
in a country where the population is growing increasingly older , there should n't only be young parents , she said , adding that many women start families late nowadays as they want to pursue their careers first . ines kurek-bender of germany 's federal association for adoptive families said the parents ' age should n't be the determining factor anyway . mirroring society " society 's development must be mirrored in adoptive families , " she said , adding that those responsible already do their best to match parents and children without putting age first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris schröder-köpf schmidt is backed by german chancellor gerhard schröder , 60 , who himself recently adopted a three-year-old russian girl with his 41-year-old wife .
if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .
the waiting line for adoptions in germany is much longer than that of available children - the ratio is about 20:1 . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's best " pr campaign " the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 19.12.2004 ukraine divided over election rerun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in ukraine waves orange flags for the opposition since ukraine ’ s supreme court decided to repeat the presidential vote , opposition candidate viktor yushchenko has focused his efforts on the country ’ s east , which stubbornly sticks to prime minister viktor yanukovych . in the run-up to next sunday ’ s restaging of the presidential elections , the widely popular yushchenko has spent a great deal of time traveling through the mostly russian speaking eastern part of ukraine .
although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .
during the initial campaign and in the aftermath as the country sunk into crisis , yanukovych was the more popular candidate here , as miners and factory workers took to the streets to protest kiev ’ s overturning of the initial election results . click here for more information on ukraine 's geography and history . now with only a week to go before the population returns to the ballot , yuschenko is campaigning hard in the donbass region .
he wants to make sure his message gets out to these people and that they understand he aims to represent their interests as well .
so far the mine workers aren ’ t buying it . the enemy from the west for the majority of the miners in eastern ukraine , pro-western yushchenko is an enemy .
he was the country ’ s prime minister in the 1990s when the industrialized donbass region was shaken by a severe economic crisis . " at the time the miners would go down the mine with empty stomachs .
this only changed when yanukovych came to power , " said sascha , a young coal worker , who traveled to kiev to demonstrate for his favorite candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of ukrainian prime minister viktor yanukovych during a meeting in donetsk , an industrial city in eastern ukraine as prime minister , yanukovych made sure that coal mining was subsidized and prevented the mines from closing and thousands of people losing their jobs .
he is virtually a hero in the east . " since then we ’ ve had stability here .
you can ask anyone in the region .
pensioners are able to take out loans and buy themselves tv-sets and refrigerators .
but now this stability is at stake again because of this orange revolution , " sascha lamented . anatoli gungarov , director of the gaegova mine , which only seven years ago faced imminent closure , praises yanukovych , who personally intervened to save the mine .
gungarov now worries about the future of mining if yushchenko wins . " it is possible to have a mine shaft working profitably .
the government , the state , just has to fix the prices , " he said .
" it would be a crime to kill the goose just because it is not laying any more golden eggs .
that would be the end of the mines . " a question of propaganda and survival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
sascha and his friends are so thoroughly behind yanokovych that they went to kiev to wave blue flags in the middle of orange-waving yuschenko supporters .
they knew they would be in the minority , but they felt it was important to show their views . " i met the opposition .
they have slogans like ' miners you are being lied to ' and i asked them : ' sorry , what do you mean ' , " he said .
" it was my own decision to go to kiev ; i wasn ’ t forced or paid for it .
you have to be aware of the difference between truth and propaganda . " sascha , like others in pro-russian east ukraine , believe the yuschenko supporters are financed by the west .
they say the opposition received money for all the orange-colored propaganda , the oranges and tangerines .
they say the " orange mob " will eventually disappear once the money runs out and the capital kiev will be clean again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , left , and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych shake hands after talks in kiev , wednesday , dec .
1 , 2004 .
the anger of the miners is being fuelled by the propaganda of the regional media , which report that if elected , yushchenko will close down the mines .

but the increase in sales owes largely to a few shining stars in the business .
the traditional music sector is still struggling to reach young listeners . “ if it were up to me , we would broadcast an opera twice a week during prime time , ” said the programming director of germany ’ s largest private television station at a media conference in berlin two years ago .
why that never took place and why classical music is still only shown on specialty stations , was clear right away . “ unfortunately , no one is interested in it .
we would have less than one percent viewer ratings , ” he said . in december 2004 , the opera singer anna netrebko proved that classic music could be popular when she reached out to some 14 million germans or 47 percent of the viewing audience during a prime time appearance on public broadcaster zdf ’ s entertainment show “ wetten , dass … ? ”
-lrb- bet that ... -rrb- .
of course , the majority of her viewers probably tuned in to see the follow-up acts by the other guests robbie williams and kylie minogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna netrebko charmed talk show host thomas gottshalk with her voice and stunning appearance nonetheless , when the russian soprano sang an aria from “ gianni schicchi ” a cross-section of the german public was listening and watching .
after her performance when the opera diva was overwhelmed with compliments for her beautiful voice from the show ’ s host and british pop star robbie williams , people - particularly non-opera buffs - took notice . stars boost sales the example of netrebko ’ s rise in popularity is typical of the current trend in classical music and opera . in the first three months of 2004 , album sales for classical music rose by 2.3 percent , according to the german recording industry association ifpi .
largely responsible for the increase are stars like netrebko or the chinese “ wunderpianist ” lang lang , who attracted over a million television viewers when he appeared on zdf to receive a “ classic echo ” award . but , such statistics deceive .
when compared to sales in the record industry as a whole , classic music is a “ special interest . ”
in 2003 , the segment accounted for only 7.1 percent of overall sales .
more than half of all music sold was purchased by customers over 50 .
listeners under 30 make up just five percent of all classical music fans . outdated music ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical music is n't very hip among young people the phenomena is one concert organizers see first-hand as fewer and fewer young people buy tickets for classical performances .
the “ youth culture barometer 2004 ” which measures trends in the younger generation examined the popularity of classical music among listeners between 14 and 25 .
only eight percent of them frequently went to classical concerts and six percent went to the opera . the primary reason for the lack of interest is the way the performances take place , said the director of the center for culture research , andreas wiesand .
“ classical concerts just aren ’ t very motivating .
younger people want something more informal .
they ’ re not willing to sit sill for three hours , ” he said . according to the culture expert , it ’ s a generational problem .
“ a lot more could be done to make the performances interesting , ” wiesand said with a view to simon rattle , the popular director of the berlin philharmonic . generating youth interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle conducts the berlin philharmonic orchestra rattle , who has taken berlin and the music world by storm with his non-traditional methods and approaches to attracting new audience , was recently honoured with the comenius prize for his efforts to introduce classical music to youths . since 2002 rattle has headed up the education program of the philharmonic and taken his orchestra into the schools to teach music .
the professional musicians practice their current repertoire with the students and even allow some of them to perform with the world-class ensemble on stage . in addition to the education program , rattle has also introduced a youth discount ticket , which allows young people to visit various berlin concert houses for just € 6 -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- , thereby reducing the financial barrier to classical music and opera . the efforts paid off during the summer when some 22,000 people , including hundreds of younger classical music fans , turned out for the philharmonic ’ s open-air concert .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .
a couple 's age is just one of the hurdles that prevents potentially good parents from adopting a child .

if you have a place in your heart and a place at home , you should consider adopting a child , too , the chancellor told germans at the time , responding to criticism that he and his wife doris got special treatment from the adoption agencies to overlook the age factor . so far , the decision over who can and who can not adopt a child is up to the youth welfare departments .
they say , the difference in ages should not be more than 40 years .
that means if a parent is 45 , the child adopted will have to be at least five . but schmidt is apparently trying to push that age limit even further , although it is not clear yet what practical results this would have .

although he is generally favored to win the election , his opponent , kremlin-backed yanukovych , has a loyal following among the miners in the eastern coal region of donbass . half of the country ’ s 48 million population lives in the industrial east , where russia still exerts a strong influence on the politics and economy and many regard the “ orange revolution ” in kiev with a good deal of skepticism .

gungarov now worries about the future of mining if yushchenko wins . " it is possible to have a mine shaft working profitably .

they have slogans like ' miners you are being lied to ' and i asked them : ' sorry , what do you mean ' , " he said .
" it was my own decision to go to kiev ; i wasn ’ t forced or paid for it .
you have to be aware of the difference between truth and propaganda . " sascha , like others in pro-russian east ukraine , believe the yuschenko supporters are financed by the west .

the anger of the miners is being fuelled by the propaganda of the regional media , which report that if elected , yushchenko will close down the mines .
the local press also claims that the opposition candidate , who speaks ukrainian , wants to force the national language on the region where russian dominates . in the gaegova mine , the outcome of the election is clear .

but now this stability is at stake again because of this orange revolution , " sascha lamented . anatoli gungarov , director of the gaegova mine , which only seven years ago faced imminent closure , praises yanukovych , who personally intervened to save the mine .
gungarov now worries about the future of mining if yushchenko wins . " it is possible to have a mine shaft working profitably .
the government , the state , just has to fix the prices , " he said .
" it would be a crime to kill the goose just because it is not laying any more golden eggs .

sascha and his friends are so thoroughly behind yanokovych that they went to kiev to wave blue flags in the middle of orange-waving yuschenko supporters .
they knew they would be in the minority , but they felt it was important to show their views . " i met the opposition .
they have slogans like ' miners you are being lied to ' and i asked them : ' sorry , what do you mean ' , " he said .
" it was my own decision to go to kiev ; i wasn ’ t forced or paid for it .
you have to be aware of the difference between truth and propaganda . " sascha , like others in pro-russian east ukraine , believe the yuschenko supporters are financed by the west .
they say the opposition received money for all the orange-colored propaganda , the oranges and tangerines .
they say the " orange mob " will eventually disappear once the money runs out and the capital kiev will be clean again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's opposition leader viktor yushchenko , left , and pro-moscow presidential candidate viktor yanukovych shake hands after talks in kiev , wednesday , dec .

the anger of the miners is being fuelled by the propaganda of the regional media , which report that if elected , yushchenko will close down the mines .
the local press also claims that the opposition candidate , who speaks ukrainian , wants to force the national language on the region where russian dominates . in the gaegova mine , the outcome of the election is clear .

faced with an ageing population and a rapidly declining birth rate , the german government wants to encourage older people to adopt children . adopting a child is not easy - it 's highly emotional - and in germany , it 's also frought with bureaucracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.12.2004 new classic fans wanted großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sex sells " is a good rule for opera singers , as anna netrebko shows opera and classical music are selling better as the year ends .
but the increase in sales owes largely to a few shining stars in the business .
the traditional music sector is still struggling to reach young listeners . “ if it were up to me , we would broadcast an opera twice a week during prime time , ” said the programming director of germany ’ s largest private television station at a media conference in berlin two years ago .
why that never took place and why classical music is still only shown on specialty stations , was clear right away . “ unfortunately , no one is interested in it .
we would have less than one percent viewer ratings , ” he said . in december 2004 , the opera singer anna netrebko proved that classic music could be popular when she reached out to some 14 million germans or 47 percent of the viewing audience during a prime time appearance on public broadcaster zdf ’ s entertainment show “ wetten , dass … ? ”
-lrb- bet that ... -rrb- .
of course , the majority of her viewers probably tuned in to see the follow-up acts by the other guests robbie williams and kylie minogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna netrebko charmed talk show host thomas gottshalk with her voice and stunning appearance nonetheless , when the russian soprano sang an aria from “ gianni schicchi ” a cross-section of the german public was listening and watching .
after her performance when the opera diva was overwhelmed with compliments for her beautiful voice from the show ’ s host and british pop star robbie williams , people - particularly non-opera buffs - took notice . stars boost sales the example of netrebko ’ s rise in popularity is typical of the current trend in classical music and opera . in the first three months of 2004 , album sales for classical music rose by 2.3 percent , according to the german recording industry association ifpi .
largely responsible for the increase are stars like netrebko or the chinese “ wunderpianist ” lang lang , who attracted over a million television viewers when he appeared on zdf to receive a “ classic echo ” award . but , such statistics deceive .
when compared to sales in the record industry as a whole , classic music is a “ special interest . ”
in 2003 , the segment accounted for only 7.1 percent of overall sales .
more than half of all music sold was purchased by customers over 50 .
listeners under 30 make up just five percent of all classical music fans . outdated music ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : classical music is n't very hip among young people the phenomena is one concert organizers see first-hand as fewer and fewer young people buy tickets for classical performances .
the “ youth culture barometer 2004 ” which measures trends in the younger generation examined the popularity of classical music among listeners between 14 and 25 .
only eight percent of them frequently went to classical concerts and six percent went to the opera . the primary reason for the lack of interest is the way the performances take place , said the director of the center for culture research , andreas wiesand .
“ classical concerts just aren ’ t very motivating .
younger people want something more informal .
they ’ re not willing to sit sill for three hours , ” he said . according to the culture expert , it ’ s a generational problem .

last week , the lse rejected a takeover proposal from german rival deutsche boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £ 1.35bn.
the lse , which saw its shares rise 25 % , said the bid undervalued the business .
euronext - formed after the brussels , paris and amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer .
the lse , europe 's biggest stock market , is a key prize , listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £ 1.4 trillion .

it has long wanted to link up with london , and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000 .
responding to the lse 's rebuff , deutsche boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £ 3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits , and that it still hoped to make a cash bid .

however , it has indicated it is open for further talks .
meanwhile , german magazine der spiegel said part of mr seifert 's negotiations with the lse were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange .
while mr seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of london , the mayor of frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost german jobs .
many analysts believe german boerse has more financial firepower than euronext if it came to a bidding war .

five police officers were hurt during struggles at birmingham 's repertory theatre on saturday night .
two men were arrested and the theatre said some demonstrators stormed the building before the performance of behzti -lrb- dishonour -rrb- was cancelled .
the theatre and the sikh community will meet police on monday .
the characters in the play are not intended to be representative of the sikh community theatre statement anger at sikh ' slur ' a ' provocative ' writer the theatre has been the scene of several protests by members of the sikh community , angered by author gurpreet bhatti 's depiction of murder and sex abuse .
the protesters claim the play , which centres around two characters and is set in a gurdwara , a sikh temple , mocks their faith .
the play 's author has revealed threats had been made against her and she has been advised by police not to say anything in public .
saturday night 's protest turned violent at 1845 gmt as around 400 people gathered outside the theatre .
' work of fiction ' five people were arrested after several protests were held outside the building earlier in the week .
mohan singh , a local sikh community leader , said : " when they 're doing a play about a sikh priest raping somebody inside a gurdwara , would any religion take it ? "
in a statement , the birmingham repertory said more than 800 people were evacuated , security guards were attacked , a foyer door was destroyed , windows were broken in a restaurant and demonstrators entered back stage and smashed equipment .
sikh leaders wanted the play set in a community centre none of the audience were said to have been hurt .
supt russell smith , from west midlands police , said : " our stance is to enable people to make a peaceful protest .
" but they have to respect the public and they have to respect the people who want to actually attend . "
the faith leaders had asked for the setting to be changed from a temple to a community centre .
theatre management insist the play is a work of fiction and no comment is being made about sikhism as a faith .
the roman catholic archbishop of birmingham , the most reverend vincent nichols , said : " such a deliberate , even if fictional , violation of the sacred place of the sikh religion demeans the sacred places of every religion . "

founded by north american quakers , monteverde is considered one of the world 's most important nature reserves for its variety of plant and animal species .
in one sense , the reserve could become a victim of costa rica 's success .
it is considered only a matter of time before the last segment of a journey from san jose , the capital of costa rica , to the resort town santa elena - just four miles from the monteverde reserve - is paved .
once the road is paved , the journey from san jose will be cut from four or five hours to about two hours and the total number of tourists to the area could double from the current 250,000 to 500,000 .
not all of the tourists will be heading for the nature reserve .
adventure there has been an increased demand for adventure tourism in santa elena , where the only tourist options up to now have had an educational purpose and caused little disturbance .
visitors on the canopy tour , for example , use a zip line and travel at high speeds between tree tops - albeit outside the protected park - and then abseil down to the ground .
monteverde flora and fauna 500 species of butterflies 120 kinds of reptiles and frogs 500 types of tree 2,500 kinds of plants 100 species of mammal 400 kinds of birds source : tropical science centre a dense population of tourists , some environmentalists warn , risks upsetting a climatic and geographical balance that now makes monteverde - which is called a cloud forest because of the mists that roll in at any time , shrouding the trees - so unique .
the forest teems with life .
the tilaran highland , where the forest is situated , is a continental divide .
as a result , rainfall is constant , which keeps the forest moist and lush .
it 's no accident that it is named monteverde - green mountain .
finally , it is one of just 12 rainforests left in the world where there is still primary forest : trees that have never been cut .
strains danilo zamora , president of the association for development in monteverde , admits the large increase in visitors that will result from paving the road will put strains on local infrastructure and services , especially as santa elena now has no treatment plant or police force .
" but , " mr zamora says , " i am a representative of the town , not of the tourists .
for santa elena , having a dirt road means everything costs more : construction materials , food supplies , car and bus maintenance .
" and it now takes a long time to drive a sick person or a pregnant woman to hospital , which is dangerous . "
nevertheless , hotel owners , who fear a loss of business , and some environmental advocates , like friends of the earth in costa rica , believe that with a paved road , there will be a change in the quality of tourists .
edward thompson , owner of al tardecer hotel in santa elena , warns : " with a paved road , a lot of tourists will make day trips .
they will come to have lunch and trample down our woods .
" then they will leave , leaving nothing .
we ca n't let monteverde become another cancun " - the beach resort in mexico that has become synonymous with mass tourism .
" we are at a critical point , " mr thompson adds .
" overall , the government needs to do much more to protect the environment .
otherwise , we are going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg . "
confident but mr zamora and ricardo rodriguez , manager of the monteverde reserve - which is now owned and managed by the centro cientifico tropical -lrb- cct -rrb- or tropical science centre , a costa rican non-governmental organisation - are both confident that paving the road will not harm the monteverde reserve .
they say this is because : the reserve is privately owned no hotels have been built near the entrance to the park there are rules which limit the number of visitors to 160 people at any one time there are no plans -lrb- as yet -rrb- to add more trails and lodges in the park , which now represent less than 5 % of the park 's total land .
nevertheless , gabriel rivas of friends of the earth says : " with more tourists , the temptation to make more money will be very strong . "
in these circumstances , he says : " the health of the rainforest will depend on whether the park managers remain serious about limiting the number of visitors .
and it will also depend on the amount of air pollution caused by much greater numbers of people driving to santa elena once the road is paved . "

two workers were injured in an explosion at the lindsey oil refinery in south killingholme on tuesday .
investigations are also being carried out to find out how crude oil seeped into the humber from the refinery which is threatening wildlife sites .
an environment agency spokesman said it appears the oil is now dispersing .
the cause of the leak is thought to be a fractured overland pipeline .
the oil had spilled into the south killingholme drain , an effluent drainage channel which feeds into the south killingholme haven area of the estuary .
there had been fears that the leak could impact heavily on the wildlife habitat .
the south killingholme haven is surrounded by mudflats which are used as feeding and breeding grounds by many species of birds and other animals , including water voles .
the spokesman said : " we do not expect any long-term impact on water quality .
however , we will continue to monitor the situation .
threat to wildlife " an investigation has been launched into the source and the cause of the incident . "
officials from the rspb , english nature and north lincolnshire council are at the site assessing the threat to wildlife .
ten oiled redshank birds have been found by volunteers helping in the cleaning up .
an rspb spokesman said : " although we 're very concerned about reports of oiled birds , we are optimistic that the worst has been averted because this spill was spotted relatively quickly .
" but we are very concerned that there was a large element of luck involved and we would want any inquiry to focus on how these pollution incidents are dealt with in future . "
the environment agency said its investigation could take several weeks to complete and would seek to determine whether legal action could be taken and how to prevent any future spills .

hundreds protested at the repertory theatre in birmingham and will be joined by sikhs from across britain , temple leader mohan singh said .
he told bbc news that outrage at the play had been building among sikhs in the city , particularly the young .
" the youngsters get hot-headed and feelings are running very high . "
' anger has spread ' mr singh , the president of the guru nanak gurdwara in birmingham , representing around 3,000 sikhs , warned that unless the play 's script was changed or the play withdrawn more protests would go ahead next week .
he said : " the play is due to be staged again on thursday and there is no doubt that people will be outside .
" anger has spread throughout the local community over the last weeks and that anger has now gone nationwide .
we know the local people but how can you control others ?
temple leader mohan singh " people from cities across britain will come along to protest .
on saturday there were only 400 people - think what it would be like with five to 10,000 people . "
two men were arrested and a handful of demonstrators attempted to storm the theatre during saturday evening 's performance of the play , entitled behzti -lrb- dishonour -rrb- .
protests have been held by members of the sikh community outside the theatre , known locally as the rep , for around a week with five further arrests .
the community leader said he feared members of the sikh community from outside the city may not be so easy for local leaders or the police to control .
" we know the local people but how can you control others ? " he said .
" we are trying to close the door on this .
all we are asking is for the rep to move 10 % on their position . "
' a slur ' mr singh explained that the content of the play was not the issue but the setting of the scenes .
he said : " we are not bothered about rape scenes or paedophiles - we know that there are good and bad people from every background and religion .
they will paint all sikhs with the same brush temple leader mohan singh " the problem is having these things take place in a temple .
any religion would not take such a slur .
" on saturday they were forced to cancel the show because of the violence but that was nothing .
" since september 11 people have been trying to bridge gaps between communities and then something like this happens .
what is needed is a bit of common sense . "
he added that sikhism was a " minority religion " but that around 250,000 sikhs lived in the midlands .
" we are concerned that people out there who do n't know anything about sikhs will see this and what sort of a picture will they have in their mind ?
" they will paint all sikhs with the same brush . "
mr singh said he did not condone any violent protests but knew that feelings were running high and people would not relax until the theatre changed their position .
he said : " we are due to have a meeting with the chief constable of west midlands police on monday .
we are trying to keep the community calm but we need something to be done . "
