despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .
cooperation would be voluntary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. customs service director robert bonner told the newspaper he expected the trial to start with a pilot program at the airport in warsaw , poland and hoped that the likely success of any cooperation on security there would persuade the other airports to volunteer .
no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .
airlines already have to supply u.s. authorities with data on passengers on trans-atlantic flights , but a december deal brokered between the eu and washington limited the use of such data to comply with eu privacy rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it did n't stop a number of french flights to the u.s. being cancelled over christmas and the new year due to refusals to relinquish certain information .
since new year 's eve , more than a dozen flights to the united states on british airways , aeromexico and air france have been canceled or delayed because of security fears .
sky marshal row rumbles on another sticking point in europe is the u.s. demand for armed sky marshals on certain flights .
at a meeting last month , the british and french governments expressed interest in the notion of armed agents on flights , but other europeans largely stuck to their reservations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a federal air marshal reacts during a mock terrorist hijacking attempt .
" we do not want weapons in the cabin , " said bo eckerbert of the swedish aviation administration in an interview with reporters .
" it may even create more problems than it solves . "
pilot organizations in britain , spain , finland and other countries also expressed strong reservations .
some also called for vetted pilots to be shown documentation and examine intelligence reports of perceived terror threats to ascertain the risk themselves before flights are cancelled . concerns over finger-printing scheme there are also fears about a new tracking system for foreigners inaugurated in january .
the so-called us-visit program requires foreigners entering u.s. airports and seaports from all but 27 nations to have their fingerprints scanned and their photographs taken . the program will check an estimated 24 million foreigners each year , though some will be repeat visitors .
the only exceptions will be those from 27 mostly european nations whose citizens are allowed to come to the united states for up to 90 days without visas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror alert hits transatlantic flights air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks .

would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .
airlines already have to supply u.s. authorities with data on passengers on trans-atlantic flights , but a december deal brokered between the eu and washington limited the use of such data to comply with eu privacy rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it did n't stop a number of french flights to the u.s. being cancelled over christmas and the new year due to refusals to relinquish certain information .
since new year 's eve , more than a dozen flights to the united states on british airways , aeromexico and air france have been canceled or delayed because of security fears .
sky marshal row rumbles on another sticking point in europe is the u.s. demand for armed sky marshals on certain flights .
at a meeting last month , the british and french governments expressed interest in the notion of armed agents on flights , but other europeans largely stuck to their reservations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a federal air marshal reacts during a mock terrorist hijacking attempt .
" we do not want weapons in the cabin , " said bo eckerbert of the swedish aviation administration in an interview with reporters .
" it may even create more problems than it solves . "
pilot organizations in britain , spain , finland and other countries also expressed strong reservations .
some also called for vetted pilots to be shown documentation and examine intelligence reports of perceived terror threats to ascertain the risk themselves before flights are cancelled . concerns over finger-printing scheme there are also fears about a new tracking system for foreigners inaugurated in january .
the so-called us-visit program requires foreigners entering u.s. airports and seaports from all but 27 nations to have their fingerprints scanned and their photographs taken . the program will check an estimated 24 million foreigners each year , though some will be repeat visitors .
the only exceptions will be those from 27 mostly european nations whose citizens are allowed to come to the united states for up to 90 days without visas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror alert hits transatlantic flights air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks .

the head of the local social democratic party announced that a resolution would be passed on thursday making the sale of the bank impossible .
the decision of the mayor of stralsund , in eastern germany , to investigate selling the local sparkasse was heavily criticized by politicians and the umbrella group that represents the country 's dense network of state-owned savings banks .
although the mayor wanted to sell the bank to earn some € 30 to € 50 million to be used to renovate schools and kindergartens , critics were worried that the sale would weaken germany 's three-pillar banking system and could lead to a privatization of other sparkasse banks across the country .

the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .
a new government strategy aims to push the region 's strongest industries to carry the rest along . when the eu 's expansion throws open germany 's borders to eastern europe on may 1 , the already nervous governments of eastern german states could break out into full panic .
the cheaper labor and potentially more attractive investment opportunities in new eu members poland and the czech republic have been ghosts haunting politicians from eastern german states in the months leading up to expansion . " we 're going to be ground up between the stones , " said bernhard lange , who works in the economic ministry of the northeastern state of mecklenburg western-pomerania . federal politicians have been quick to soothe frayed nerves .

" what we 're talking about is an adjustment " in the plan to rebuild the east , stolpe said . highly innovative and future growth fields such as biotech and optical technology will get a larger share of the dwindling money pot .
the government will also shift more money to the economic strengths of each region : tourism in mecklenburg western pomerania , which borders on the baltic sea , will get a larger share of funding as will microelectronics , a burgeoning industry in saxony .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.03.2004 after defeat , schröder vows to continue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform process is proving painful for schröder politically .
despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .
" but the basic nature of the reforms , that will remain the same .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .
he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium prepares to relive child murder trauma belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country .

because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .
a new government strategy aims to push the region 's strongest industries to carry the rest along . when the eu 's expansion throws open germany 's borders to eastern europe on may 1 , the already nervous governments of eastern german states could break out into full panic .
the cheaper labor and potentially more attractive investment opportunities in new eu members poland and the czech republic have been ghosts haunting politicians from eastern german states in the months leading up to expansion . " we 're going to be ground up between the stones , " said bernhard lange , who works in the economic ministry of the northeastern state of mecklenburg western-pomerania . federal politicians have been quick to soothe frayed nerves .
economics minister wolfgang clement said that a large portion of germany 's exports currently go to eastern europe .
once eu membership opens up trade even further , all of germany will benefit even more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement : markets will open " a market will open up that is of immense importance to us , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a recent interview with the newspaper handelsblatt .
" if the economies -lrb- there -rrb- experience an upswing , then it will also be good for german business … of course there will be risks , but i believe the economic advantages will be greater . " eastern germany gets rich - on paper but while waiting for the upswing in eastern europe , brandenburg , mecklenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia wo n't be able to draw on the eu subsidies that have provided " missing capital " to the troubled economic region .
once the new , comparatively poorer countries in eastern europe join , eastern germany 's classification as a poor region needing subsidies will change .
though more than € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- is still guaranteed from brussels until 2006 , the amount will most likely sink as the new countries soak up more of the eu 's budget .
the four eastern german states might no longer count among europe 's poorest regions .
" they 'll calculate us as rich overnight , even though we have not one euro , " harald ringstorff , the premier of mecklenburg western-pomerania told the süddeutsche zeitung . high-tech companies get preference federal officials say weaning the east off these funds is crucial to making the region more competitive .
in light of the shrinking financial resources available , manfred stolpe , the government 's transportation minister , has proposed being more discerning about where the money goes in the future . " what we 're talking about is an adjustment " in the plan to rebuild the east , stolpe said . highly innovative and future growth fields such as biotech and optical technology will get a larger share of the dwindling money pot .
the government will also shift more money to the economic strengths of each region : tourism in mecklenburg western pomerania , which borders on the baltic sea , will get a larger share of funding as will microelectronics , a burgeoning industry in saxony . " we need to make the strong stronger without leaving the weak behind , " said stolpe . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study finds bleak answer to german income question the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed .

advocates for the sale argue that the prohibition is a hindrance to a much needed consolidation of the german banking landscape . more briefs 02.03.2004 -pipe- hsbc not interested in buying german bank 02.03.2004 -pipe- german retail sales bounce back 02.03.2004 -pipe- mcdonald 's germany to focus on healthy fare 01.03.2004 -pipe- subway takes on fast-food kings in germany 01.03.2004 -pipe- germany set to break eu deficit rules , again 01.03.2004 -pipe- labor office faces new scandal 28.02.2004 -pipe- germany raises deficit projection for 2004 27.02.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank reports losses radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .

no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?

who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor .

it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

the report points out that " despite formal judicial progress , citizens ’ rights are not yet fully guaranteed " .
among other issues , the report mentions the practice of torture and the limited freedom of speech and religion as examples of continuing violation of human rights in the country .
the munich researchers conclude that turkey will need " considerable time " to meet the eu ’ s political criteria .
the study by the think-tank is set to be used by german and other opponents of the turkish bid to enter the eu , as it also predicts that turkish membership could cost the union up to 14 billion euro a year . the report further predicts " considerable migration pressure " of turks to germany if turkey joins the eu .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .

but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .

it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .
it takes black-and-white infrared photos and collects data about the comet 's gases and magnetic field . 2002 - nasa 's comet nucleus tour -lrb- contour -rrb- is lost after it began a post-launch burn to leave earth 's orbit .
it should have researched two comets .
2003 - rosetta 's original launch date to land on the comet wirtanen is cancelled due to problems with the ariane rocket .
2004 - nasa 's spacecraft stardust makes the closest-ever approach to a comet , coming within 250 kms of wild 2 after collecting dust samples from its " coma , " the halo-like glow surrounding the comet 's head .
the samples are due to return in a parachuted capsule on jan .
15 , 2006 .
on dec .
30 , 2004 nasa is scheduled to launch deep impact to meet up with comet p / tempel 1 in july 2005 .
it will fire a 350-kilo copper slug at its nucleus and use a spectrometer to analyze the elements of the gases and material that are ejected . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de space probe starts ten-year comet chase did the building blocks of life on earth piggyback on a comet ?

the head of the local social democratic party announced that a resolution would be passed on thursday making the sale of the bank impossible .
the decision of the mayor of stralsund , in eastern germany , to investigate selling the local sparkasse was heavily criticized by politicians and the umbrella group that represents the country 's dense network of state-owned savings banks .
although the mayor wanted to sell the bank to earn some € 30 to € 50 million to be used to renovate schools and kindergartens , critics were worried that the sale would weaken germany 's three-pillar banking system and could lead to a privatization of other sparkasse banks across the country .
advocates for the sale argue that the prohibition is a hindrance to a much needed consolidation of the german banking landscape . more briefs 02.03.2004 -pipe- hsbc not interested in buying german bank 02.03.2004 -pipe- german retail sales bounce back 02.03.2004 -pipe- mcdonald 's germany to focus on healthy fare 01.03.2004 -pipe- subway takes on fast-food kings in germany 01.03.2004 -pipe- germany set to break eu deficit rules , again 01.03.2004 -pipe- labor office faces new scandal 28.02.2004 -pipe- germany raises deficit projection for 2004 27.02.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank reports losses 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the head of the local social democratic party announced that a resolution would be passed on thursday making the sale of the bank impossible .
the decision of the mayor of stralsund , in eastern germany , to investigate selling the local sparkasse was heavily criticized by politicians and the umbrella group that represents the country 's dense network of state-owned savings banks .
although the mayor wanted to sell the bank to earn some € 30 to € 50 million to be used to renovate schools and kindergartens , critics were worried that the sale would weaken germany 's three-pillar banking system and could lead to a privatization of other sparkasse banks across the country .
advocates for the sale argue that the prohibition is a hindrance to a much needed consolidation of the german banking landscape . more briefs 02.03.2004 -pipe- hsbc not interested in buying german bank 02.03.2004 -pipe- german retail sales bounce back 02.03.2004 -pipe- mcdonald 's germany to focus on healthy fare 01.03.2004 -pipe- subway takes on fast-food kings in germany 01.03.2004 -pipe- germany set to break eu deficit rules , again 01.03.2004 -pipe- labor office faces new scandal 28.02.2004 -pipe- germany raises deficit projection for 2004 27.02.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank reports losses 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .

no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.03.2004 after defeat , schröder vows to continue reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reform process is proving painful for schröder politically .
despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .
" but the basic nature of the reforms , that will remain the same .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .

but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .

2003 - rosetta 's original launch date to land on the comet wirtanen is cancelled due to problems with the ariane rocket .
2004 - nasa 's spacecraft stardust makes the closest-ever approach to a comet , coming within 250 kms of wild 2 after collecting dust samples from its " coma , " the halo-like glow surrounding the comet 's head .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .

his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .

" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .

his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .

many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .

dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .

many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .

" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .
it takes black-and-white infrared photos and collects data about the comet 's gases and magnetic field . 2002 - nasa 's comet nucleus tour -lrb- contour -rrb- is lost after it began a post-launch burn to leave earth 's orbit .
it should have researched two comets .
2003 - rosetta 's original launch date to land on the comet wirtanen is cancelled due to problems with the ariane rocket .
2004 - nasa 's spacecraft stardust makes the closest-ever approach to a comet , coming within 250 kms of wild 2 after collecting dust samples from its " coma , " the halo-like glow surrounding the comet 's head .
the samples are due to return in a parachuted capsule on jan .

30 , 2004 nasa is scheduled to launch deep impact to meet up with comet p / tempel 1 in july 2005 .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .
he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium prepares to relive child murder trauma belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .

no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .

dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .
he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium prepares to relive child murder trauma belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.03.2004 u.s. security looks for a home away from home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security officers could be deployed at frankfurt airport and six other international hubs .
the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .
cooperation would be voluntary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. customs service director robert bonner told the newspaper he expected the trial to start with a pilot program at the airport in warsaw , poland and hoped that the likely success of any cooperation on security there would persuade the other airports to volunteer .
no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .
airlines already have to supply u.s. authorities with data on passengers on trans-atlantic flights , but a december deal brokered between the eu and washington limited the use of such data to comply with eu privacy rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it did n't stop a number of french flights to the u.s. being cancelled over christmas and the new year due to refusals to relinquish certain information .
since new year 's eve , more than a dozen flights to the united states on british airways , aeromexico and air france have been canceled or delayed because of security fears .
sky marshal row rumbles on another sticking point in europe is the u.s. demand for armed sky marshals on certain flights .
at a meeting last month , the british and french governments expressed interest in the notion of armed agents on flights , but other europeans largely stuck to their reservations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a federal air marshal reacts during a mock terrorist hijacking attempt .
" we do not want weapons in the cabin , " said bo eckerbert of the swedish aviation administration in an interview with reporters .
" it may even create more problems than it solves . "
pilot organizations in britain , spain , finland and other countries also expressed strong reservations .
some also called for vetted pilots to be shown documentation and examine intelligence reports of perceived terror threats to ascertain the risk themselves before flights are cancelled . concerns over finger-printing scheme there are also fears about a new tracking system for foreigners inaugurated in january .
the so-called us-visit program requires foreigners entering u.s. airports and seaports from all but 27 nations to have their fingerprints scanned and their photographs taken . the program will check an estimated 24 million foreigners each year , though some will be repeat visitors .
the only exceptions will be those from 27 mostly european nations whose citizens are allowed to come to the united states for up to 90 days without visas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror alert hits transatlantic flights air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks .

the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .
a new government strategy aims to push the region 's strongest industries to carry the rest along . when the eu 's expansion throws open germany 's borders to eastern europe on may 1 , the already nervous governments of eastern german states could break out into full panic .
the cheaper labor and potentially more attractive investment opportunities in new eu members poland and the czech republic have been ghosts haunting politicians from eastern german states in the months leading up to expansion . " we 're going to be ground up between the stones , " said bernhard lange , who works in the economic ministry of the northeastern state of mecklenburg western-pomerania . federal politicians have been quick to soothe frayed nerves .
economics minister wolfgang clement said that a large portion of germany 's exports currently go to eastern europe .
once eu membership opens up trade even further , all of germany will benefit even more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement : markets will open " a market will open up that is of immense importance to us , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a recent interview with the newspaper handelsblatt .
" if the economies -lrb- there -rrb- experience an upswing , then it will also be good for german business … of course there will be risks , but i believe the economic advantages will be greater . " eastern germany gets rich - on paper but while waiting for the upswing in eastern europe , brandenburg , mecklenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia wo n't be able to draw on the eu subsidies that have provided " missing capital " to the troubled economic region .
once the new , comparatively poorer countries in eastern europe join , eastern germany 's classification as a poor region needing subsidies will change .
though more than € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- is still guaranteed from brussels until 2006 , the amount will most likely sink as the new countries soak up more of the eu 's budget .
the four eastern german states might no longer count among europe 's poorest regions .
" they 'll calculate us as rich overnight , even though we have not one euro , " harald ringstorff , the premier of mecklenburg western-pomerania told the süddeutsche zeitung . high-tech companies get preference federal officials say weaning the east off these funds is crucial to making the region more competitive .
in light of the shrinking financial resources available , manfred stolpe , the government 's transportation minister , has proposed being more discerning about where the money goes in the future . " what we 're talking about is an adjustment " in the plan to rebuild the east , stolpe said . highly innovative and future growth fields such as biotech and optical technology will get a larger share of the dwindling money pot .
the government will also shift more money to the economic strengths of each region : tourism in mecklenburg western pomerania , which borders on the baltic sea , will get a larger share of funding as will microelectronics , a burgeoning industry in saxony . " we need to make the strong stronger without leaving the weak behind , " said stolpe . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study finds bleak answer to german income question the latest report on how much ordinary germans earn is a case in point for the government ’ s labor reform plans – a widening east-west income gap and soaring non-wage labor costs are some of the problems listed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.03.2004 rosetta comet chaser blasts into space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three 's a charm : rosetta has taken off into space the european space agency 's rosetta orbiter finally started its 5 billion kilometer journey tuesday morning after two postponements last week . rosetta 's mission to catch a comet began from the european spaceport in kourou in french guiana at 8:17 cet with the launch of the ariane 5 rocket that carries the three-ton spacecraft .
minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .
it takes black-and-white infrared photos and collects data about the comet 's gases and magnetic field . 2002 - nasa 's comet nucleus tour -lrb- contour -rrb- is lost after it began a post-launch burn to leave earth 's orbit .
it should have researched two comets .
2003 - rosetta 's original launch date to land on the comet wirtanen is cancelled due to problems with the ariane rocket .
2004 - nasa 's spacecraft stardust makes the closest-ever approach to a comet , coming within 250 kms of wild 2 after collecting dust samples from its " coma , " the halo-like glow surrounding the comet 's head .
the samples are due to return in a parachuted capsule on jan .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.03.2004 keeping eastern germany afloat as the eu expands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optical technology is the eastern german city of jena 's great hope .
the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .
a new government strategy aims to push the region 's strongest industries to carry the rest along . when the eu 's expansion throws open germany 's borders to eastern europe on may 1 , the already nervous governments of eastern german states could break out into full panic .
the cheaper labor and potentially more attractive investment opportunities in new eu members poland and the czech republic have been ghosts haunting politicians from eastern german states in the months leading up to expansion . " we 're going to be ground up between the stones , " said bernhard lange , who works in the economic ministry of the northeastern state of mecklenburg western-pomerania . federal politicians have been quick to soothe frayed nerves .
economics minister wolfgang clement said that a large portion of germany 's exports currently go to eastern europe .
once eu membership opens up trade even further , all of germany will benefit even more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement : markets will open " a market will open up that is of immense importance to us , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a recent interview with the newspaper handelsblatt .
" if the economies -lrb- there -rrb- experience an upswing , then it will also be good for german business … of course there will be risks , but i believe the economic advantages will be greater . " eastern germany gets rich - on paper but while waiting for the upswing in eastern europe , brandenburg , mecklenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringia wo n't be able to draw on the eu subsidies that have provided " missing capital " to the troubled economic region .
once the new , comparatively poorer countries in eastern europe join , eastern germany 's classification as a poor region needing subsidies will change .
though more than € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.3 billion -rrb- is still guaranteed from brussels until 2006 , the amount will most likely sink as the new countries soak up more of the eu 's budget .
the four eastern german states might no longer count among europe 's poorest regions .
" they 'll calculate us as rich overnight , even though we have not one euro , " harald ringstorff , the premier of mecklenburg western-pomerania told the süddeutsche zeitung . high-tech companies get preference federal officials say weaning the east off these funds is crucial to making the region more competitive .
in light of the shrinking financial resources available , manfred stolpe , the government 's transportation minister , has proposed being more discerning about where the money goes in the future . " what we 're talking about is an adjustment " in the plan to rebuild the east , stolpe said . highly innovative and future growth fields such as biotech and optical technology will get a larger share of the dwindling money pot .
the government will also shift more money to the economic strengths of each region : tourism in mecklenburg western pomerania , which borders on the baltic sea , will get a larger share of funding as will microelectronics , a burgeoning industry in saxony .

the eu 's expansion eastwards will lower eu funding to the former east germany and could mean a higher jobless rate .
a new government strategy aims to push the region 's strongest industries to carry the rest along . when the eu 's expansion throws open germany 's borders to eastern europe on may 1 , the already nervous governments of eastern german states could break out into full panic .
the cheaper labor and potentially more attractive investment opportunities in new eu members poland and the czech republic have been ghosts haunting politicians from eastern german states in the months leading up to expansion . " we 're going to be ground up between the stones , " said bernhard lange , who works in the economic ministry of the northeastern state of mecklenburg western-pomerania . federal politicians have been quick to soothe frayed nerves .

once eu membership opens up trade even further , all of germany will benefit even more . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement : markets will open " a market will open up that is of immense importance to us , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a recent interview with the newspaper handelsblatt .

the government will also shift more money to the economic strengths of each region : tourism in mecklenburg western pomerania , which borders on the baltic sea , will get a larger share of funding as will microelectronics , a burgeoning industry in saxony .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .
cooperation would be voluntary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. customs service director robert bonner told the newspaper he expected the trial to start with a pilot program at the airport in warsaw , poland and hoped that the likely success of any cooperation on security there would persuade the other airports to volunteer .
no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .
airlines already have to supply u.s. authorities with data on passengers on trans-atlantic flights , but a december deal brokered between the eu and washington limited the use of such data to comply with eu privacy rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it did n't stop a number of french flights to the u.s. being cancelled over christmas and the new year due to refusals to relinquish certain information .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available .

" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented .

the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon .

" short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .
it takes black-and-white infrared photos and collects data about the comet 's gases and magnetic field . 2002 - nasa 's comet nucleus tour -lrb- contour -rrb- is lost after it began a post-launch burn to leave earth 's orbit .
it should have researched two comets .
2003 - rosetta 's original launch date to land on the comet wirtanen is cancelled due to problems with the ariane rocket .
2004 - nasa 's spacecraft stardust makes the closest-ever approach to a comet , coming within 250 kms of wild 2 after collecting dust samples from its " coma , " the halo-like glow surrounding the comet 's head .
the samples are due to return in a parachuted capsule on jan .

rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .

little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .

" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .
he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium prepares to relive child murder trauma belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .
cooperation would be voluntary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. customs service director robert bonner told the newspaper he expected the trial to start with a pilot program at the airport in warsaw , poland and hoped that the likely success of any cooperation on security there would persuade the other airports to volunteer .
no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .
airlines already have to supply u.s. authorities with data on passengers on trans-atlantic flights , but a december deal brokered between the eu and washington limited the use of such data to comply with eu privacy rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it did n't stop a number of french flights to the u.s. being cancelled over christmas and the new year due to refusals to relinquish certain information .
since new year 's eve , more than a dozen flights to the united states on british airways , aeromexico and air france have been canceled or delayed because of security fears .
sky marshal row rumbles on another sticking point in europe is the u.s. demand for armed sky marshals on certain flights .
at a meeting last month , the british and french governments expressed interest in the notion of armed agents on flights , but other europeans largely stuck to their reservations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a federal air marshal reacts during a mock terrorist hijacking attempt .
" we do not want weapons in the cabin , " said bo eckerbert of the swedish aviation administration in an interview with reporters .
" it may even create more problems than it solves . "
pilot organizations in britain , spain , finland and other countries also expressed strong reservations .
some also called for vetted pilots to be shown documentation and examine intelligence reports of perceived terror threats to ascertain the risk themselves before flights are cancelled . concerns over finger-printing scheme there are also fears about a new tracking system for foreigners inaugurated in january .
the so-called us-visit program requires foreigners entering u.s. airports and seaports from all but 27 nations to have their fingerprints scanned and their photographs taken . the program will check an estimated 24 million foreigners each year , though some will be repeat visitors .
the only exceptions will be those from 27 mostly european nations whose citizens are allowed to come to the united states for up to 90 days without visas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror alert hits transatlantic flights air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .
cooperation would be voluntary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. customs service director robert bonner told the newspaper he expected the trial to start with a pilot program at the airport in warsaw , poland and hoped that the likely success of any cooperation on security there would persuade the other airports to volunteer .
no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.03.2004 rosetta comet chaser blasts into space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three 's a charm : rosetta has taken off into space the european space agency 's rosetta orbiter finally started its 5 billion kilometer journey tuesday morning after two postponements last week . rosetta 's mission to catch a comet began from the european spaceport in kourou in french guiana at 8:17 cet with the launch of the ariane 5 rocket that carries the three-ton spacecraft .
minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .
it takes black-and-white infrared photos and collects data about the comet 's gases and magnetic field . 2002 - nasa 's comet nucleus tour -lrb- contour -rrb- is lost after it began a post-launch burn to leave earth 's orbit .
it should have researched two comets .
2003 - rosetta 's original launch date to land on the comet wirtanen is cancelled due to problems with the ariane rocket .
2004 - nasa 's spacecraft stardust makes the closest-ever approach to a comet , coming within 250 kms of wild 2 after collecting dust samples from its " coma , " the halo-like glow surrounding the comet 's head .
the samples are due to return in a parachuted capsule on jan .

30 , 2004 nasa is scheduled to launch deep impact to meet up with comet p / tempel 1 in july 2005 .

the trial of marc dutroux and his three co-defendants , accused of child kidnap , sexual abuse and murder , opened in the belgian town of arlon on monday and immediately grabbed the attention of the world 's media . belgium ’ s public enemy number one marc dutroux slept soundly behind specially installed bullet proof glass in the chamber of the new , heavily barricaded courthouse , as the presiding judge , stephane goux , opened the country 's trial of the century . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : judge stephane goux .
dutroux , accused of child sex crimes that have sickened a nation , struggled to stay awake as his frustrated legal team prepared to defend him against the charges of kidnapping , sex abuse and murder and earned a severe rebuke from judge goux -lrb- photo -rrb- who urged his lawyers to " wake up your client . "
ronny baudewijn , leading counsel for the defense replied , " he seems to be very tired and had a very bad night . " it is unsurprising that dutroux may be having trouble sleeping .
with hundreds of armed police in the streets outside the courthouse in the southeastern town of arlon , helicopters constantly circling and fortifications added to areas of the chamber , the security forces were taking very seriously the possible threat of a revenge attack on dutroux and his co-defendants .
such is the hatred that has been festering in belgium for eight years since the accused parties were apprehended that dutroux also appeared wearing a kevlar bullet proof vest . emotions running high in arlon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feelings run high outside the court .
there is evidence that those pent up feelings are reaching breaking point with hotels refusing requests for accommodation from anyone associated with marc dutroux , from relatives to legal counsel .
his lawyers are staying at a nearby military barracks because no hotel will take them .
even restaurants , which are seeing surges in profits from the increased trade from those drawn to the case , are giving away a lot of the money they raise to charities connected to the families of the victims . the case has turned the world 's attention on the small town where at least 200 different television companies are encamped , beaming the shame of a nation around the globe , although the majority will not be allowed within the heavily guarded courtroom . somber atmosphere tinged with electricity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who were allowed inside reported that the atmosphere was very somber but crackled with emotion as dutroux and the three other defendants took their places in the glass cage .
beside him sat michel nihoul , a petty crook with a long history of involvement in the sex and drug trade , dutroux 's now estranged wife , michelle martin and a drifter , michel lelièvre . monday 's proceedings were spent selecting six men and six women to stand on the jury and a further twelve to act as reserve .
many of the 180 belgians who were summoned asked to be excused from the trial , several saying they would not be able to withstand the emotional stress of it .
one potential juror told reporters outside the court : " i think it 's very hard , you have to be very conscientious , it will be quite hard to take .
sincerely speaking , i do n't think i am up to it , but it 's not my decision . "
parents come face-to-face with accused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal and his wife betty outside the palace of justice in arlon .
some of the parents of the murdered and kidnapped girls were in court for the proceedings .
after the first session , betty marchal -lrb- photo , with husband paul -rrb- , mother of murdered 17-year-old an , spoke about the moment she once again set eyes on dutroux and his co-defendants .
" it was difficult although i have seen them before , but it was difficult , yes .
because they are sitting there as if nothing is wrong but i think there is definitely a lot of wrong . "
georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .
so for us it is perhaps difficult , for the victims it is really difficult . "
victim prepares to give testimony sabine dardenne , one of the rescued girls is due to testify later this week .
dardenne , then aged 12 , was snatched on may 28 , 1996 , and spent the next 80 days confined to a cellar , where it is alleged she was raped and psychologically abused until her kidnapper was apprehended by police .
she has said the she often reads the journal she kept during those dark days as not to forget and to prepare for her testimony .
" he must pay , " she said of her captor .
with the testimony of hundreds of people to be heard , the trial is expected to last three to four months .
it will be a gruelling process for the families , some of whom were already in tears on the first day of their ordeal . letter alludes to police involvement in child sex ring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux .
dutroux has admitted abducting and confining the children but denied killing them .
however , on the eve of the trial , he sparked further controversy by sending a letter to belgian media saying he was only a small part of a criminal network that had links to belgian law enforcement .
he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if found guilty . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de belgium prepares to relive child murder trauma belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .
it takes black-and-white infrared photos and collects data about the comet 's gases and magnetic field . 2002 - nasa 's comet nucleus tour -lrb- contour -rrb- is lost after it began a post-launch burn to leave earth 's orbit .

georges-henri beauthier , the lawyer for laetitia delhez , one of the surviving girls , described the atmosphere in court .
" it was heavy , really quiet .
quiet because the president wanted to make everything okay , and heavy because it is a strong , strong trial and we are trying to avoid a show , to avoid some fantasy of mr. dutroux .

minutes after lift-off , the main booster rocket and two solid-fuel rockets separated and fell into the atlantic ocean .
the rocket reached the earth 's orbit successfully .
then , slightly later than expected , the rocket 's upper stage ignited , catapulting the craft out of the earth 's gravitational pull and into space almost two hours after its launch .
" the first step has been taken , " rosetta operations manager manfred warhaut said at mission control in darmstadt , south of frankfurt , on tuesday .
" that is a very , very good feeling . "
rosetta is now on its way to meet up with the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
the spacecraft 's probe , philae , is scheduled to land on the celestial body in november 2014 , the first time anything of the sort will be attempted .
substitute comet last week , rosetta 's launch was delayed twice due to high winds and damage to the rocket 's insulation .
the € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- mission was originally scheduled to begin in january 2003 , but then too , technical problems with the rocket caused esa to scratch the launch , and rosetta missed the chance to rendezvous with the comet wirtanen .
churyumov-gerasimenko , named after the soviet scientists who discovered it in 1969 , was chosen instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist 's impression of philae , the rosetta lander , which is supposed to be released onto the surface of the comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 .
little is known about the comet , which esa describes as a " dirty snowball . "
but once rosetta catches up with it , the craft will follow it at speeds of up to 100,000 kilometers -lrb- 62,000 miles -rrb- per hour for a year , while the 100-kilo -lrb- 220-pound -rrb- heavy philae maps its surface and studies its activities .
looking for the solar system 's origins scientists believe comets - orbiting clusters of frozen gas and dust which date back to the beginning of the solar system - may contain vital clues as to how the solar system was formed and maybe even how life itself began on earth .
some astrophysicists contend that comets ' complex molecules may have brought the building blocks for life to earth when they bombarded the planet in its infancy .
the race to discover what makes a comet has been underway for decades : 1985 - nasa 's international cometary explorer -lrb- ice -rrb- traverses the tail of comet giacobini-zinner .
1986 - a small armada of space craft follow halley 's comet : the soviet union 's vega 1 and 2 , nasa 's ice , and japan 's probes suisei and sakigake .
on march 13 and 14 , esa 's giotto comes the closest to the comet with 596 kilometers .
it relayed images of the potato-shaped nucleus back to earth and data showing that comets contain carbon dioxide , hydrogen and oxygen - the building blocks of life . 1992 - continuing its flight through the solar system , giotto passes the comet grigg-skjellerup within 200 kilometers .
esa technicians reactivate the probe and redirect its antenna .
2001 - nasa 's deep space 1 probe comes within 2,200 kms of comet borrelly .
it takes black-and-white infrared photos and collects data about the comet 's gases and magnetic field . 2002 - nasa 's comet nucleus tour -lrb- contour -rrb- is lost after it began a post-launch burn to leave earth 's orbit .
it should have researched two comets .
2003 - rosetta 's original launch date to land on the comet wirtanen is cancelled due to problems with the ariane rocket .
2004 - nasa 's spacecraft stardust makes the closest-ever approach to a comet , coming within 250 kms of wild 2 after collecting dust samples from its " coma , " the halo-like glow surrounding the comet 's head .
the samples are due to return in a parachuted capsule on jan .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.03.2004 u.s. security looks for a home away from home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeland security officers could be deployed at frankfurt airport and six other international hubs .
the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .
cooperation would be voluntary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. customs service director robert bonner told the newspaper he expected the trial to start with a pilot program at the airport in warsaw , poland and hoped that the likely success of any cooperation on security there would persuade the other airports to volunteer .
no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .
airlines already have to supply u.s. authorities with data on passengers on trans-atlantic flights , but a december deal brokered between the eu and washington limited the use of such data to comply with eu privacy rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it did n't stop a number of french flights to the u.s. being cancelled over christmas and the new year due to refusals to relinquish certain information .
since new year 's eve , more than a dozen flights to the united states on british airways , aeromexico and air france have been canceled or delayed because of security fears .
sky marshal row rumbles on another sticking point in europe is the u.s. demand for armed sky marshals on certain flights .
at a meeting last month , the british and french governments expressed interest in the notion of armed agents on flights , but other europeans largely stuck to their reservations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a federal air marshal reacts during a mock terrorist hijacking attempt .
" we do not want weapons in the cabin , " said bo eckerbert of the swedish aviation administration in an interview with reporters .
" it may even create more problems than it solves . "
pilot organizations in britain , spain , finland and other countries also expressed strong reservations .
some also called for vetted pilots to be shown documentation and examine intelligence reports of perceived terror threats to ascertain the risk themselves before flights are cancelled . concerns over finger-printing scheme there are also fears about a new tracking system for foreigners inaugurated in january .
the so-called us-visit program requires foreigners entering u.s. airports and seaports from all but 27 nations to have their fingerprints scanned and their photographs taken . the program will check an estimated 24 million foreigners each year , though some will be repeat visitors .
the only exceptions will be those from 27 mostly european nations whose citizens are allowed to come to the united states for up to 90 days without visas . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror alert hits transatlantic flights air traffic between the u.s. and europe has been crippled over the weekend as a number of transatlantic flights have been grounded following intelligence information al qaeda could be planning further attacks .

the u.s. department of homeland security could station its agents at international airports around the globe in a bid to stop terrorists boarding flights to the u.s. if plans reported earlier this week come to fruition . pentagon officials are drafting a plan which could see united states homeland security officers taking up residence across the globe at major international airports in a bid to prevent potential terrorists from boarding u.s.-bound planes in foreign cities . according to a report in monday 's wall street journal , the plans include a possible working partnership between u.s. agents and local security officers at frankfurt main airport in germany , london 's heathrow and gatwick airports , narita international near tokyo , charles de gaulle in paris , mexico city international and schiphol airport in amsterdam . the agents would review passenger lists and question those travelers who arouse suspicion and those likely to be turned away once they reached the united states . the journal reported that of the 70 million people who fly to the united states every year , the seven airports listed account for 40 percent of those .
cooperation would be voluntary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. customs service director robert bonner told the newspaper he expected the trial to start with a pilot program at the airport in warsaw , poland and hoped that the likely success of any cooperation on security there would persuade the other airports to volunteer .
no one would be forced to take u.s. agents into their airports . however , the proposed initiative raises a number of symbolic and practical questions .
if u.s. sovereignty is extended to foreign airports , could those homeland security agents abroad arrest someone in that foreign country ?
would a homeland security officer be allowed to carry , and use , a firearm there ?
who would make the final decision on who could fly to the u.s. and what would happen to anyone who refused the authority of the agent ? one european airlines group official asked the journal whether the united states would reciprocate by allowing foreign officers to work in u.s. airports , seeing as how " the war on terrorism is global . " u.s. customs agents have operated outside the united states , in canadian airports , for some time .
in addition , their mandate has been extended to cover the screening of cargo headed to the united states from some international seaports .
plans could cause more friction over airline security bonner also told the journal that the program could avoid flight cancellations and fines to airlines which carry travelers without proper documentation to the united states , two of the main reasons behind recent friction between some governments and washington regarding airline security .
airlines already have to supply u.s. authorities with data on passengers on trans-atlantic flights , but a december deal brokered between the eu and washington limited the use of such data to comply with eu privacy rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , it did n't stop a number of french flights to the u.s. being cancelled over christmas and the new year due to refusals to relinquish certain information .
since new year 's eve , more than a dozen flights to the united states on british airways , aeromexico and air france have been canceled or delayed because of security fears .
sky marshal row rumbles on another sticking point in europe is the u.s. demand for armed sky marshals on certain flights .
at a meeting last month , the british and french governments expressed interest in the notion of armed agents on flights , but other europeans largely stuck to their reservations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a federal air marshal reacts during a mock terrorist hijacking attempt .
" we do not want weapons in the cabin , " said bo eckerbert of the swedish aviation administration in an interview with reporters .
" it may even create more problems than it solves . "
pilot organizations in britain , spain , finland and other countries also expressed strong reservations .
some also called for vetted pilots to be shown documentation and examine intelligence reports of perceived terror threats to ascertain the risk themselves before flights are cancelled . concerns over finger-printing scheme there are also fears about a new tracking system for foreigners inaugurated in january .
the so-called us-visit program requires foreigners entering u.s. airports and seaports from all but 27 nations to have their fingerprints scanned and their photographs taken . the program will check an estimated 24 million foreigners each year , though some will be repeat visitors .

despite the defeat of the social democrats in hamburg elections , chancellor schröder insists he will continue with his economic reform plans .
but he 's under intense pressure from unions to slow the pace . german chancellor gerhard schröder described the defeat on sunday in the one-time social democratic bastion as a painful one , but says he remains committed to his course of reforms aimed at getting germany 's economy up and running again .
but judging from recent comments from both social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and business leaders following the rout in hamburg , the headache could just be beginning for the chancellor . " the situation is very serious , he 's stuck in his reform whirlpool and he has to do something , " karl-rudolf korte , political scientist at the university of duisburg-essen , told dw-world . hamburg voters punished schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for his unpopular program of economic welfare cuts and social and labor market reforms , known as agenda 2010 , by handing the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- an absolute majority in the northern port city .
it was an inauspicious beginning to a year lined with 13 other elections that are widely expected to be referendums on schröder 's government . despite the warning from voters , schröder insisted on monday that he will continue to follow the path of reform , " because there is no other sensible alternative . "
several leading figures in the spd echoed those statements . economics minister wolfgang clement told daily berliner zeitung that the spd had a difficult path before it .
" we knew that , and we have to stick it out , " he said .
" it must be clear that wavering and wobbling will not help the spd . " at a party conference on monday in berlin 's city hall , franz müntefering , the designated party chairman , compared the work of the spd to that of sisyphus , the figure from greek mythology who was condemned to roll a huge stone up a hill in hades for eternity only to have it roll down again on nearing the top .
still , münterfering told the party members gathered , sisyphus always pushed the stone to the top again . but the hamburg defeat has unsettled many party members , who may in theory agree that the reform course must go forward , but who are worried that the health of the party will be sacrificed in the process .
they fear party leaders are losing touch with the spd grassroots , who feel the party 's principles are being discarded for the sake of reform , according to political scientist korte . unions want a change of course on monday evening , michael sommer -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , and other union leaders met with schröder and renewed their criticism of the reform course , calling them " poison for business and the labor market " and socially unfair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer sommer urged the chancellor to roll back new regulations for the long-term unemployed and introduce a fine for companies who do not make traineeships available . " the chancellor made it clear that he does n't see an alternative to his policies , " walter haas , dgb head in north rhine-westphalia , told german radio .
" and we made it clear where we 're of the opinion that our requests for change must urgently be implemented . " the deputy head of the verdi services union , margret mönig-raana , said the government was n't getting the message that the reforms were alienating voters . " i do n't know how many elections are going to have to be lost , before it dawns -lsb- on this government -rsb- , " she said . the left-wing of the spd renewed its own criticism about the need for a course correction .
the spd head in north rhine-westphalia , harald schartau , said the party leadership had failed to communicate with voters about what the reforms were all about , and left them with the impression that only painful change stood on the horizon . " the perspective behind all these changes has not been made clear , " he said . rock and a hard place schröder finds himself stuck between continuing with reforms , which have been widely welcomed by economists and german business leaders , and risk alienating his own party and losing popular support . political analyst korte told dw-world that the reform process would likely keep moving forward , though possibly at reduced speed . " short term , he 's got to do something about the pressure he 's feeling from party members , " korte said , such as changing the pace of reforms and making some symbolic concessions to the unions and the left wing .
" but the basic nature of the reforms , that will remain the same .

hundreds of thousands are in the iraqi holy city for events to mourn the death there of imam hussain , grandson of the prophet mohammed , in the year 680 .
his death is being marked by rhythmic chanting and ritual self-flagellation from devotees clad in black .
ashura was severely restricted under former iraqi leader saddam hussein .
a lot of people are coming here really to express their determination to practice their political role and express their voice very loudly dr hussein ashestani mourner the bbc 's heba saleh says that he feared the mass festival 's potential to foment rebellion .
many of the devotees in karbala this year have come illegally from neighbouring iran , which , like iraq , has a majority shia population .
a lot of the new arrivals have been sleeping in tents or on the streets with volunteers providing them with food .
security is tight , with checkpoints set up around karbala and religious militias guarding holy shrines .
years of repression the death of hussein at the hands of the caliph yazid cemented the split between sunni and shia islam over who should lead the faith .
shia were repressed under saddam 's sunni-dominated regime , toppled last year by a us-led coalition which now occupies the country .
the shrine of imam hussein is the focus of celebrations india 's shias rest in hope observation of ashura was hampered by a ban on the practice of ritual self-beating and cutting the skin .
pilgrims from iran - a wartime enemy of saddam hussein 's iraq - were not welcome at karbala while he was in power , one of shia islam 's holiest sites .
our correspondent notes that other rulers before saddam hussein similarly sought to curb the mass shia rituals , from the ottomans and mamelukes to the british in the last century .
the climax of ashura comes a day after iraq 's interim governing council agreed a draft constitution for the country .
one mourner , dr hussein ashestani , said political protest was a central part of this year 's ashura .
" a lot of people are coming here really to express their determination to practice their political role and express their voice very loudly , " dr ashestani told the bbc .
" they are all insisting that we will not accept anything but elections and will not recognise any unelected body . "
an afp correspondent noted that a group of about 150 students from baghdad university were chanting anti-coalition slogans such as " down , down america " and burning an american flag .
this year 's event coincides with the growing dominance of shia in post-saddam iraq - leading to fears that disgruntled sunni militants may target the celebrations .
to prevent this , karbala has been ringed by security forces - with polish soldiers policing the town 's entry points and shia militia guarding its streets and shrines .

a lot of people are coming here really to express their determination to practice their political role and express their voice very loudly dr hussein ashestani mourner the bbc 's heba saleh says that he feared the mass festival 's potential to foment rebellion .
many of the devotees in karbala this year have come illegally from neighbouring iran , which , like iraq , has a majority shia population .
a lot of the new arrivals have been sleeping in tents or on the streets with volunteers providing them with food .
security is tight , with checkpoints set up around karbala and religious militias guarding holy shrines .
years of repression the death of hussein at the hands of the caliph yazid cemented the split between sunni and shia islam over who should lead the faith .
shia were repressed under saddam 's sunni-dominated regime , toppled last year by a us-led coalition which now occupies the country .
the shrine of imam hussein is the focus of celebrations india 's shias rest in hope observation of ashura was hampered by a ban on the practice of ritual self-beating and cutting the skin .
pilgrims from iran - a wartime enemy of saddam hussein 's iraq - were not welcome at karbala while he was in power , one of shia islam 's holiest sites .
our correspondent notes that other rulers before saddam hussein similarly sought to curb the mass shia rituals , from the ottomans and mamelukes to the british in the last century .
the climax of ashura comes a day after iraq 's interim governing council agreed a draft constitution for the country .
one mourner , dr hussein ashestani , said political protest was a central part of this year 's ashura .
" a lot of people are coming here really to express their determination to practice their political role and express their voice very loudly , " dr ashestani told the bbc .
" they are all insisting that we will not accept anything but elections and will not recognise any unelected body . "
an afp correspondent noted that a group of about 150 students from baghdad university were chanting anti-coalition slogans such as " down , down america " and burning an american flag .
this year 's event coincides with the growing dominance of shia in post-saddam iraq - leading to fears that disgruntled sunni militants may target the celebrations .
to prevent this , karbala has been ringed by security forces - with polish soldiers policing the town 's entry points and shia militia guarding its streets and shrines .

in addition to closures new laws could boost numbers of gambling addicts , the study from marketing company the henley centre says .
the draft gambling bill , currently in its committee stage , will see the numbers of casinos rise hugely .
the study also suggested gambling through the internet , interactive tv and mobile phones will also rocket .
the number of casinos will almost double from 122 to 241 , including five resort-style venues such as a rejuvenated blackpool , the study said .
but the gains for casinos could spell closure for over a thousand pubs , its authors warn .
the amount spent on betting and gaming in the uk will jump from £ 8.5 billion a year to £ 10.6bn by 2010 with the new laws , according to the report which was commissioned by the british amusement catering trade association .
but while that could mean a £ 2.1bn rise in casino spending , there could also be a £ 1bn reduction in traditional gambling .
there are currently around 400,000 problem gamblers - or 0.8 % of the population , the study says .
it warns that while the number could rise to 500,000 by 2010 without the bill , its introduction would take the figure to 700,000 .
ray stone , a director of the henley centre , said : " the national figures hide a variety of local impacts which , although they could be positive in term of new gambling venues , could also be negative in terms of closures of bingo clubs and pubs and their associated implications .
" it is vital the government takes into account the full social and economic impact of deregulation covering big business , small business , local issues , employment , problem gambling and , of course , tax . "
a spokesman for the department of culture , media and sport said : " we believe local businesses will benefit from the introduction of more casinos . "
and he added : " the number of problem gamblers is relatively low and we will be encouraging the gambling industry to ensure it remains that way . "

there are currently around 400,000 problem gamblers - or 0.8 % of the population , the study says .
it warns that while the number could rise to 500,000 by 2010 without the bill , its introduction would take the figure to 700,000 .
ray stone , a director of the henley centre , said : " the national figures hide a variety of local impacts which , although they could be positive in term of new gambling venues , could also be negative in terms of closures of bingo clubs and pubs and their associated implications .
" it is vital the government takes into account the full social and economic impact of deregulation covering big business , small business , local issues , employment , problem gambling and , of course , tax . "
a spokesman for the department of culture , media and sport said : " we believe local businesses will benefit from the introduction of more casinos . "
and he added : " the number of problem gamblers is relatively low and we will be encouraging the gambling industry to ensure it remains that way . "

the barred from voting campaign is being spearheaded by unlock , the national association of ex-offenders , and has cross party support from mps .
more than 50 organisations are calling for the review of the 134-year-old law which means inmates are stripped of their voting rights .
the campaign described the right to vote as an inalienable human right .
in a statement , campaigners said the right to vote was enshrined in the european convention on human rights .
they said the ban was not an effective deterrent and did not contribute to public safety .
voting in prison can be a useful first step to engaging in society peter bottomley mp they also suggest the ban contributes to the failure of imprisonment to rehabilitate six out of 10 offenders .
they believe allowing prisoners to vote would encourage them to be more responsible , law-abiding citizens .
politicians would be forced to take more interest in prison welfare if inmates could vote , the report adds .
minority groups the report said denying prisoners the vote undermines the government 's civic renewal and active citizenship agenda .
minority ethnic groups are disproportionately affected due to their over-representation in prison , the report said .
black men are eight times as likely to be barred from voting than their white counterparts , it claimed .
mark oaten , home affairs spokesman for the liberal democrats , said : " britain 's prisons are failing .
" they are failing prisoners , they are failing communities and they are failing the taxpayer .
" if we want people to return to their communities as law-abiding citizens , we must encourage them to play a positive part in shaping their futures . "
peter bottomley , the conservative mp and former minister , said : " ex-offenders and ex-prisoners should be active responsible citizens .
" voting in prison can be a useful first step to engaging in society . "
society peter selby , bishop to hm prisons , said denying convicted prisoners the vote served no purpose of deterrence or reform .
" what it does state in the clearest possible terms is society 's belief that once convicted you are a non-person , one who should have no say in how our society is to develop , " he said .
sir david ramsbotham , the former hm inspector of prisons , said : " all citizens of the united kingdom have the vote by right - not moral authority .
who else ca n't vote ?
hereditary peers who are members of the house of lords patients detained in psychiatric hospitals as a result of their crimes foreign nationals " one of the aims of imprisonment is to help prisoners to live useful and law-abiding lives .
" removing a citizen 's right is an additional punishment to the deprivation of liberty . "
most european countries allow prisoners to vote .
ireland , the netherlands and spain are among 18 countries with no ban .
eight other european countries ban some sentenced prisoners from voting .
in france and germany , courts have the power to impose loss of voting rights as an additional punishment .
for the second year running england and wales has the highest imprisonment rate in the european union at 141 per 100,000 of the population .

the barred from voting campaign is being spearheaded by unlock , the national association of ex-offenders , and has cross party support from mps .
more than 50 organisations are calling for the review of the 134-year-old law which means inmates are stripped of their voting rights .
the campaign described the right to vote as an inalienable human right .
in a statement , campaigners said the right to vote was enshrined in the european convention on human rights .
they said the ban was not an effective deterrent and did not contribute to public safety .
voting in prison can be a useful first step to engaging in society peter bottomley mp they also suggest the ban contributes to the failure of imprisonment to rehabilitate six out of 10 offenders .
they believe allowing prisoners to vote would encourage them to be more responsible , law-abiding citizens .
politicians would be forced to take more interest in prison welfare if inmates could vote , the report adds .
minority groups the report said denying prisoners the vote undermines the government 's civic renewal and active citizenship agenda .
minority ethnic groups are disproportionately affected due to their over-representation in prison , the report said .
black men are eight times as likely to be barred from voting than their white counterparts , it claimed .
mark oaten , home affairs spokesman for the liberal democrats , said : " britain 's prisons are failing .
" they are failing prisoners , they are failing communities and they are failing the taxpayer .
" if we want people to return to their communities as law-abiding citizens , we must encourage them to play a positive part in shaping their futures . "
peter bottomley , the conservative mp and former minister , said : " ex-offenders and ex-prisoners should be active responsible citizens .
" voting in prison can be a useful first step to engaging in society . "
society peter selby , bishop to hm prisons , said denying convicted prisoners the vote served no purpose of deterrence or reform .
" what it does state in the clearest possible terms is society 's belief that once convicted you are a non-person , one who should have no say in how our society is to develop , " he said .
sir david ramsbotham , the former hm inspector of prisons , said : " all citizens of the united kingdom have the vote by right - not moral authority .
who else ca n't vote ?
hereditary peers who are members of the house of lords patients detained in psychiatric hospitals as a result of their crimes foreign nationals " one of the aims of imprisonment is to help prisoners to live useful and law-abiding lives .
" removing a citizen 's right is an additional punishment to the deprivation of liberty . "
most european countries allow prisoners to vote .
ireland , the netherlands and spain are among 18 countries with no ban .
eight other european countries ban some sentenced prisoners from voting .
in france and germany , courts have the power to impose loss of voting rights as an additional punishment .
for the second year running england and wales has the highest imprisonment rate in the european union at 141 per 100,000 of the population .

the chemical , used on crops including maize and sunflowers , damages the bees ' sense of direction so they become lost .
it is used in the uk on several crops , though not in exactly the way it is used in france , and british beekeepers have been urged to be on their guard .
uk apiarists say the value of bees to the agricultural economy is immense , and they fear bees are becoming rarer .
the chemical implicated in the loss of french bees is imidacloprid , marketed under a variety of names including gaucho .
it is slowly released in the plants , protecting them against insect attack by destroying their ability to find their way .
a london newspaper , the observer , reported : " almost immediately after the chemicals were introduced 10 years ago , beekeepers reported that their bees were becoming disoriented and dying .
used in uk " within a few years honey production in south-west france fell by 60 % .
according to the chairman of the national beekeepers ' association , jean-marie sirvins , a third of the country 's 1.5 million registered hives disappeared .
" as a result , france has had to import up to 24,000 tons of honey annually . "
the pesticide companies say their products are not responsible for killing the bees .
there are no reports of any ill effects from applications of imidacloprid in the uk , where it is licensed for use on beet .
there are restrictions on its use when the plants are in flower , or for spraying the foliage .
but richard jones , the director of the international bee research association , told bbc news online : " beekeepers here have to be on the alert .
more needed " the varroa mite , which feeds on the bees ' blood , arrived from mainland europe , and we know that bees ' nests can travel a long way on container ships .
" people hear about bees and think only about honey , but it 's the other side of the problem that 's worrying .
" they add billions of pounds to the value of the agricultural economy every year because of their work in pollinating crops like apples .
" we do n't have enough bees in the uk , and we have very few feral bees .
every time a hedgerow is destroyed , that means the loss of nesting places for bumblebees . "

a packet of tea with the fair trade premium may cost 40p more than other brands , but many of us happily pay the extra in the knowledge that tea farmers in the developing world are not being exploited .
the fair trade food market has become so hot , that tesco launched on monday its own fair trade brand , while the rival co-op chain is doubling its line .
tesco 's new own fairtrade brand includes orange juice , mangoes and roses , as well as the coffee , tea and chocolate it has kept in stock for many years .
" a certain group of customers have always bought our fair trade goods .
we are trying to make the brand appeal to all our customers , " tesco spokesman greg sage said .
fairtrade foundation , the organisation which promotes better working conditions and trade terms for developing world producers , says annual fair food sales have hit the £ 100m mark .
growth since the fairtrade label was launched 10 years ago has stood at between 40-90 % a year , expanding from one brand of coffee to 250 foods , including fruit , juices , vegetables , snacks , wine , tea , sugar , honey and nuts .

" -lsb- shoppers -rsb- have shown that , contrary to supermarket logic , they are concerned about something more than price , " she says .
and this has been achieved without the massive advertising campaigns employed by the bigger brands , she adds .
fairtrade 's history aid organisations were among the first to promote fair trade by enabling third world producers to sell their goods - usually handicrafts - directly to the western consumer , often in their charity shops .
while the schemes pulled some families out of poverty , fairtrade recognised the need for the programmes to include a greater number of goods , be embraced by commercial manufacturers and to bring fair trade into the supermarkets where most people shop .
fairtrade facts fairtrade has 3 % of the uk 's coffee market 4 % of bananas are sold at a fair price one in four britons recognise the fairtrade mark there are 250 fair trade products in the uk the first fairtrade consumer guarantee - the max havelaar label - was launched in the netherlands in 1989 .

the fairtrade labelling organisations international was set up in april 1997 to introduce a single international fairtrade label .
brands have gone from strength to strength : now on offer are fair trade roses from kenya , footballs from pakistan and organic chocolate spreads , as well as coffee , tea and vegetables .
but it is still a small market , dr andrei sarychev from the london school of economics points out .
" as trade intensifies , the problem of fairness will be solved on its own accord ... fairness reflects intensive competition , " he says .
trading houses , which are sometimes regarded as the middle men who take most of the profits can be a good thing , as long as there are many of them , he adds .
celebrity appeal nonetheless , fashion designers are jumping on the fair trade bandwagon .
this week in london , people tree , a fair trade fashion company which works with 70 fair trade groups in 20 developing countries , is showcasing its lines .
the company pays its suppliers 20-30 % more than they would receive without the fair trade deals and guarantees them work .
the company , which started operating in britain three years ago , is going from strength to strength , says helen osgerby .
" minnie driver has apparently ordered a catalogue , " she added .

the party leader , michael howard , has said lord butler had chosen to examine the evidence in an unacceptably restricted fashion .
the liberal democrats had refused to take part from the beginning , saying the terms of reference were too narrow .
it comes amidst the claims by former cabinet minister clare short that british spies had been involved in bugging un secretary general kofi annan .
what 's your view on the case for the iraq war ?
are the conservative party right to pull out of the butler inquiry ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue nick , london , uk i vehemently opposed the war .
however the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue - they are even more into kow-towing to the usa than tony and co .
there 's absolutely no doubt in my mind that they would have gone to war in iraq on at least as flimsy a pretext as labour did .
nick , london , uk i think time will only tell whether it was worth it or not and the people will be better expressing their views at a general election .
let 's move on , i am bored with the whole thing and these inquires are just being used by claire and other left wing extremists for personal gain and revenge !
martin , north england this inquiry is going to be a whitewash like the last , and rather then face a public backlash the tories have decided to do the sensible thing and withdraw .
mr blair can no longer hide behind these inquiries , he must come out , face the public , and tell us why he really took our country and our troops to an illegal war .
ahmed saeed , glasgow , scotland i think the conservatives made a blunder in allowing this discredited government to hoodwink them into joining this sham of an inquiry in the first place .
after hutton , they should have known better !
however , at least they are getting out now and butler will be written off before it even delivers its whitewash .
richard , kidderminster , england good on them .
i am a labour supporter , but i am becoming more and more ashamed where tony blair and his friends are leading the institution of labour .
the founding fathers must be turning in their graves .
boh , manchester demands for the publication of the attorney general 's ruling , clare short on the rampage and now michael howard announces the tories are withdrawing from the wmd inquiry .
it smacks of opportunism but then he 's good at that .
peter haymes , felixstowe we all know the answer to whether the war was legal or not .
i am not a conservative supporter but welcome their move .
tony blair will never have another vote from me .
jamie , glasgow i believe it was totally wrong to go to war over iraq .
our political system must be modernised to stop dictatorial politicians who contemptuously dismiss the will of the people .
all of our political parties promote elected dictatorship and it 's ' time for change ' !
brian langfield , yorkshire , uk the tory party is correct to distance itself from this inquiry .
this labour government has lost all credibility at home and is fast losing it abroad .
a full and independent public inquiry to investigate the case and legality for the iraq war is now required .
nothing else will do .
robin prior , burnham-on-crouch , uk by broadening the inquiry it 's obvious that all the tories want to do is target individuals and specifically tony blair .
it would be nice if for a change they actually came up with something interesting and relevant than to just keep going on about how bad blair is etc etc .
do something interesting and maybe you 'll get voted for .
rob brennan , barnstaple the war was illegal .
it violated international laws , it was in contravention of combative rules of engagement , it does not constitute a " just war " , and every day as an occupying force we are continuing to commit this crime .
the conservative party are right to pull out , but they should never have been in it in the first place .
blair and bush must both resign and be prosecuted for their acts .
tom franklin , london , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition misbah , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition .
after the hutton report anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that this would be an even bigger fit-up .
well done the lib-dems for immediately smelling the stench of pure corruption which is emanating from this government and welcome to reality to the tory party !
misbah , uk good move by the tories .
people will rightly question the government 's position now and the terms of reference they gave butler .
mr blair now has many questions to answer and this debate will rumble on for a while yet .
jon lewis , cardiff , wales , uk the lib dems , who taunt those who reconsider a position after closer examination of facts , ought to remember the riposte : " i , sir , when i find that i had been wrong , promptly change my mind .
you , sir , what do you do ? "
hugh , london , england personally i am disgusted that politicians just regard us all as idiots to be duped when it suits them .
but of course as usual the last people to be found guilty of lying to those that they " serve " will be the politicians .
after all they never lie and are never wrong , are they ?
hutton " proved " that .
nm , uk butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw james rae , london england butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw and hopefully this will either rubbish the enquiry before it 's even published its report , or the terms of reference will be changed to broaden the brief and allow the truth to come out .
james rae , london england what is the point of this inquiry ?
it is clearly just window dressing .
furthermore , like hutton , it gets the relevant individuals off the hook so they do n't have to answer questions -lrb- yet again -rrb- , it 's full of spin and pr like everything from this government , and it 's going to cost me personally a lot of money -lrb- yet again -rrb- .
i 'm really not impressed .
alan marson , birmingham , england i am surprised that the tories are pulling out of the enquiry .
their actions are unlikely to force any kind of change to the enquiry 's terms of reference and will leave them in a weaker position with regard to getting at tony blair .
perhaps michael howard has decided to sit back and let bbc journalists prize the prime minister out of office , as they surely will .
howard , manchester , uk i fully support michael howard 's courageous and honourable decision .
the butler inquiry will be " iraq whitewash 2 " , a waste of time and public money .
the only purpose that the butler inquiry now serves is as part of the beleaguered campaign to re-elect tony blair .
mike white , london , england let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short john hammond , oxford , uk let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short .
the public can decide which enquiry goes into the details we want to know i.e. why did we " really " go to war ... was it economic reasons , wmd 's or an instruction from israel ?
john hammond , oxford , uk the tories have had a terrible time on iraq from the moment they gave blair support in waging george bush 's illegal war .
the lib dems are the only party coming out of this looking good .
but by saying that mates can stay on the committee in a personal capacity if he wants to , michael howard is taking a bad situation and making it embarrassingly worse .
we 're back in ids territory here - it 'll be okay as long as you 're emphatic every time you change your mind !
duncan hothersall , edinburgh , scotland tony blair 's insistence that there were wmd and that the british intelligence was correct makes him look like a fool .
he must face the facts and instigate an inquiry into how the government and the intelligence services got everything so horribly wrong .
blair should and must resign .
william hoggarth , loughborough , uk there was never a case for war on iraq based on wmd ... oil for the usa yes , a threat to global security i do n't think so !
if the enquiry now consists of just labour members & one tory , -lrb- if michael mates stays on it -rrb- , who does n't represent the tory party , then the enquiry should stop .
oh and then we should have another enquiry into why the enquiry went wrong !
david may , glossop england it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone mark h , uk it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone , saddam has been ousted -lrb- no-one can deny that that is a good thing ... -rrb- and now we rattle on about whether it was legal or not .
why waste time discussing it ?
if , as many people believe , blair was wrong and if , as many people believe , he lied , then the answer is simple .
have the courage of your convictions and do n't vote for blair at the next election .
then you will have had your say .
mark h , uk the conservatives -lrb- like the lib dems -rrb- are starting to sense that the public is getting tired of their exploiting the difficulties surrounding the war in iraq for their own political gain .
can we now begin to discuss what the state of things would be if no action had been taken in iraq ?
mark , wales mr howard has illustrated very graphically that the purpose of these inquiries is nothing to do with a search for truth and enlightenment , but is entirely political from both sides .
tony , liverpool the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no differente nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey there is little point in having an " inquiry " when it is set up , and has its terms of reference set , by the defence ... again .
the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no different and the opposition parties are right to have absolutely nothing to do with it .
nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey are the tories becoming an opposition ?
if they are then it 's about time .
barry , godalming uk whatever ones views on the rights or wrongs of going to war one thing is certain the conservative party have not come out of it in a good light .
unlike the lib dems the conservatives supported the war and at times were more " hawkish " than the government .
the war was clearly unpopular with the general public and the tories are now trying to backtrack - it wo n't wash !
they have little to attack the government on the home front and are now resorting to this , it strikes at desperation !
the election when it comes will be fought on domestic issues and the conservatives know they will have no chance then !
iain d monaghan , uk what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
richard , uk absolutely right , what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
just bring on the elections and lets get rid of labour and poodle blair !
richard , uk we should all be proud of our armed forces and the uk 's role in removing a vicious dictator who tortured and murdered his own people .
the victims of saddam seem to have been forgotten by the anti-war , anti-government brigade .
david morris , brecon uk the truth is out there !
it 's just we 'll never find it ...
rob , uk bearing in mind the very restricted nature of the remit is it any surprise ?
this enquiry is not what the public want .
they want a real inquiry as to why we went to war , not an enquiry into the processes involved in making that decision .
clearly there is considerable public unrest as to how the decisions were made , by whom and on what information .
terry , epsom , england if it is restricted , all we can look forward to is millions of pounds of wasted taxpayers ' money and a hefty document at the end of it that says nothing , criticises nobody , fails to answer any of the main issues and simply raises a whole new set of questions .
it 's only achievement will be to take the heat off the government for a few months whilst the storm dies down .
something we 've seen rather a lot of recently .
martin , london , uk will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk people praised robin cook for pulling out from the government before the war and accused clare short of disingenuousness for leaving after the events .
will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part in whitewash part ii and scorn michael howard and the conservatives for supporting , then withdrawing from this alleged enquiry when they realised they could not get any political gain from it ?
pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk the issue is being cleverly fudged .
saddam is an evil swine and had to be brought down .
however , were the country and the house of commons misled by the prime minister ?
surely , that is the question that needs answering by an inquiry , and it is a resigning issue .
tim sudbury , walpole st peter , norfolk michael howard is playing party politics here , just like the lib dems .
i am disappointed , being a tory voter , because i thought michael howard would get away from this sort of destructive point scoring .
surely the perception of politics & politicians in the uk has hit rock bottom by now ?
roger morgan freedlan , whitwick , england the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here mike , south oxfordshire the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here .
considering my tory mp said , in a reply to my request to vote against going to war , that there were three reasons why we should go to war : -lrb- 1 -rrb- wmd -lrb- 2 -rrb- humanitarian factors and -lrb- 3 -rrb- keeping up relations with the usa .
number three clearly over rides the first two .
why are they so fussy about wmd now ?
the case was always false and the reasons many labour and tory mps voted for it are beyond belief .
mike , south oxfordshire i 'm so glad about this .
now tony must open a larger , meaningful inquiry , as there 's no point running one which only has the backing of the people who should be under investigation .
sam gibson , aberdeen , uk the failure to disclose all details of the war in iraq can only alienate the voters and add to their suspicions .
d. mcmichael , scotland is n't it good to see the conservatives following the lead of the lib dems for a change ?
better late than never i suppose .

the party leader , michael howard , has said lord butler had chosen to examine the evidence in an unacceptably restricted fashion .
the liberal democrats had refused to take part from the beginning , saying the terms of reference were too narrow .
it comes amidst the claims by former cabinet minister clare short that british spies had been involved in bugging un secretary general kofi annan .
what 's your view on the case for the iraq war ?
are the conservative party right to pull out of the butler inquiry ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue nick , london , uk i vehemently opposed the war .
however the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue - they are even more into kow-towing to the usa than tony and co .
there 's absolutely no doubt in my mind that they would have gone to war in iraq on at least as flimsy a pretext as labour did .
nick , london , uk i think time will only tell whether it was worth it or not and the people will be better expressing their views at a general election .
let 's move on , i am bored with the whole thing and these inquires are just being used by claire and other left wing extremists for personal gain and revenge !
martin , north england this inquiry is going to be a whitewash like the last , and rather then face a public backlash the tories have decided to do the sensible thing and withdraw .
mr blair can no longer hide behind these inquiries , he must come out , face the public , and tell us why he really took our country and our troops to an illegal war .
ahmed saeed , glasgow , scotland i think the conservatives made a blunder in allowing this discredited government to hoodwink them into joining this sham of an inquiry in the first place .
after hutton , they should have known better !
however , at least they are getting out now and butler will be written off before it even delivers its whitewash .
richard , kidderminster , england good on them .
i am a labour supporter , but i am becoming more and more ashamed where tony blair and his friends are leading the institution of labour .
the founding fathers must be turning in their graves .
boh , manchester demands for the publication of the attorney general 's ruling , clare short on the rampage and now michael howard announces the tories are withdrawing from the wmd inquiry .
it smacks of opportunism but then he 's good at that .
peter haymes , felixstowe we all know the answer to whether the war was legal or not .
i am not a conservative supporter but welcome their move .
tony blair will never have another vote from me .
jamie , glasgow i believe it was totally wrong to go to war over iraq .
our political system must be modernised to stop dictatorial politicians who contemptuously dismiss the will of the people .
all of our political parties promote elected dictatorship and it 's ' time for change ' !
brian langfield , yorkshire , uk the tory party is correct to distance itself from this inquiry .
this labour government has lost all credibility at home and is fast losing it abroad .
a full and independent public inquiry to investigate the case and legality for the iraq war is now required .
nothing else will do .
robin prior , burnham-on-crouch , uk by broadening the inquiry it 's obvious that all the tories want to do is target individuals and specifically tony blair .
it would be nice if for a change they actually came up with something interesting and relevant than to just keep going on about how bad blair is etc etc .
do something interesting and maybe you 'll get voted for .
rob brennan , barnstaple the war was illegal .
it violated international laws , it was in contravention of combative rules of engagement , it does not constitute a " just war " , and every day as an occupying force we are continuing to commit this crime .
the conservative party are right to pull out , but they should never have been in it in the first place .
blair and bush must both resign and be prosecuted for their acts .
tom franklin , london , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition misbah , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition .
after the hutton report anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that this would be an even bigger fit-up .
well done the lib-dems for immediately smelling the stench of pure corruption which is emanating from this government and welcome to reality to the tory party !
misbah , uk good move by the tories .
people will rightly question the government 's position now and the terms of reference they gave butler .
mr blair now has many questions to answer and this debate will rumble on for a while yet .
jon lewis , cardiff , wales , uk the lib dems , who taunt those who reconsider a position after closer examination of facts , ought to remember the riposte : " i , sir , when i find that i had been wrong , promptly change my mind .
you , sir , what do you do ? "
hugh , london , england personally i am disgusted that politicians just regard us all as idiots to be duped when it suits them .
but of course as usual the last people to be found guilty of lying to those that they " serve " will be the politicians .
after all they never lie and are never wrong , are they ?
hutton " proved " that .
nm , uk butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw james rae , london england butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw and hopefully this will either rubbish the enquiry before it 's even published its report , or the terms of reference will be changed to broaden the brief and allow the truth to come out .
james rae , london england what is the point of this inquiry ?
it is clearly just window dressing .
furthermore , like hutton , it gets the relevant individuals off the hook so they do n't have to answer questions -lrb- yet again -rrb- , it 's full of spin and pr like everything from this government , and it 's going to cost me personally a lot of money -lrb- yet again -rrb- .
i 'm really not impressed .
alan marson , birmingham , england i am surprised that the tories are pulling out of the enquiry .
their actions are unlikely to force any kind of change to the enquiry 's terms of reference and will leave them in a weaker position with regard to getting at tony blair .
perhaps michael howard has decided to sit back and let bbc journalists prize the prime minister out of office , as they surely will .
howard , manchester , uk i fully support michael howard 's courageous and honourable decision .
the butler inquiry will be " iraq whitewash 2 " , a waste of time and public money .
the only purpose that the butler inquiry now serves is as part of the beleaguered campaign to re-elect tony blair .
mike white , london , england let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short john hammond , oxford , uk let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short .
the public can decide which enquiry goes into the details we want to know i.e. why did we " really " go to war ... was it economic reasons , wmd 's or an instruction from israel ?
john hammond , oxford , uk the tories have had a terrible time on iraq from the moment they gave blair support in waging george bush 's illegal war .
the lib dems are the only party coming out of this looking good .
but by saying that mates can stay on the committee in a personal capacity if he wants to , michael howard is taking a bad situation and making it embarrassingly worse .
we 're back in ids territory here - it 'll be okay as long as you 're emphatic every time you change your mind !
duncan hothersall , edinburgh , scotland tony blair 's insistence that there were wmd and that the british intelligence was correct makes him look like a fool .
he must face the facts and instigate an inquiry into how the government and the intelligence services got everything so horribly wrong .
blair should and must resign .
william hoggarth , loughborough , uk there was never a case for war on iraq based on wmd ... oil for the usa yes , a threat to global security i do n't think so !
if the enquiry now consists of just labour members & one tory , -lrb- if michael mates stays on it -rrb- , who does n't represent the tory party , then the enquiry should stop .
oh and then we should have another enquiry into why the enquiry went wrong !
david may , glossop england it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone mark h , uk it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone , saddam has been ousted -lrb- no-one can deny that that is a good thing ... -rrb- and now we rattle on about whether it was legal or not .
why waste time discussing it ?
if , as many people believe , blair was wrong and if , as many people believe , he lied , then the answer is simple .
have the courage of your convictions and do n't vote for blair at the next election .
then you will have had your say .
mark h , uk the conservatives -lrb- like the lib dems -rrb- are starting to sense that the public is getting tired of their exploiting the difficulties surrounding the war in iraq for their own political gain .
can we now begin to discuss what the state of things would be if no action had been taken in iraq ?
mark , wales mr howard has illustrated very graphically that the purpose of these inquiries is nothing to do with a search for truth and enlightenment , but is entirely political from both sides .
tony , liverpool the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no differente nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey there is little point in having an " inquiry " when it is set up , and has its terms of reference set , by the defence ... again .
the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no different and the opposition parties are right to have absolutely nothing to do with it .
nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey are the tories becoming an opposition ?
if they are then it 's about time .
barry , godalming uk whatever ones views on the rights or wrongs of going to war one thing is certain the conservative party have not come out of it in a good light .
unlike the lib dems the conservatives supported the war and at times were more " hawkish " than the government .
the war was clearly unpopular with the general public and the tories are now trying to backtrack - it wo n't wash !
they have little to attack the government on the home front and are now resorting to this , it strikes at desperation !
the election when it comes will be fought on domestic issues and the conservatives know they will have no chance then !
iain d monaghan , uk what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
richard , uk absolutely right , what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
just bring on the elections and lets get rid of labour and poodle blair !
richard , uk we should all be proud of our armed forces and the uk 's role in removing a vicious dictator who tortured and murdered his own people .
the victims of saddam seem to have been forgotten by the anti-war , anti-government brigade .
david morris , brecon uk the truth is out there !
it 's just we 'll never find it ...
rob , uk bearing in mind the very restricted nature of the remit is it any surprise ?
this enquiry is not what the public want .
they want a real inquiry as to why we went to war , not an enquiry into the processes involved in making that decision .
clearly there is considerable public unrest as to how the decisions were made , by whom and on what information .
terry , epsom , england if it is restricted , all we can look forward to is millions of pounds of wasted taxpayers ' money and a hefty document at the end of it that says nothing , criticises nobody , fails to answer any of the main issues and simply raises a whole new set of questions .
it 's only achievement will be to take the heat off the government for a few months whilst the storm dies down .
something we 've seen rather a lot of recently .
martin , london , uk will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk people praised robin cook for pulling out from the government before the war and accused clare short of disingenuousness for leaving after the events .
will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part in whitewash part ii and scorn michael howard and the conservatives for supporting , then withdrawing from this alleged enquiry when they realised they could not get any political gain from it ?
pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk the issue is being cleverly fudged .
saddam is an evil swine and had to be brought down .
however , were the country and the house of commons misled by the prime minister ?
surely , that is the question that needs answering by an inquiry , and it is a resigning issue .
tim sudbury , walpole st peter , norfolk michael howard is playing party politics here , just like the lib dems .
i am disappointed , being a tory voter , because i thought michael howard would get away from this sort of destructive point scoring .
surely the perception of politics & politicians in the uk has hit rock bottom by now ?
roger morgan freedlan , whitwick , england the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here mike , south oxfordshire the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here .
considering my tory mp said , in a reply to my request to vote against going to war , that there were three reasons why we should go to war : -lrb- 1 -rrb- wmd -lrb- 2 -rrb- humanitarian factors and -lrb- 3 -rrb- keeping up relations with the usa .
number three clearly over rides the first two .
why are they so fussy about wmd now ?
the case was always false and the reasons many labour and tory mps voted for it are beyond belief .
mike , south oxfordshire i 'm so glad about this .
now tony must open a larger , meaningful inquiry , as there 's no point running one which only has the backing of the people who should be under investigation .

the party leader , michael howard , has said lord butler had chosen to examine the evidence in an unacceptably restricted fashion .
the liberal democrats had refused to take part from the beginning , saying the terms of reference were too narrow .
it comes amidst the claims by former cabinet minister clare short that british spies had been involved in bugging un secretary general kofi annan .
what 's your view on the case for the iraq war ?
are the conservative party right to pull out of the butler inquiry ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue nick , london , uk i vehemently opposed the war .
however the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue - they are even more into kow-towing to the usa than tony and co .
there 's absolutely no doubt in my mind that they would have gone to war in iraq on at least as flimsy a pretext as labour did .
nick , london , uk i think time will only tell whether it was worth it or not and the people will be better expressing their views at a general election .
let 's move on , i am bored with the whole thing and these inquires are just being used by claire and other left wing extremists for personal gain and revenge !
martin , north england this inquiry is going to be a whitewash like the last , and rather then face a public backlash the tories have decided to do the sensible thing and withdraw .
mr blair can no longer hide behind these inquiries , he must come out , face the public , and tell us why he really took our country and our troops to an illegal war .
ahmed saeed , glasgow , scotland i think the conservatives made a blunder in allowing this discredited government to hoodwink them into joining this sham of an inquiry in the first place .
after hutton , they should have known better !
however , at least they are getting out now and butler will be written off before it even delivers its whitewash .
richard , kidderminster , england good on them .
i am a labour supporter , but i am becoming more and more ashamed where tony blair and his friends are leading the institution of labour .
the founding fathers must be turning in their graves .
boh , manchester demands for the publication of the attorney general 's ruling , clare short on the rampage and now michael howard announces the tories are withdrawing from the wmd inquiry .
it smacks of opportunism but then he 's good at that .
peter haymes , felixstowe we all know the answer to whether the war was legal or not .
i am not a conservative supporter but welcome their move .
tony blair will never have another vote from me .
jamie , glasgow i believe it was totally wrong to go to war over iraq .
our political system must be modernised to stop dictatorial politicians who contemptuously dismiss the will of the people .
all of our political parties promote elected dictatorship and it 's ' time for change ' !
brian langfield , yorkshire , uk the tory party is correct to distance itself from this inquiry .
this labour government has lost all credibility at home and is fast losing it abroad .
a full and independent public inquiry to investigate the case and legality for the iraq war is now required .
nothing else will do .
robin prior , burnham-on-crouch , uk by broadening the inquiry it 's obvious that all the tories want to do is target individuals and specifically tony blair .
it would be nice if for a change they actually came up with something interesting and relevant than to just keep going on about how bad blair is etc etc .
do something interesting and maybe you 'll get voted for .
rob brennan , barnstaple the war was illegal .
it violated international laws , it was in contravention of combative rules of engagement , it does not constitute a " just war " , and every day as an occupying force we are continuing to commit this crime .
the conservative party are right to pull out , but they should never have been in it in the first place .
blair and bush must both resign and be prosecuted for their acts .
tom franklin , london , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition misbah , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition .
after the hutton report anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that this would be an even bigger fit-up .
well done the lib-dems for immediately smelling the stench of pure corruption which is emanating from this government and welcome to reality to the tory party !
misbah , uk good move by the tories .
people will rightly question the government 's position now and the terms of reference they gave butler .
mr blair now has many questions to answer and this debate will rumble on for a while yet .
jon lewis , cardiff , wales , uk the lib dems , who taunt those who reconsider a position after closer examination of facts , ought to remember the riposte : " i , sir , when i find that i had been wrong , promptly change my mind .
you , sir , what do you do ? "
hugh , london , england personally i am disgusted that politicians just regard us all as idiots to be duped when it suits them .
but of course as usual the last people to be found guilty of lying to those that they " serve " will be the politicians .
after all they never lie and are never wrong , are they ?
hutton " proved " that .
nm , uk butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw james rae , london england butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw and hopefully this will either rubbish the enquiry before it 's even published its report , or the terms of reference will be changed to broaden the brief and allow the truth to come out .
james rae , london england what is the point of this inquiry ?
it is clearly just window dressing .
furthermore , like hutton , it gets the relevant individuals off the hook so they do n't have to answer questions -lrb- yet again -rrb- , it 's full of spin and pr like everything from this government , and it 's going to cost me personally a lot of money -lrb- yet again -rrb- .
i 'm really not impressed .
alan marson , birmingham , england i am surprised that the tories are pulling out of the enquiry .
their actions are unlikely to force any kind of change to the enquiry 's terms of reference and will leave them in a weaker position with regard to getting at tony blair .
perhaps michael howard has decided to sit back and let bbc journalists prize the prime minister out of office , as they surely will .
howard , manchester , uk i fully support michael howard 's courageous and honourable decision .
the butler inquiry will be " iraq whitewash 2 " , a waste of time and public money .
the only purpose that the butler inquiry now serves is as part of the beleaguered campaign to re-elect tony blair .
mike white , london , england let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short john hammond , oxford , uk let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short .
the public can decide which enquiry goes into the details we want to know i.e. why did we " really " go to war ... was it economic reasons , wmd 's or an instruction from israel ?
john hammond , oxford , uk the tories have had a terrible time on iraq from the moment they gave blair support in waging george bush 's illegal war .
the lib dems are the only party coming out of this looking good .
but by saying that mates can stay on the committee in a personal capacity if he wants to , michael howard is taking a bad situation and making it embarrassingly worse .
we 're back in ids territory here - it 'll be okay as long as you 're emphatic every time you change your mind !
duncan hothersall , edinburgh , scotland tony blair 's insistence that there were wmd and that the british intelligence was correct makes him look like a fool .
he must face the facts and instigate an inquiry into how the government and the intelligence services got everything so horribly wrong .
blair should and must resign .
william hoggarth , loughborough , uk there was never a case for war on iraq based on wmd ... oil for the usa yes , a threat to global security i do n't think so !
if the enquiry now consists of just labour members & one tory , -lrb- if michael mates stays on it -rrb- , who does n't represent the tory party , then the enquiry should stop .
oh and then we should have another enquiry into why the enquiry went wrong !
david may , glossop england it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone mark h , uk it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone , saddam has been ousted -lrb- no-one can deny that that is a good thing ... -rrb- and now we rattle on about whether it was legal or not .
why waste time discussing it ?
if , as many people believe , blair was wrong and if , as many people believe , he lied , then the answer is simple .
have the courage of your convictions and do n't vote for blair at the next election .
then you will have had your say .
mark h , uk the conservatives -lrb- like the lib dems -rrb- are starting to sense that the public is getting tired of their exploiting the difficulties surrounding the war in iraq for their own political gain .
can we now begin to discuss what the state of things would be if no action had been taken in iraq ?
mark , wales mr howard has illustrated very graphically that the purpose of these inquiries is nothing to do with a search for truth and enlightenment , but is entirely political from both sides .
tony , liverpool the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no differente nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey there is little point in having an " inquiry " when it is set up , and has its terms of reference set , by the defence ... again .
the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no different and the opposition parties are right to have absolutely nothing to do with it .
nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey are the tories becoming an opposition ?
if they are then it 's about time .
barry , godalming uk whatever ones views on the rights or wrongs of going to war one thing is certain the conservative party have not come out of it in a good light .
unlike the lib dems the conservatives supported the war and at times were more " hawkish " than the government .
the war was clearly unpopular with the general public and the tories are now trying to backtrack - it wo n't wash !
they have little to attack the government on the home front and are now resorting to this , it strikes at desperation !
the election when it comes will be fought on domestic issues and the conservatives know they will have no chance then !
iain d monaghan , uk what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
richard , uk absolutely right , what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
just bring on the elections and lets get rid of labour and poodle blair !
richard , uk we should all be proud of our armed forces and the uk 's role in removing a vicious dictator who tortured and murdered his own people .
the victims of saddam seem to have been forgotten by the anti-war , anti-government brigade .
david morris , brecon uk the truth is out there !
it 's just we 'll never find it ...
rob , uk bearing in mind the very restricted nature of the remit is it any surprise ?
this enquiry is not what the public want .
they want a real inquiry as to why we went to war , not an enquiry into the processes involved in making that decision .
clearly there is considerable public unrest as to how the decisions were made , by whom and on what information .
terry , epsom , england if it is restricted , all we can look forward to is millions of pounds of wasted taxpayers ' money and a hefty document at the end of it that says nothing , criticises nobody , fails to answer any of the main issues and simply raises a whole new set of questions .
it 's only achievement will be to take the heat off the government for a few months whilst the storm dies down .
something we 've seen rather a lot of recently .
martin , london , uk will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk people praised robin cook for pulling out from the government before the war and accused clare short of disingenuousness for leaving after the events .
will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part in whitewash part ii and scorn michael howard and the conservatives for supporting , then withdrawing from this alleged enquiry when they realised they could not get any political gain from it ?
pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk the issue is being cleverly fudged .
saddam is an evil swine and had to be brought down .
however , were the country and the house of commons misled by the prime minister ?
surely , that is the question that needs answering by an inquiry , and it is a resigning issue .
tim sudbury , walpole st peter , norfolk michael howard is playing party politics here , just like the lib dems .
i am disappointed , being a tory voter , because i thought michael howard would get away from this sort of destructive point scoring .
surely the perception of politics & politicians in the uk has hit rock bottom by now ?
roger morgan freedlan , whitwick , england the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here mike , south oxfordshire the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here .
considering my tory mp said , in a reply to my request to vote against going to war , that there were three reasons why we should go to war : -lrb- 1 -rrb- wmd -lrb- 2 -rrb- humanitarian factors and -lrb- 3 -rrb- keeping up relations with the usa .
number three clearly over rides the first two .
why are they so fussy about wmd now ?
the case was always false and the reasons many labour and tory mps voted for it are beyond belief .
mike , south oxfordshire i 'm so glad about this .
now tony must open a larger , meaningful inquiry , as there 's no point running one which only has the backing of the people who should be under investigation .
sam gibson , aberdeen , uk the failure to disclose all details of the war in iraq can only alienate the voters and add to their suspicions .
d. mcmichael , scotland is n't it good to see the conservatives following the lead of the lib dems for a change ?
better late than never i suppose .

the party leader , michael howard , has said lord butler had chosen to examine the evidence in an unacceptably restricted fashion .
the liberal democrats had refused to take part from the beginning , saying the terms of reference were too narrow .
it comes amidst the claims by former cabinet minister clare short that british spies had been involved in bugging un secretary general kofi annan .
what 's your view on the case for the iraq war ?
are the conservative party right to pull out of the butler inquiry ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue nick , london , uk i vehemently opposed the war .
however the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue - they are even more into kow-towing to the usa than tony and co .
there 's absolutely no doubt in my mind that they would have gone to war in iraq on at least as flimsy a pretext as labour did .
nick , london , uk i think time will only tell whether it was worth it or not and the people will be better expressing their views at a general election .
let 's move on , i am bored with the whole thing and these inquires are just being used by claire and other left wing extremists for personal gain and revenge !
martin , north england this inquiry is going to be a whitewash like the last , and rather then face a public backlash the tories have decided to do the sensible thing and withdraw .
mr blair can no longer hide behind these inquiries , he must come out , face the public , and tell us why he really took our country and our troops to an illegal war .
ahmed saeed , glasgow , scotland i think the conservatives made a blunder in allowing this discredited government to hoodwink them into joining this sham of an inquiry in the first place .
after hutton , they should have known better !
however , at least they are getting out now and butler will be written off before it even delivers its whitewash .
richard , kidderminster , england good on them .
i am a labour supporter , but i am becoming more and more ashamed where tony blair and his friends are leading the institution of labour .
the founding fathers must be turning in their graves .
boh , manchester demands for the publication of the attorney general 's ruling , clare short on the rampage and now michael howard announces the tories are withdrawing from the wmd inquiry .
it smacks of opportunism but then he 's good at that .
peter haymes , felixstowe we all know the answer to whether the war was legal or not .
i am not a conservative supporter but welcome their move .
tony blair will never have another vote from me .
jamie , glasgow i believe it was totally wrong to go to war over iraq .
our political system must be modernised to stop dictatorial politicians who contemptuously dismiss the will of the people .
all of our political parties promote elected dictatorship and it 's ' time for change ' !
brian langfield , yorkshire , uk the tory party is correct to distance itself from this inquiry .
this labour government has lost all credibility at home and is fast losing it abroad .
a full and independent public inquiry to investigate the case and legality for the iraq war is now required .
nothing else will do .
robin prior , burnham-on-crouch , uk by broadening the inquiry it 's obvious that all the tories want to do is target individuals and specifically tony blair .
it would be nice if for a change they actually came up with something interesting and relevant than to just keep going on about how bad blair is etc etc .
do something interesting and maybe you 'll get voted for .
rob brennan , barnstaple the war was illegal .
it violated international laws , it was in contravention of combative rules of engagement , it does not constitute a " just war " , and every day as an occupying force we are continuing to commit this crime .
the conservative party are right to pull out , but they should never have been in it in the first place .
blair and bush must both resign and be prosecuted for their acts .
tom franklin , london , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition misbah , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition .
after the hutton report anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that this would be an even bigger fit-up .
well done the lib-dems for immediately smelling the stench of pure corruption which is emanating from this government and welcome to reality to the tory party !
misbah , uk good move by the tories .
people will rightly question the government 's position now and the terms of reference they gave butler .
mr blair now has many questions to answer and this debate will rumble on for a while yet .
jon lewis , cardiff , wales , uk the lib dems , who taunt those who reconsider a position after closer examination of facts , ought to remember the riposte : " i , sir , when i find that i had been wrong , promptly change my mind .
you , sir , what do you do ? "
hugh , london , england personally i am disgusted that politicians just regard us all as idiots to be duped when it suits them .
but of course as usual the last people to be found guilty of lying to those that they " serve " will be the politicians .
after all they never lie and are never wrong , are they ?
hutton " proved " that .
nm , uk butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw james rae , london england butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw and hopefully this will either rubbish the enquiry before it 's even published its report , or the terms of reference will be changed to broaden the brief and allow the truth to come out .
james rae , london england what is the point of this inquiry ?
it is clearly just window dressing .
furthermore , like hutton , it gets the relevant individuals off the hook so they do n't have to answer questions -lrb- yet again -rrb- , it 's full of spin and pr like everything from this government , and it 's going to cost me personally a lot of money -lrb- yet again -rrb- .
i 'm really not impressed .
alan marson , birmingham , england i am surprised that the tories are pulling out of the enquiry .
their actions are unlikely to force any kind of change to the enquiry 's terms of reference and will leave them in a weaker position with regard to getting at tony blair .
perhaps michael howard has decided to sit back and let bbc journalists prize the prime minister out of office , as they surely will .
howard , manchester , uk i fully support michael howard 's courageous and honourable decision .
the butler inquiry will be " iraq whitewash 2 " , a waste of time and public money .
the only purpose that the butler inquiry now serves is as part of the beleaguered campaign to re-elect tony blair .
mike white , london , england let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short john hammond , oxford , uk let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short .
the public can decide which enquiry goes into the details we want to know i.e. why did we " really " go to war ... was it economic reasons , wmd 's or an instruction from israel ?
john hammond , oxford , uk the tories have had a terrible time on iraq from the moment they gave blair support in waging george bush 's illegal war .
the lib dems are the only party coming out of this looking good .
but by saying that mates can stay on the committee in a personal capacity if he wants to , michael howard is taking a bad situation and making it embarrassingly worse .
we 're back in ids territory here - it 'll be okay as long as you 're emphatic every time you change your mind !
duncan hothersall , edinburgh , scotland tony blair 's insistence that there were wmd and that the british intelligence was correct makes him look like a fool .
he must face the facts and instigate an inquiry into how the government and the intelligence services got everything so horribly wrong .
blair should and must resign .
william hoggarth , loughborough , uk there was never a case for war on iraq based on wmd ... oil for the usa yes , a threat to global security i do n't think so !
if the enquiry now consists of just labour members & one tory , -lrb- if michael mates stays on it -rrb- , who does n't represent the tory party , then the enquiry should stop .
oh and then we should have another enquiry into why the enquiry went wrong !
david may , glossop england it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone mark h , uk it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone , saddam has been ousted -lrb- no-one can deny that that is a good thing ... -rrb- and now we rattle on about whether it was legal or not .
why waste time discussing it ?
if , as many people believe , blair was wrong and if , as many people believe , he lied , then the answer is simple .
have the courage of your convictions and do n't vote for blair at the next election .
then you will have had your say .
mark h , uk the conservatives -lrb- like the lib dems -rrb- are starting to sense that the public is getting tired of their exploiting the difficulties surrounding the war in iraq for their own political gain .
can we now begin to discuss what the state of things would be if no action had been taken in iraq ?
mark , wales mr howard has illustrated very graphically that the purpose of these inquiries is nothing to do with a search for truth and enlightenment , but is entirely political from both sides .
tony , liverpool the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no differente nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey there is little point in having an " inquiry " when it is set up , and has its terms of reference set , by the defence ... again .
the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no different and the opposition parties are right to have absolutely nothing to do with it .
nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey are the tories becoming an opposition ?
if they are then it 's about time .
barry , godalming uk whatever ones views on the rights or wrongs of going to war one thing is certain the conservative party have not come out of it in a good light .
unlike the lib dems the conservatives supported the war and at times were more " hawkish " than the government .
the war was clearly unpopular with the general public and the tories are now trying to backtrack - it wo n't wash !
they have little to attack the government on the home front and are now resorting to this , it strikes at desperation !
the election when it comes will be fought on domestic issues and the conservatives know they will have no chance then !
iain d monaghan , uk what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
richard , uk absolutely right , what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
just bring on the elections and lets get rid of labour and poodle blair !
richard , uk we should all be proud of our armed forces and the uk 's role in removing a vicious dictator who tortured and murdered his own people .
the victims of saddam seem to have been forgotten by the anti-war , anti-government brigade .
david morris , brecon uk the truth is out there !
it 's just we 'll never find it ...
rob , uk bearing in mind the very restricted nature of the remit is it any surprise ?
this enquiry is not what the public want .
they want a real inquiry as to why we went to war , not an enquiry into the processes involved in making that decision .
clearly there is considerable public unrest as to how the decisions were made , by whom and on what information .
terry , epsom , england if it is restricted , all we can look forward to is millions of pounds of wasted taxpayers ' money and a hefty document at the end of it that says nothing , criticises nobody , fails to answer any of the main issues and simply raises a whole new set of questions .
it 's only achievement will be to take the heat off the government for a few months whilst the storm dies down .
something we 've seen rather a lot of recently .
martin , london , uk will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk people praised robin cook for pulling out from the government before the war and accused clare short of disingenuousness for leaving after the events .
will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part in whitewash part ii and scorn michael howard and the conservatives for supporting , then withdrawing from this alleged enquiry when they realised they could not get any political gain from it ?
pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk the issue is being cleverly fudged .
saddam is an evil swine and had to be brought down .
however , were the country and the house of commons misled by the prime minister ?
surely , that is the question that needs answering by an inquiry , and it is a resigning issue .
tim sudbury , walpole st peter , norfolk michael howard is playing party politics here , just like the lib dems .
i am disappointed , being a tory voter , because i thought michael howard would get away from this sort of destructive point scoring .
surely the perception of politics & politicians in the uk has hit rock bottom by now ?
roger morgan freedlan , whitwick , england the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here mike , south oxfordshire the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here .
considering my tory mp said , in a reply to my request to vote against going to war , that there were three reasons why we should go to war : -lrb- 1 -rrb- wmd -lrb- 2 -rrb- humanitarian factors and -lrb- 3 -rrb- keeping up relations with the usa .
number three clearly over rides the first two .
why are they so fussy about wmd now ?
the case was always false and the reasons many labour and tory mps voted for it are beyond belief .
mike , south oxfordshire i 'm so glad about this .
now tony must open a larger , meaningful inquiry , as there 's no point running one which only has the backing of the people who should be under investigation .
sam gibson , aberdeen , uk the failure to disclose all details of the war in iraq can only alienate the voters and add to their suspicions .
d. mcmichael , scotland is n't it good to see the conservatives following the lead of the lib dems for a change ?
better late than never i suppose .
gerry noble , salisbury , uk e-mail this to a friend printable version hunt for iraq 's wmd have your say iraq report buck ' stops with pm ' cia slated over iraq intelligence wmd may never be found - blair tories quit wmd inquiry probe ' to focus on systems ' a bumpy week nick assinder looks ahead to a difficult week for tony blair .

the party leader , michael howard , has said lord butler had chosen to examine the evidence in an unacceptably restricted fashion .
the liberal democrats had refused to take part from the beginning , saying the terms of reference were too narrow .
it comes amidst the claims by former cabinet minister clare short that british spies had been involved in bugging un secretary general kofi annan .
what 's your view on the case for the iraq war ?
are the conservative party right to pull out of the butler inquiry ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue nick , london , uk i vehemently opposed the war .
however the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue - they are even more into kow-towing to the usa than tony and co .
there 's absolutely no doubt in my mind that they would have gone to war in iraq on at least as flimsy a pretext as labour did .
nick , london , uk i think time will only tell whether it was worth it or not and the people will be better expressing their views at a general election .
let 's move on , i am bored with the whole thing and these inquires are just being used by claire and other left wing extremists for personal gain and revenge !
martin , north england this inquiry is going to be a whitewash like the last , and rather then face a public backlash the tories have decided to do the sensible thing and withdraw .
mr blair can no longer hide behind these inquiries , he must come out , face the public , and tell us why he really took our country and our troops to an illegal war .
ahmed saeed , glasgow , scotland i think the conservatives made a blunder in allowing this discredited government to hoodwink them into joining this sham of an inquiry in the first place .
after hutton , they should have known better !
however , at least they are getting out now and butler will be written off before it even delivers its whitewash .
richard , kidderminster , england good on them .
i am a labour supporter , but i am becoming more and more ashamed where tony blair and his friends are leading the institution of labour .
the founding fathers must be turning in their graves .
boh , manchester demands for the publication of the attorney general 's ruling , clare short on the rampage and now michael howard announces the tories are withdrawing from the wmd inquiry .
it smacks of opportunism but then he 's good at that .
peter haymes , felixstowe we all know the answer to whether the war was legal or not .
i am not a conservative supporter but welcome their move .
tony blair will never have another vote from me .
jamie , glasgow i believe it was totally wrong to go to war over iraq .
our political system must be modernised to stop dictatorial politicians who contemptuously dismiss the will of the people .
all of our political parties promote elected dictatorship and it 's ' time for change ' !
brian langfield , yorkshire , uk the tory party is correct to distance itself from this inquiry .
this labour government has lost all credibility at home and is fast losing it abroad .
a full and independent public inquiry to investigate the case and legality for the iraq war is now required .
nothing else will do .
robin prior , burnham-on-crouch , uk by broadening the inquiry it 's obvious that all the tories want to do is target individuals and specifically tony blair .
it would be nice if for a change they actually came up with something interesting and relevant than to just keep going on about how bad blair is etc etc .
do something interesting and maybe you 'll get voted for .
rob brennan , barnstaple the war was illegal .
it violated international laws , it was in contravention of combative rules of engagement , it does not constitute a " just war " , and every day as an occupying force we are continuing to commit this crime .
the conservative party are right to pull out , but they should never have been in it in the first place .
blair and bush must both resign and be prosecuted for their acts .
tom franklin , london , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition misbah , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition .
after the hutton report anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that this would be an even bigger fit-up .
well done the lib-dems for immediately smelling the stench of pure corruption which is emanating from this government and welcome to reality to the tory party !
misbah , uk good move by the tories .
people will rightly question the government 's position now and the terms of reference they gave butler .
mr blair now has many questions to answer and this debate will rumble on for a while yet .
jon lewis , cardiff , wales , uk the lib dems , who taunt those who reconsider a position after closer examination of facts , ought to remember the riposte : " i , sir , when i find that i had been wrong , promptly change my mind .
you , sir , what do you do ? "
hugh , london , england personally i am disgusted that politicians just regard us all as idiots to be duped when it suits them .
but of course as usual the last people to be found guilty of lying to those that they " serve " will be the politicians .
after all they never lie and are never wrong , are they ?
hutton " proved " that .
nm , uk butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw james rae , london england butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw and hopefully this will either rubbish the enquiry before it 's even published its report , or the terms of reference will be changed to broaden the brief and allow the truth to come out .
james rae , london england what is the point of this inquiry ?
it is clearly just window dressing .
furthermore , like hutton , it gets the relevant individuals off the hook so they do n't have to answer questions -lrb- yet again -rrb- , it 's full of spin and pr like everything from this government , and it 's going to cost me personally a lot of money -lrb- yet again -rrb- .
i 'm really not impressed .
alan marson , birmingham , england i am surprised that the tories are pulling out of the enquiry .
their actions are unlikely to force any kind of change to the enquiry 's terms of reference and will leave them in a weaker position with regard to getting at tony blair .
perhaps michael howard has decided to sit back and let bbc journalists prize the prime minister out of office , as they surely will .
howard , manchester , uk i fully support michael howard 's courageous and honourable decision .
the butler inquiry will be " iraq whitewash 2 " , a waste of time and public money .
the only purpose that the butler inquiry now serves is as part of the beleaguered campaign to re-elect tony blair .
mike white , london , england let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short john hammond , oxford , uk let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short .
the public can decide which enquiry goes into the details we want to know i.e. why did we " really " go to war ... was it economic reasons , wmd 's or an instruction from israel ?
john hammond , oxford , uk the tories have had a terrible time on iraq from the moment they gave blair support in waging george bush 's illegal war .
the lib dems are the only party coming out of this looking good .
but by saying that mates can stay on the committee in a personal capacity if he wants to , michael howard is taking a bad situation and making it embarrassingly worse .
we 're back in ids territory here - it 'll be okay as long as you 're emphatic every time you change your mind !
duncan hothersall , edinburgh , scotland tony blair 's insistence that there were wmd and that the british intelligence was correct makes him look like a fool .
he must face the facts and instigate an inquiry into how the government and the intelligence services got everything so horribly wrong .
blair should and must resign .
william hoggarth , loughborough , uk there was never a case for war on iraq based on wmd ... oil for the usa yes , a threat to global security i do n't think so !
if the enquiry now consists of just labour members & one tory , -lrb- if michael mates stays on it -rrb- , who does n't represent the tory party , then the enquiry should stop .
oh and then we should have another enquiry into why the enquiry went wrong !
david may , glossop england it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone mark h , uk it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone , saddam has been ousted -lrb- no-one can deny that that is a good thing ... -rrb- and now we rattle on about whether it was legal or not .
why waste time discussing it ?
if , as many people believe , blair was wrong and if , as many people believe , he lied , then the answer is simple .
have the courage of your convictions and do n't vote for blair at the next election .
then you will have had your say .
mark h , uk the conservatives -lrb- like the lib dems -rrb- are starting to sense that the public is getting tired of their exploiting the difficulties surrounding the war in iraq for their own political gain .
can we now begin to discuss what the state of things would be if no action had been taken in iraq ?
mark , wales mr howard has illustrated very graphically that the purpose of these inquiries is nothing to do with a search for truth and enlightenment , but is entirely political from both sides .
tony , liverpool the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no differente nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey there is little point in having an " inquiry " when it is set up , and has its terms of reference set , by the defence ... again .
the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no different and the opposition parties are right to have absolutely nothing to do with it .
nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey are the tories becoming an opposition ?
if they are then it 's about time .
barry , godalming uk whatever ones views on the rights or wrongs of going to war one thing is certain the conservative party have not come out of it in a good light .
unlike the lib dems the conservatives supported the war and at times were more " hawkish " than the government .
the war was clearly unpopular with the general public and the tories are now trying to backtrack - it wo n't wash !
they have little to attack the government on the home front and are now resorting to this , it strikes at desperation !
the election when it comes will be fought on domestic issues and the conservatives know they will have no chance then !
iain d monaghan , uk what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
richard , uk absolutely right , what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
just bring on the elections and lets get rid of labour and poodle blair !
richard , uk we should all be proud of our armed forces and the uk 's role in removing a vicious dictator who tortured and murdered his own people .
the victims of saddam seem to have been forgotten by the anti-war , anti-government brigade .
david morris , brecon uk the truth is out there !
it 's just we 'll never find it ...
rob , uk bearing in mind the very restricted nature of the remit is it any surprise ?
this enquiry is not what the public want .
they want a real inquiry as to why we went to war , not an enquiry into the processes involved in making that decision .
clearly there is considerable public unrest as to how the decisions were made , by whom and on what information .
terry , epsom , england if it is restricted , all we can look forward to is millions of pounds of wasted taxpayers ' money and a hefty document at the end of it that says nothing , criticises nobody , fails to answer any of the main issues and simply raises a whole new set of questions .
it 's only achievement will be to take the heat off the government for a few months whilst the storm dies down .
something we 've seen rather a lot of recently .
martin , london , uk will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk people praised robin cook for pulling out from the government before the war and accused clare short of disingenuousness for leaving after the events .
will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part in whitewash part ii and scorn michael howard and the conservatives for supporting , then withdrawing from this alleged enquiry when they realised they could not get any political gain from it ?
pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk the issue is being cleverly fudged .
saddam is an evil swine and had to be brought down .
however , were the country and the house of commons misled by the prime minister ?
surely , that is the question that needs answering by an inquiry , and it is a resigning issue .
tim sudbury , walpole st peter , norfolk michael howard is playing party politics here , just like the lib dems .
i am disappointed , being a tory voter , because i thought michael howard would get away from this sort of destructive point scoring .
surely the perception of politics & politicians in the uk has hit rock bottom by now ?
roger morgan freedlan , whitwick , england the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here mike , south oxfordshire the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here .
considering my tory mp said , in a reply to my request to vote against going to war , that there were three reasons why we should go to war : -lrb- 1 -rrb- wmd -lrb- 2 -rrb- humanitarian factors and -lrb- 3 -rrb- keeping up relations with the usa .
number three clearly over rides the first two .
why are they so fussy about wmd now ?
the case was always false and the reasons many labour and tory mps voted for it are beyond belief .
mike , south oxfordshire i 'm so glad about this .
now tony must open a larger , meaningful inquiry , as there 's no point running one which only has the backing of the people who should be under investigation .
sam gibson , aberdeen , uk the failure to disclose all details of the war in iraq can only alienate the voters and add to their suspicions .
d. mcmichael , scotland is n't it good to see the conservatives following the lead of the lib dems for a change ?
better late than never i suppose .

the liberal democrats had refused to take part from the beginning , saying the terms of reference were too narrow .
it comes amidst the claims by former cabinet minister clare short that british spies had been involved in bugging un secretary general kofi annan .
what 's your view on the case for the iraq war ?
are the conservative party right to pull out of the butler inquiry ?
send us your comments .
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue nick , london , uk i vehemently opposed the war .
however the tories do n't have a leg to stand on on this issue - they are even more into kow-towing to the usa than tony and co .
there 's absolutely no doubt in my mind that they would have gone to war in iraq on at least as flimsy a pretext as labour did .
nick , london , uk i think time will only tell whether it was worth it or not and the people will be better expressing their views at a general election .
let 's move on , i am bored with the whole thing and these inquires are just being used by claire and other left wing extremists for personal gain and revenge !
martin , north england this inquiry is going to be a whitewash like the last , and rather then face a public backlash the tories have decided to do the sensible thing and withdraw .
mr blair can no longer hide behind these inquiries , he must come out , face the public , and tell us why he really took our country and our troops to an illegal war .
ahmed saeed , glasgow , scotland i think the conservatives made a blunder in allowing this discredited government to hoodwink them into joining this sham of an inquiry in the first place .
after hutton , they should have known better !
however , at least they are getting out now and butler will be written off before it even delivers its whitewash .
richard , kidderminster , england good on them .
i am a labour supporter , but i am becoming more and more ashamed where tony blair and his friends are leading the institution of labour .
the founding fathers must be turning in their graves .
boh , manchester demands for the publication of the attorney general 's ruling , clare short on the rampage and now michael howard announces the tories are withdrawing from the wmd inquiry .
it smacks of opportunism but then he 's good at that .
peter haymes , felixstowe we all know the answer to whether the war was legal or not .
i am not a conservative supporter but welcome their move .
tony blair will never have another vote from me .
jamie , glasgow i believe it was totally wrong to go to war over iraq .
our political system must be modernised to stop dictatorial politicians who contemptuously dismiss the will of the people .
all of our political parties promote elected dictatorship and it 's ' time for change ' !
brian langfield , yorkshire , uk the tory party is correct to distance itself from this inquiry .
this labour government has lost all credibility at home and is fast losing it abroad .
a full and independent public inquiry to investigate the case and legality for the iraq war is now required .
nothing else will do .
robin prior , burnham-on-crouch , uk by broadening the inquiry it 's obvious that all the tories want to do is target individuals and specifically tony blair .
it would be nice if for a change they actually came up with something interesting and relevant than to just keep going on about how bad blair is etc etc .
do something interesting and maybe you 'll get voted for .
rob brennan , barnstaple the war was illegal .
it violated international laws , it was in contravention of combative rules of engagement , it does not constitute a " just war " , and every day as an occupying force we are continuing to commit this crime .
the conservative party are right to pull out , but they should never have been in it in the first place .
blair and bush must both resign and be prosecuted for their acts .
tom franklin , london , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition misbah , uk at last - some proper direction from this lacklustre opposition .
after the hutton report anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that this would be an even bigger fit-up .
well done the lib-dems for immediately smelling the stench of pure corruption which is emanating from this government and welcome to reality to the tory party !
misbah , uk good move by the tories .
people will rightly question the government 's position now and the terms of reference they gave butler .
mr blair now has many questions to answer and this debate will rumble on for a while yet .
jon lewis , cardiff , wales , uk the lib dems , who taunt those who reconsider a position after closer examination of facts , ought to remember the riposte : " i , sir , when i find that i had been wrong , promptly change my mind .
you , sir , what do you do ? "
hugh , london , england personally i am disgusted that politicians just regard us all as idiots to be duped when it suits them .
but of course as usual the last people to be found guilty of lying to those that they " serve " will be the politicians .
after all they never lie and are never wrong , are they ?
hutton " proved " that .
nm , uk butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw james rae , london england butler 's inquiry is a means of burying unpleasant facts and the tories are right to withdraw and hopefully this will either rubbish the enquiry before it 's even published its report , or the terms of reference will be changed to broaden the brief and allow the truth to come out .
james rae , london england what is the point of this inquiry ?
it is clearly just window dressing .
furthermore , like hutton , it gets the relevant individuals off the hook so they do n't have to answer questions -lrb- yet again -rrb- , it 's full of spin and pr like everything from this government , and it 's going to cost me personally a lot of money -lrb- yet again -rrb- .
i 'm really not impressed .
alan marson , birmingham , england i am surprised that the tories are pulling out of the enquiry .
their actions are unlikely to force any kind of change to the enquiry 's terms of reference and will leave them in a weaker position with regard to getting at tony blair .
perhaps michael howard has decided to sit back and let bbc journalists prize the prime minister out of office , as they surely will .
howard , manchester , uk i fully support michael howard 's courageous and honourable decision .
the butler inquiry will be " iraq whitewash 2 " , a waste of time and public money .
the only purpose that the butler inquiry now serves is as part of the beleaguered campaign to re-elect tony blair .
mike white , london , england let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short john hammond , oxford , uk let butler have his inquiry , and let 's have another inquiry led by claire short .
the public can decide which enquiry goes into the details we want to know i.e. why did we " really " go to war ... was it economic reasons , wmd 's or an instruction from israel ?
john hammond , oxford , uk the tories have had a terrible time on iraq from the moment they gave blair support in waging george bush 's illegal war .
the lib dems are the only party coming out of this looking good .
but by saying that mates can stay on the committee in a personal capacity if he wants to , michael howard is taking a bad situation and making it embarrassingly worse .
we 're back in ids territory here - it 'll be okay as long as you 're emphatic every time you change your mind !
duncan hothersall , edinburgh , scotland tony blair 's insistence that there were wmd and that the british intelligence was correct makes him look like a fool .
he must face the facts and instigate an inquiry into how the government and the intelligence services got everything so horribly wrong .
blair should and must resign .
william hoggarth , loughborough , uk there was never a case for war on iraq based on wmd ... oil for the usa yes , a threat to global security i do n't think so !
if the enquiry now consists of just labour members & one tory , -lrb- if michael mates stays on it -rrb- , who does n't represent the tory party , then the enquiry should stop .
oh and then we should have another enquiry into why the enquiry went wrong !
david may , glossop england it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone mark h , uk it 's all a bit too late is n't it ?
the war has been and gone , saddam has been ousted -lrb- no-one can deny that that is a good thing ... -rrb- and now we rattle on about whether it was legal or not .
why waste time discussing it ?
if , as many people believe , blair was wrong and if , as many people believe , he lied , then the answer is simple .
have the courage of your convictions and do n't vote for blair at the next election .
then you will have had your say .
mark h , uk the conservatives -lrb- like the lib dems -rrb- are starting to sense that the public is getting tired of their exploiting the difficulties surrounding the war in iraq for their own political gain .
can we now begin to discuss what the state of things would be if no action had been taken in iraq ?
mark , wales mr howard has illustrated very graphically that the purpose of these inquiries is nothing to do with a search for truth and enlightenment , but is entirely political from both sides .
tony , liverpool the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no differente nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey there is little point in having an " inquiry " when it is set up , and has its terms of reference set , by the defence ... again .
the country laughed at the hutton report - this one will be no different and the opposition parties are right to have absolutely nothing to do with it .
nigel cubbage , redhill , surrey are the tories becoming an opposition ?
if they are then it 's about time .
barry , godalming uk whatever ones views on the rights or wrongs of going to war one thing is certain the conservative party have not come out of it in a good light .
unlike the lib dems the conservatives supported the war and at times were more " hawkish " than the government .
the war was clearly unpopular with the general public and the tories are now trying to backtrack - it wo n't wash !
they have little to attack the government on the home front and are now resorting to this , it strikes at desperation !
the election when it comes will be fought on domestic issues and the conservatives know they will have no chance then !
iain d monaghan , uk what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
richard , uk absolutely right , what 's the point if wasting time going through the motions when it is just another whitewash !
just bring on the elections and lets get rid of labour and poodle blair !
richard , uk we should all be proud of our armed forces and the uk 's role in removing a vicious dictator who tortured and murdered his own people .
the victims of saddam seem to have been forgotten by the anti-war , anti-government brigade .
david morris , brecon uk the truth is out there !
it 's just we 'll never find it ...
rob , uk bearing in mind the very restricted nature of the remit is it any surprise ?
this enquiry is not what the public want .
they want a real inquiry as to why we went to war , not an enquiry into the processes involved in making that decision .
clearly there is considerable public unrest as to how the decisions were made , by whom and on what information .
terry , epsom , england if it is restricted , all we can look forward to is millions of pounds of wasted taxpayers ' money and a hefty document at the end of it that says nothing , criticises nobody , fails to answer any of the main issues and simply raises a whole new set of questions .
it 's only achievement will be to take the heat off the government for a few months whilst the storm dies down .
something we 've seen rather a lot of recently .
martin , london , uk will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk people praised robin cook for pulling out from the government before the war and accused clare short of disingenuousness for leaving after the events .
will people now praise charles kennedy and the liberal democrats from refusing , right from the start , to take part in whitewash part ii and scorn michael howard and the conservatives for supporting , then withdrawing from this alleged enquiry when they realised they could not get any political gain from it ?
pascal jacquemain , welwyn garden city , uk the issue is being cleverly fudged .
saddam is an evil swine and had to be brought down .
however , were the country and the house of commons misled by the prime minister ?
surely , that is the question that needs answering by an inquiry , and it is a resigning issue .
tim sudbury , walpole st peter , norfolk michael howard is playing party politics here , just like the lib dems .
i am disappointed , being a tory voter , because i thought michael howard would get away from this sort of destructive point scoring .
surely the perception of politics & politicians in the uk has hit rock bottom by now ?
roger morgan freedlan , whitwick , england the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here mike , south oxfordshire the conservatives have a bit of a nerve to pull out here .
considering my tory mp said , in a reply to my request to vote against going to war , that there were three reasons why we should go to war : -lrb- 1 -rrb- wmd -lrb- 2 -rrb- humanitarian factors and -lrb- 3 -rrb- keeping up relations with the usa .
number three clearly over rides the first two .
why are they so fussy about wmd now ?
the case was always false and the reasons many labour and tory mps voted for it are beyond belief .
mike , south oxfordshire i 'm so glad about this .
now tony must open a larger , meaningful inquiry , as there 's no point running one which only has the backing of the people who should be under investigation .
sam gibson , aberdeen , uk the failure to disclose all details of the war in iraq can only alienate the voters and add to their suspicions .
d. mcmichael , scotland is n't it good to see the conservatives following the lead of the lib dems for a change ?
better late than never i suppose .

last year , the beamish museum said its drift mine could close unless a former pit worker could be found .
it needed to recruit a qualified pit deputy to meet health and safety regulations and talk about what life was like in the pit .
there was a good response to their appeal and now two have been recruited .
museum head of historic operations jane gibson said : " we knew last year that one of our long-serving deputies would be retiring and we started the recruitment back in the spring last year .
" and we found through the normal channels we were n't getting people .
so we decided to go to the press . "
" basically i think it is the job of a lifetime .
i have always been in the mining environment since i was a young boy " thomas muncaster she said following the publicity , they had had inquiries from as far afield as australia .
the new pit deputies are thomas muncaster and stuart davison .
