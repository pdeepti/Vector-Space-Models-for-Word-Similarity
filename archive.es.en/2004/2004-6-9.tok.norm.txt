three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .

but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .

sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms a federal judge in the united states dismissed a lawsuit on tuesday that claimed 17 german companies - including bmw , volkswagen and deutsche bank - withheld $ 100 million -lrb- € 82.2 million -rrb- from a fund for victims of nazi-era forced labor .
judge william g. bassler ruled that the case should not be decided by the courts but that diplomats should handle the matter .
he noted that german and u.s. officials have already agreed to resolve the issue .
the german companies argued they had fulfilled their financial obligations to the $ 5 billion reparations fund , which is administered by a foundation called " remembrance , responsibility and the future . "
the fund has made $ 3 billion in payments to 1.5 million people around the world .
those bringing the case against them claimed the companies owe an additional $ 100 million in interest accrued during the delay .
legal teams on both sides of the case agreed last month that when the fund was established in december 1999 , german companies promised to pay their $ 2.5 billion share , plus interest totaling " at least " the equivalent of $ 50 million . more briefs 09.06.2004 -pipe- german exports and imports increase in april 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling 08.06.2004 -pipe- bundesbank : lack of cents creating trouble for euro 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany mulls tax on jet fuel 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft and sap reveal failed merger talks 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany 's jobless rate falls in may 07.06.2004 -pipe- still no decision on filters for diesel cars 07.06.2004 -pipe- schröder reportedly worried by " nationalist " french industrial policy 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .
but not knowing quite where to put the ex-reichstag flag , the site 's managers opted to place it under " miscellaneous , " provoking consternation that such an important national symbol should have been auctioned off alongside items including stuffed trophy fish , juice glasses , and decorative plaster angel heads . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links www.zoll.de web site of the german customs administration -lrb- also in english -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .
but not knowing quite where to put the ex-reichstag flag , the site 's managers opted to place it under " miscellaneous , " provoking consternation that such an important national symbol should have been auctioned off alongside items including stuffed trophy fish , juice glasses , and decorative plaster angel heads . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links www.zoll.de web site of the german customs administration -lrb- also in english -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .
but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .

diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .

troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .
but not knowing quite where to put the ex-reichstag flag , the site 's managers opted to place it under " miscellaneous , " provoking consternation that such an important national symbol should have been auctioned off alongside items including stuffed trophy fish , juice glasses , and decorative plaster angel heads . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links www.zoll.de web site of the german customs administration -lrb- also in english -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.06.2004 german teens sentenced for abusing classmate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the accused upon his arrival at court on monday .
three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .
but not knowing quite where to put the ex-reichstag flag , the site 's managers opted to place it under " miscellaneous , " provoking consternation that such an important national symbol should have been auctioned off alongside items including stuffed trophy fish , juice glasses , and decorative plaster angel heads . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links www.zoll.de web site of the german customs administration -lrb- also in english -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.06.2004 u.n. security council passes iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council voted 15-0 for the resolution the u.n. security council unanimously backed a u.s.-british resolution on iraq 's future tuesday in a major step to healing the deep international divisions over the war that brought down saddam hussein . world leaders have praised the new u.n. security council resolution on iraq , which endorses the new interim government , and sets out a timetable for democratic elections to be held no later than january 31 , 2005 .
british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .
" since they injured someone else , they should learn what kind of consequences injuries can have , " court spokesman jan-michael seidel told reporters . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .

doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "
but the quarrel between both governments is now a thing of the past , he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads to u.s. as trade war looms german chancellor gerhard schröder embarked on a two-day trip to new york on thursday to strengthen u.s.-german business ties .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .

what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .

and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .
while a shoe store in a train station may sell footwear on sundays , other such shops outside the station are prohibited from doing so . the numerous exceptions have left the law riddled with loopholes , prompting economy minister wolfgang clement to say it should be scrapped . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .
but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .

diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .

troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of daniel libeskind 's design .
the rescue of nearly all danish jews during the holocaust is only one part of the museum ’ s permanent exhibition .
visitors also learn a lot about the history of jews in denmark , about jewish religious and cultural traditions and daily life . igal avidan -lrb- my -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin architect to build twin towers replacement it 's official : berlin-based architect daniel libeskind has won an international competition to fill the vacuum where the world trade center towers once stood .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.06.2004 u.n. security council passes iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council voted 15-0 for the resolution the u.n. security council unanimously backed a u.s.-british resolution on iraq 's future tuesday in a major step to healing the deep international divisions over the war that brought down saddam hussein . world leaders have praised the new u.n. security council resolution on iraq , which endorses the new interim government , and sets out a timetable for democratic elections to be held no later than january 31 , 2005 .
british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .

while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .
but not knowing quite where to put the ex-reichstag flag , the site 's managers opted to place it under " miscellaneous , " provoking consternation that such an important national symbol should have been auctioned off alongside items including stuffed trophy fish , juice glasses , and decorative plaster angel heads . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links www.zoll.de web site of the german customs administration -lrb- also in english -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.06.2004 copenhagen museum recalls dramatic rescue of jews großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : copenhagen 's new architectural jewel tuesday 's opening of a daniel libeskind-designed jewish museum in denmark casts light on one of the few happy chapters in wwii history : the rescue of 7,000 danish jews from nazi persecution . unlike the jewish museum in berlin , which from a distance resembles a silver spacecraft , copenhagen 's new danish jewish museum is not so easy to find .
only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of daniel libeskind 's design .
the rescue of nearly all danish jews during the holocaust is only one part of the museum ’ s permanent exhibition .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .
while a shoe store in a train station may sell footwear on sundays , other such shops outside the station are prohibited from doing so . the numerous exceptions have left the law riddled with loopholes , prompting economy minister wolfgang clement to say it should be scrapped . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .

judge william g. bassler ruled that the case should not be decided by the courts but that diplomats should handle the matter .
he noted that german and u.s. officials have already agreed to resolve the issue .
the german companies argued they had fulfilled their financial obligations to the $ 5 billion reparations fund , which is administered by a foundation called " remembrance , responsibility and the future . "
the fund has made $ 3 billion in payments to 1.5 million people around the world .
those bringing the case against them claimed the companies owe an additional $ 100 million in interest accrued during the delay .
legal teams on both sides of the case agreed last month that when the fund was established in december 1999 , german companies promised to pay their $ 2.5 billion share , plus interest totaling " at least " the equivalent of $ 50 million . more briefs 09.06.2004 -pipe- german exports and imports increase in april 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling 08.06.2004 -pipe- bundesbank : lack of cents creating trouble for euro 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany mulls tax on jet fuel 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft and sap reveal failed merger talks 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany 's jobless rate falls in may 07.06.2004 -pipe- still no decision on filters for diesel cars 07.06.2004 -pipe- schröder reportedly worried by " nationalist " french industrial policy 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .
while a shoe store in a train station may sell footwear on sundays , other such shops outside the station are prohibited from doing so . the numerous exceptions have left the law riddled with loopholes , prompting economy minister wolfgang clement to say it should be scrapped . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .
but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .

but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .
" since they injured someone else , they should learn what kind of consequences injuries can have , " court spokesman jan-michael seidel told reporters . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

judge william g. bassler ruled that the case should not be decided by the courts but that diplomats should handle the matter .
he noted that german and u.s. officials have already agreed to resolve the issue .
the german companies argued they had fulfilled their financial obligations to the $ 5 billion reparations fund , which is administered by a foundation called " remembrance , responsibility and the future . "
the fund has made $ 3 billion in payments to 1.5 million people around the world .
those bringing the case against them claimed the companies owe an additional $ 100 million in interest accrued during the delay .
legal teams on both sides of the case agreed last month that when the fund was established in december 1999 , german companies promised to pay their $ 2.5 billion share , plus interest totaling " at least " the equivalent of $ 50 million . more briefs 09.06.2004 -pipe- german exports and imports increase in april 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft appeals eu anti-trust ruling 08.06.2004 -pipe- bundesbank : lack of cents creating trouble for euro 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany mulls tax on jet fuel 08.06.2004 -pipe- microsoft and sap reveal failed merger talks 08.06.2004 -pipe- germany 's jobless rate falls in may 07.06.2004 -pipe- still no decision on filters for diesel cars 07.06.2004 -pipe- schröder reportedly worried by " nationalist " french industrial policy 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .

troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .

but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .
while a shoe store in a train station may sell footwear on sundays , other such shops outside the station are prohibited from doing so . the numerous exceptions have left the law riddled with loopholes , prompting economy minister wolfgang clement to say it should be scrapped . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales .
-lrb- july 21 , 2003 -rrb- germany extends shopping hours starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away .

" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .

at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .

according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of daniel libeskind 's design .
the rescue of nearly all danish jews during the holocaust is only one part of the museum ’ s permanent exhibition .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .
but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .
continued unrest in congo could spark a wider regional conflict , something both the un and eu officials are hoping to avoid . dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops to help restore peace in congo the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .
but not knowing quite where to put the ex-reichstag flag , the site 's managers opted to place it under " miscellaneous , " provoking consternation that such an important national symbol should have been auctioned off alongside items including stuffed trophy fish , juice glasses , and decorative plaster angel heads . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links www.zoll.de web site of the german customs administration -lrb- also in english -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model of daniel libeskind 's design .
the rescue of nearly all danish jews during the holocaust is only one part of the museum ’ s permanent exhibition .

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .
but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.06.2004 u.n. security council passes iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council voted 15-0 for the resolution the u.n. security council unanimously backed a u.s.-british resolution on iraq 's future tuesday in a major step to healing the deep international divisions over the war that brought down saddam hussein . world leaders have praised the new u.n. security council resolution on iraq , which endorses the new interim government , and sets out a timetable for democratic elections to be held no later than january 31 , 2005 .
british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2004 high court rejects liberalizing store hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers have until 8 p.m. - except on sundays germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution . the constitutional court in karlsruhe upheld the ban on stores opening after 8 p.m. and on sundays and holidays .
the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .

he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .
" since they injured someone else , they should learn what kind of consequences injuries can have , " court spokesman jan-michael seidel told reporters . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the view from the summit g-8 leaders head to u.s. summit a platform for protest what is the g-8 ?
from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .

from bit player to global heavyweight current affairs -pipe- 09.06.2004 germany-u.s. exhibit chummy ties at g-8 summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder , president bush and first dog barney relaxing after almost 18 months of fluctuating tensions between berlin and washington , german chancellor schröder and u.s. president bush held a cordial meeting on the fringes of the g8 summit proving they were chummy once again . if george w. bush and gerhard schröder had known that the key to resuming friendly ties between the united states and germany would have been as simple as sharing a joke over a dog , the transatlantic chill may have have subsided a lot sooner .
but credit where credit is due : barney the terrier 's ice breaking skills on the fringes of the g-8 summit on sea island off the coast of georgia came better late than never . meeting for their third bilateral talks since the end of the iraq war , bush and schröder seemed at ease in front of the camera as the first dog of the united states bridged the gap between the two leaders and offered light relief from the tensions of the past . barney can not take all the credit , however .
germany and the united states have been edging towards normal relations for some months now and , according to u.s. officials , this latest meeting was the " friendliest conversation since before the iraq war . "
it could not have harmed matters that president bush was basking in the afterglow of a unanimous agreement on a new iraq resolution in the united nations . and schröder was not going to be upstaged by barney behind the scenes .
the german chancellor has been working solidly to meet the president in the middle ground on issues where the two leaders have spent much of the past 18 months at opposite poles . no soldiers but reconstruction from germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder have attempted to meet halfway on issues that have divided them for so long .
while accepting that washington 's current policy is to win the peace militarily , schröder reiterated the german position that a common solution must be found which suits all those involved .
and while bush has conceded that germany will send no soldiers to iraq , schröder has honored his understanding by pledging german support to the reconstruction process .
" we are ready to take part in the reconstruction ... and we are already making progress in this , " the chancellor told the gathered reporters . president bush opened the meeting by thanking schröder for germany 's efforts in promoting peace , his work " for freedom all around the world " and emphasized above all the german military contribution in afghanistan and in the balkans .
" i am glad to continue our dialogue in the spirit of collaboration and friendship , " said bush .
the president then singled out special thanks to german foreign secretary joschka fischer for his contribution in the middle east , according to schröder . iraq resolution welcomed by both leaders bush also praised the collaboration on the new iraq resolution which was passed by the u.n. security council on tuesday .
schröder called the resolution an important contribution to stability in iraq and in the whole middle east and said that a new chance presents itself to the iraqi people . " democracy can not be imposed on the states of the middle east , " schröder said .
however , both the u.s. and germany agreed on the fact that the countries of the region should not be treated like children " and force on them our own values , " said the chancellor .
changes in these societies would have to come from within , and with the support of the g-8 countries . schröder calls for more transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instability in oil-producing nations is connected to economic development , according to schröder .
the chancellor also referred to the connection between economic development and political stability .
the increasing oil prices were a result of speculation as well as from " perceived and real instability , " he observed .
the current oil situation has not yet become a menace to the economic situation in germany but will be an important topic at the summit , with schröder calling for more transparency in the oil market . the official u.s. statement after the half hour-long meeting said of german-u.s. relations that " there have unquestionably been differences , however , strong progress is being made in almost all questions regarding the near and the middle east . "
the statement continued that the u.s. and germany have reached an understanding " to work on common subjects again . " according to an unnamed bush aide , as quoted in the german spiegel magazine , the president understands the german position " very well . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2004 high court rejects liberalizing store hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shoppers have until 8 p.m. - except on sundays germany 's highest court decided on wednesday that the country 's strict shopping hours are in line with the constitution . the constitutional court in karlsruhe upheld the ban on stores opening after 8 p.m. and on sundays and holidays .
the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .
while a shoe store in a train station may sell footwear on sundays , other such shops outside the station are prohibited from doing so . the numerous exceptions have left the law riddled with loopholes , prompting economy minister wolfgang clement to say it should be scrapped . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales .
-lrb- july 21 , 2003 -rrb- germany extends shopping hours starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .

" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .

according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "

only after you ’ ve entered the lovely and almost hidden garden of the royal library do you discover the first traces of new architecture along the classical 1906 brick building .
two white marks on the pebbled path lead you to a gray marble piazza .
there you find a massive door bearing a sign with the hebrew word mitzvah , or " a good dead . "
" it is referring to the danish rescue of the jews in 1943 , mitzvah , a good deed , " says museum director janne lauresen .
" this jewish museum tells a unique story no other jewish museum can . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : postcards from theresienstadt : 500 danish jews were sent to concentration camps , but most survived .
the museum , which opened in copenhagen on tuesday , features exhibits on the history , culture , and art of danish jews since the 17th century .
the building ’ s unusual design and the concept for the exhibitions are the work of celebrity architect daniel libeskind , who also designed the jewish museum in berlin .
but what sets the museum apart from its predecessors is denmark 's unique world war ii history .
sailing to sweden in october 1943 , when news of the imminent deportation of jews to nazi death camps reached denmark , 7,000 jews were hidden overnight , and within several weeks they were brought in fishing boats to neutral sweden .
some jews failed to escape and were deported to the theresienstadt concentration camp , but most survived the war and were welcomed back to denmark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libeskind 's architecture can be disorienting , in this case evoking the difficult journey of denmark 's jews to sweden .
liebeskind wanted to convey a sense of what the danish jews went through as they fled from the nazis .
at the same time , he also wanted to convey the moral courage of many danes , which was unique in europe during world war ii .
" the floor gives you the atmosphere of being at sea because it is n't level , " she says .
" you lose the sense of having solid ground beneath your feet , which is exactly the same feeling the jews had going in ships to sweden . "
history in a shoebox for a modern-day jewish museum , the exhibition space is remarkably small , especially for displaying 300 years of history .
with its mere 300 square meters , the nearly hidden building was too small , in fact , to accommodate the guests invited by the danish queen margrethe ii for the opening festivities .
according to kent matinussen , director of the danish architecture museum , this is the site where copenhagen became the seat of danish power 800 years ago .
" it 's the court of the royal library , and it 's actually on the very foundations of the capital of denmark , " he says .
" it 's a very small island in the center of the city . "
the royal boathouse , which is where the museum proper is located , was also used as a marine armory by king christian iv , the same monarch who invited the first jews to denmark in 1619 .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .
while a shoe store in a train station may sell footwear on sundays , other such shops outside the station are prohibited from doing so . the numerous exceptions have left the law riddled with loopholes , prompting economy minister wolfgang clement to say it should be scrapped . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .
for one , stores are allowed to be open three hours on sundays and holidays .
more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .
while a shoe store in a train station may sell footwear on sundays , other such shops outside the station are prohibited from doing so . the numerous exceptions have left the law riddled with loopholes , prompting economy minister wolfgang clement to say it should be scrapped . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de retailers : longer shop hours might not help economy the german retailers association hde , which represents 100,000 retailers , has said plans by economics minster wolfgang clement to allow stores to stay open 24 hours from monday to saturday may fail to boost consumer spending and employment .
-lrb- april 26 , 2004 -rrb- longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.
saturdays has brought with it more than hassle-free shopping .
it 's also boosted sales .
-lrb- july 21 , 2003 -rrb- germany extends shopping hours starting saturday , german stores may stay open until 8 p.m. despite protests from organized labor .
but sunday shopping is likely still years away .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .
some of the youths will be required to take first-aid courses .
" since they injured someone else , they should learn what kind of consequences injuries can have , " court spokesman jan-michael seidel told reporters . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german schools struggle with bullying several recent cases of extreme violence at german schools have provoked officials to call for video surveillance .

three german students at a vocational school in northern germany have been sentenced to jail time for mistreating a classmate .
six others involved in the abuse that went on for months received lesser sentences . the court in the town of hildesheim , near hanover , convicted three of the students who abused a classmate of grievous bodily harm and coercion , giving them sentences of between 15 and 18 months in prison .
six accomplices received probation , community service or two weeks in juvenile detention .
a total of eleven students from the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim went on trial on may 25th , but judges had earlier dropped the case against two of those charged for lack of evidence .
senseless crime in a case that shocked germany by its seeming senselessness , the students , aged between 16 and 18 , beat and kicked their victim , who was 17 years old at the time , only weeks after he had begun a one-year vocational training program at the school . the abuse took place over a period between november 2003 and january 2004 and included forcing the victim to strip , eat chalk , chew cigarette butts and kiss his abusers ' feet .
he suffered cuts and bruises .
none of the accused was able to explain why they acted as they did .
the abusers videotaped their actions , which took place in a classroom and a storeroom at the school , eventually posting pictures of the mistreatment on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the werner von siemens vocational school in hildesheim prosecutors say the abuse was an open secret at the school , but went on for months before the victim told a school counselor about it .
he claimed one teacher at the school knew what was happening but did nothing about it .
while prosecutors had called for sentences of three months for the ringleaders , a court spokesman said the fact that the culprits had confessed to defense lawyers and made sometimes " very personal " apologies had mitigated the sentences and helped the victim , known by his first name dieter , now 17 years old .
" it 's done him a lot of good that all of the accused have apologized to him , " his lawyer , gabriele pochert , told reporters .
two of the teenagers were convicted to 18 months in jail , another to 15 months .
three received probation , two must serve two weeks in a youth detention center and one was sentenced to 80 hours community service .

one german flag .
what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .
as one berlin newspaper put it , it 's a start .
odd company there was , however , some criticism about how the auction was listed on the customs administration 's web site .
its online auction house is typically used to dispose of seized or rejected goods , which are grouped into categories such as toys , clothing and electronics .
but not knowing quite where to put the ex-reichstag flag , the site 's managers opted to place it under " miscellaneous , " provoking consternation that such an important national symbol should have been auctioned off alongside items including stuffed trophy fish , juice glasses , and decorative plaster angel heads . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links www.zoll.de web site of the german customs administration -lrb- also in english -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

what to do when empty coffers need topping up ?
the answer for the bundestag , it seems , is blowing in the wind .
parliament pocketed over € 3,000 by auctioning a german flag that once flew atop the reichstag . the first ever auction of a german flag from the top of the reichstag building in berlin drew a total of 123 bids , and brought more than 29,000 hits to the web site of the german customs administration , which organized the auction on behalf of the bundestag .
in the end , a persistent bidder registered as " x-carree " prevailed , snapping up the coveted item for a mere € 3,350 -lrb- $ 4,072 -rrb- .
authenticity guaranteed the giant flag , which measures 6.4 x 4.5 meters -lrb- approximately 7 x 5 yards -rrb- comes with a certificate of authenticity .
the item description notes that the flag shows the usual signs of wear and tear , such as frayed edges and the odd stain - remnants of the four weeks it spent flapping in berlin 's famously strong winds .
the bundestag receives all profits from the sale .
and while the money is a mere drop in the ocean compared with germany 's budget shortfall this year of almost € 10 billion , it demonstrates a refreshingly innovative attitude towards fundraising .

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .
but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .

the court said the law was neither discriminatory nor violated freedom to practice one 's profession . the decision was triggered by a legal challenge from the nationwide department store chain kaufhof warenhaus , a subsidiary of the metro group , which was appealing a lawsuit brought against it for selling items it labled as souvenirs to be able to open on a sunday .
kaufhof argued that the law was unfair since some shops are exempt from the ban .
the eight-member court was evenly split , but without a unanimous decision the legislation can not be changed . liberalizing german shopping hours has been debated for decades .
the 1956 legislation that strictly limited when shops could be open was first altered in 1996 , allowing stores to sell their wares until 8 p.m. on weekdays -lrb- previously 6:30 p.m. -rrb- and until 4 p.m. and saturdays -lrb- previously 2 p.m. -rrb- .
last year , saturday opening hours were extended to 8 p.m.
sunday shopping is banned , at least in theory . while the business community is largely in favor of extending store hours , trade unions have been decisively opposed , saying employees must then work longer hours .
along with the churches , they also reject sunday opening hours , arguing that no one should have to work on that day . riddled with loopholes but loopholes have for years undermined the restrictions , particularly on sundays .

more importantly , different rules apply to gas stations , which are allowed to sell articles for travelers , including books , flowers and food " in small quantities . " thus , many gas stations have practically turned into 24-hour supermarkets .
in addition , newsstands and stores in train stations , airports and other places where tourist go also benefit from exemptions to the law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.06.2004 -pipe- 14:00 utc judge dismisses nazi compensation suit against german firms a federal judge in the united states dismissed a lawsuit on tuesday that claimed 17 german companies - including bmw , volkswagen and deutsche bank - withheld $ 100 million -lrb- € 82.2 million -rrb- from a fund for victims of nazi-era forced labor .
judge william g. bassler ruled that the case should not be decided by the courts but that diplomats should handle the matter .
he noted that german and u.s. officials have already agreed to resolve the issue .
the german companies argued they had fulfilled their financial obligations to the $ 5 billion reparations fund , which is administered by a foundation called " remembrance , responsibility and the future . "

after new fighting broke out last week in congo , the belgian foreign minister says the eu may deploy a peacekeeping force .
diplomats in brussels , however , tell a very different story . after wrapping up a trip to kinshasa , the capital of the troubled democratic republic of congo , belgian foreign minister louis michel said the eu was considering sending a peacekeeping force to the region - akin to the french-led force sent earlier this year - to help contain the latest outbreak of fighting in the eastern city of bukavu .
he claimed the eu foreign ministers would discuss the matter at an upcoming meeting in luxembourg on monday . however , shortly after the belgian minister made these comments , diplomats in brussels appeared to be scratching their heads and said that the eu was considering nothing of the sort .
in an interview with the reuters news agency , one brussels diplomat accused michal of " freelancing " . at best , according to the same reuters report , the eu may send 12 small teams of ceasefire monitors if a truce is agreed .
but , altogether , that would amount to fewer than 100 people , significantly less than the more than the more than 1,100 troop strong french-led force - including several hundred german soldiers functioning in supporting roles - sent earlier this year . trying to hammer out a truce as it remained unclear whether or not the eu would send in a sizeable force , the united nations continued to struggle to establish a truce after they lost control of the eastern city of bukavu to rival factions over the weekend . two south african peacekeepers were killed in the violence over the weekend , which continued early in the week .
troops loyal to two tutsi military leaders came into conflict with the region 's army commander , brig. gen. mbuza mabe , and took control of the city .
meanwhile , thousands took to the streets to protest the inability of the un to maintain order . following the return of relative calm on tuesday , un leaders began negotiations with the rebel leaders , which resulted in one , brig. gen. laurent nkunda , agreeing to drop his demand that the government replace mabe as leader of the regional army . other african heads of state have called upon the un to boost it 's 10,800 troop strong force in the country .
in a statement released after a meeting of the comesa trade bloc of african countries in the ugandan capital of kampala , the leaders " urged the united nations security council to deploy more peacekeepers to the area . " an ongoing conflict the latest outbreak of violence has threatened the delicate peace and the authority of the transitional government , led by president joseph kabila , which took control of the country last june after five years of civil war . the war is estimated to have claimed more than 3.3 million lives , with many dying as a result of disease and famine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.06.2004 u.n. security council passes iraq resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council voted 15-0 for the resolution the u.n. security council unanimously backed a u.s.-british resolution on iraq 's future tuesday in a major step to healing the deep international divisions over the war that brought down saddam hussein . world leaders have praised the new u.n. security council resolution on iraq , which endorses the new interim government , and sets out a timetable for democratic elections to be held no later than january 31 , 2005 .
british and american leaders took the unanimous vote as a sign that that the international community stands behind their plans for iraq 's future .
british prime minister tony blair called the vote a " milestone " .
" we all now want to put the divisions of the past behind us and unite behind the vision of a modern , democratic and stable iraq that can be a force for good , not just for iraqis but for the whole region and thus the whole world , " blair said .
" this is a very important moment , " u.s. president george w. bush said before the vote .
" a free iraq will serve as a catalyst for change in the broader middle east , which is an important part of winning the war on terror . "
main points the resolution gives international legitimacy to the new caretaker government in baghdad , which takes over from u.s. forces on june 30 .
it places iraqi security forces under iraqi control , and also gives iraq the authority to request the departure of the roughly 150,000 u.s.-led troops .
while troops remain in the country , they have leeway to take " all necessary measures " in fighting insurgents .
the resolution gives the new government control over oil and gas revenues , and adds an iraqi member to the international advisory board charged with ensuring fiscal transparency .
it also provides for the establishment of a dedicated force to provide security for u.n. staff in iraq , a key concern for the world body after a bombing at the u.n. 's baghdad offices in august killed 22 people .
compromise necessary the u.s. and britain had to compromise on the issue of u.s.-led forces before they could clinch the diplomatic victory .
france and germany , two of the council 's most vocal critics of the war in iraq , wanted the interim government to have veto power over major military operations .
iraq 's new leaders did n't demand such power , so paris and berlin agreed to the u.s. compromise to coordinate " sensitive " offensive operations with a national security committee . france has called the resolution " an important text for pursuing the political process in iraq . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder was also pleased with the outcome , and said it would bring " more stability " to iraq . germany had been calling for a complete , swift transfer of sovereignty to iraq 's transitional government , and that 's what this resolution promises , schröder said .
he reaffirmed his earlier decision not to send any german troops to iraq , but said germany would continue to help with the reconstruction effort .
doubts about stability persist although largely hailed as a victory for iraq and international diplomacy , concerns remain about whether the resolution will create stability on the ground .
russia 's deputy u.n. ambassador alexander konuzin noted that the situation in iraq " remains a bleeding wound in the middle east and in world politics . "
he said only time would tell whether the resolution would help achieve a turnaround .
european commission president roman prodi struck a similarly cautious note , saying the impact of the resolution " has to be judged on its capacity to create a new situation with respect to the chaos , not necessarily tomorrow morning , but reasonably soon . "
in germany , criticism came from green party parliamentarian hans christian ströbele , who said the new resolution is n't sufficient , as it does n't specify a date when u.s.-led troops should leave the country .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung , ströbele said that u.s. soldiers should prepare to leave within months .
" i do n't think that it will be possible to stabilize iraq until there 's a definite date for the troops to pull out , " ströbele said . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de way looks clear for new u.n. iraq resolution france and germany appear ready to approve a u.n. resolution on the transfer of power in iraq on tuesday , following last-minute changes to the draft by the u.s. and great britain .

it will be a unique resource in the uk palliative care consultant professor ilora finlay patients in wales with possible or confirmed cancer will be asked to take part in the project , which begins on wednesday .
although it may take years to determine the causes and best treatments for cancer , those involved with the project say it is a major investment for future generations .
professor malcolm mason , director of the wales cancer bank said : " as a doctor treating cancer patients , i am only too aware of the limitations of our current treatments .
" we desperately need a new assault on this disease and i believe that the wales cancer bank will provide just that . "
launching the new facility , health minister jane hutt described it as " a pioneering development " .
" the knowledge gleaned from research carried out by specialists working with the cancer bank will make a major contribution to the health of people in wales , and indeed the wider world , " she said .
" the aim is to achieve a greater understanding of cancer and to be able to provide better treatments for patients with cancer .
" this initiative clearly demonstrates our commitment to developing a scientific evidence base to form the basis of our fight against cancer .
palliative care expert professor ilora finlay added : " ' the challenge is that cancer is so complicated and studies need to be done on hundreds , or even thousands , of samples to give meaningful results .
" that is why it is important that the wales cancer bank is a huge scale project .
indeed , it will be a unique resource in the uk and will work closely with similar initiatives in europe . "

the chartered institute of housing -lrb- cih -rrb- in scotland said an extra £ 331m a year was needed to meet the demand for inexpensive housing to rent .
it said 8,200 homes each year were needed to satisfy the soaring need for affordable homes in scotland .
it claims as many as 43 % of first-time buyers can not afford to buy on the open market in the current property boom .
' tiny drop ' director of cih in scotland alan ferguson said : " the executive needs to fund the building of nearly twice as many affordable homes to rent as it is currently committed to .
" we reckon this will cost an extra £ 331m a year , equivalent to about £ 40,000 per new home and £ 331m is a tiny drop for the executive budget of nearly £ 26bn . "
communities minister margaret curran said the results of the executive 's review of the affordable housing situation would be announced in the next few weeks .
she said : " the review is focusing on the housing needs of first-time buyers and key workers seeking home ownership as well as rented accommodation .
" we are also looking at a full range of policy responses that include finding ways of getting better value for money from public resources , low-cost home ownership options , possible changes to planning requirements and measures to address any constraints with regard to new housing developments .

vicky horgan , 27 , and her sister , emma walton , 25 , were killed in sunday 's attack in oxfordshire 's highmoor cross .
husband stuart horgan , 39 , has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder .
police authority members say they share public concerns at the hour delay before medics could treat the victims .
they say they will raise these with the thames valley police force 's chief constable at wednesday 's meeting of the authority .
police authority member tony page said : " i share the concerns that have been expressed by a number of people about the seeming delay in the police being able to declare the scene safe and therefore allow access for themselves and other emergency services . "
he said it was a coincidence that there happened to be a meeting of the authority in kidlington on wednesday but he would use it to raise concerns with the chief constable .
" clearly there are matters of concern to members of the authority that are shared by the wider public that need to be addressed as soon as possible , " he said .
henley mp boris johnson has also said police should review the way they dealt with such incidents .
critically ill in the aftermath of the incident , thames valley police defended themselves saying they had to wait to assess the level of danger .
south oxfordshire area commander superintendent jill simpson said : " firearms operations demand a calculated response in order to safeguard any members of the public who could be at risk as well as the officers and other emergency service personnel who could be at the scene . "
mr horgan , from plaistow , london , is to appear before oxford magistrates on wednesday .
mrs horgan 's mother , jacqueline , is critically ill in hospital .

however a glimmer of hope has appeared in the form of a family business in the shetland isles , johnson sea farms .
they may have come up with a solution to keep cod firmly on the menu by starting the uk 's first commercial cod farm .
brothers , angus and ivor johnson , the owners of johnson sea farms , started out as fishermen before moving into salmon farming in the early 80s .
their business flourished but in 1994 they sold out , just in time .
by the mid-nineties the gold rush that had been the salmon farming industry was over .
from codling to profit they looked for new business opportunities .
farming cod was a possibility , but initially was deemed too complicated because young cod have a tendency to cannibalism .
karol rzepkowski hopes he can sell cod to city investors however , the increasing rarity of wild cod in conjunction with the continued high demand for the fish has pushed up the price of cod .
now , it just might be financially viable to farm this highly priced fish .
so , the johnsons have started a new company johnson 's cod , and brought in marketing whiz kid karol rzepkowski as a director .
in order to get the new cod venture off the ground karol has come up with an ingenious scheme .
the plan is to raise £ 2.5m in the city which will allow johnson cod to buy 1.5m codling and raise them to maturity .
the full grown cod would then be sold and investors left with healthy profits .
the question is will city investors take the bait ?
the bad aftertaste of salmon farming overshadowing all this is the experience of what happened to farmed salmon , an industry burdened by a seemingly endless stream of bad publicity .
salmon farming 's environmental record is under scrutiny environmentalists have complained about the chemicals used to treat fish diseases , the pollution from salmon farms that goes directly into the sea , and the detrimental effect of fish farms on wild salmon populations .
investors face the threat that environmentalists , who see salmon farming as a catastrophe , will extend their fight against the farming of cod .
a flood of cod ?
the early signs do n't look good .
don staniford from the salmon farm protest group sees cod farming as a ' disaster waiting to happen ' .
with the latest farmed salmon scare in january raising questions and controversy over how safe farmed salmon is to eat , city investors will have to believe in karol 's ability to distance his cod farming project from this bad publicity .
even if the johnsons do manage to convince investors to back their project , they will have other hurdles to jump .
one of the most daunting problems salmon farmers have had to face is overproduction and the corresponding drop in prices .
chances are the same thing will happen all over again .
nutreco , the world 's biggest farmed salmon producer , will soon be producing three times more farmed cod than the johnsons , at its sites in norway .
magnus skretting , who is in charge of nutreco 's cod project , believes that " the norwegian industry can produce easily 100,000 tonnes within 2010 and then double it within 2013 " .
organic cod the norwegians are deadly serious about making cod work .
their government has already invested £ 20m into researching and developing this new farmed product .
cod and chips is getting pricey as wild fish stocks dwindle if norway can pull this off then it could be hard for the johnsons to get the price they need for their cod .
so , the johnsons ' cod farming project looks risky but they have a plan ; they believe that by making their farm organic they will produce a premium product that will not directly compete with any other cod .
the hope is that organic status will also help them to avoid the negative image of farmed fish and allow consumer confidence to be restored .
the plan sounds reasonable enough but they are still waiting to see if they will get organic status .

so , the johnsons have started a new company johnson 's cod , and brought in marketing whiz kid karol rzepkowski as a director .
in order to get the new cod venture off the ground karol has come up with an ingenious scheme .
the plan is to raise £ 2.5m in the city which will allow johnson cod to buy 1.5m codling and raise them to maturity .
the full grown cod would then be sold and investors left with healthy profits .
the question is will city investors take the bait ?
the bad aftertaste of salmon farming overshadowing all this is the experience of what happened to farmed salmon , an industry burdened by a seemingly endless stream of bad publicity .
environmentalists have complained about the chemicals used to treat fish diseases , the pollution from salmon farms that goes directly into the sea , and the detrimental effect of fish farms on wild salmon populations .
investors face the threat that environmentalists , who see salmon farming as a catastrophe , will extend their fight against the farming of cod .
a flood of cod ?
the early signs do n't look good .
don staniford from the salmon farm protest group sees cod farming as a ' disaster waiting to happen ' .
with the latest farmed salmon scare in january raising questions and controversy over how safe farmed salmon is to eat , city investors will have to believe in karol 's ability to distance his cod farming project from this bad publicity .
even if the johnsons do manage to convince investors to back their project , they will have other hurdles to jump .
one of the most daunting problems salmon farmers have had to face is overproduction and the corresponding drop in prices .
chances are the same thing will happen all over again .
nutreco , the world 's biggest farmed salmon producer , will soon be producing three times more farmed cod than the johnsons , at its sites in norway .
magnus skretting , who is in charge of nutreco 's cod project , believes that " the norwegian industry can produce easily 100,000 tonnes within 2010 and then double it within 2013 " .
organic cod the norwegians are deadly serious about making cod work .
their government has already invested £ 20m into researching and developing this new farmed product .
if norway can pull this off then it could be hard for the johnsons to get the price they need for their cod .
so , the johnsons ' cod farming project looks risky but they have a plan ; they believe that by making their farm organic they will produce a premium product that will not directly compete with any other cod .
the hope is that organic status will also help them to avoid the negative image of farmed fish and allow consumer confidence to be restored .
the plan sounds reasonable enough but they are still waiting to see if they will get organic status .
if cod farming works , it could secure the future of our favourite fish whilst also giving a much needed boost to the uk 's troubled fish farmers .
over the next year or so , we 'll find out if they 've got it right .

research on women with early stage breast cancer found taking letrozole after a course of another drug , tamoxifen , cut death rates by 39 % until now there have been no treatment options for women who finish their course of tamoxifen after five years .
the international study , of 5,200 women , included five hospitals in the uk . "
this is an exciting development in improving overall survival of postmenopausal women with breast cancer . "
professor ian smith the women finished their course of tamoxifen , and then took letrozole for an average of two-and-a-half years .
it is recommended that tamoxifen should not be taken for more than five years because its benefits begin to wane , and there is a risk of endometrial cancer , pulmonary embolism and stroke .
however , the risk of a recurrence of breast cancer remains .
spread the latest study , co-ordinated by the national cancer institute of canada clinical trials group , also found that letrozole cut the risk of the cancer spreading to another part of the body by 40 % .
letrozole - known commercially as femara - is an aromatase inhibitor .
it works by blocking production of the sex hormone oestrogen , which is linked to the development of many breast tumours .
professor ian smith , one of the investigators and head of the breast unit at the royal marsden nhs trust , said : " this is an exciting development in improving overall survival of postmenopausal women with breast cancer .
" femara is the first hormonal therapy to offer a post-tamoxifen option to reduce the risk of recurrence .
" we now know it may also offer women with node-positive early breast cancer an improvement in overall survival , nearly halving their residual risk of dying from this disease . "
worry samia al qadhi , joint chief executive of charity breast cancer care , said : " from our daily contact with women who have breast cancer , we know that they worry about recurrence of their breast cancer .
" the findings of this trial continue to give hope to the tens of thousands of women in the uk who are living with breast cancer , and potentially offer women an option of extended hormone treatment that may maximise their chances of survival . "
earlier this year another study , co-ordinated by cancer research uk , found that patients who switched from tamoxifen to the aromatase inhibitor exemestane halfway through treatment reduced the risk of the disease returning by a third .
the national institute of clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- is currently considering whether to make aromatase inhibitors widely available on the nhs for the treatment of early disease .
the results of the study were presented at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting in new orleans .
