imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .
she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .
" it would have been more clever to come to an agreement earlier , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
kahn said hitzfeld has reacted to the speculation with " unbelievable character and a lot of style . "
french middlefield player willy sagnol called hitzfeld 's treatment " bullshit " and said he would try and transfer to another club immediately .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .
she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .
i understand power as a grouping of different interests , " schwan has said . she 's also taken a jibe at rival köhler 's status by hinting that he was only an expert when it came to economics , given his imf background .

he added that only two issues were outstanding , the level of bankruptcy and pricing .
yanukovych described the problem as " outdated " , and said that the issue must be solved at the summit .
the move would clear a major hurdle on ukraine 's path towards becoming a member of the world trade organisation .
yanukovych is tipped as a candidate to become the next ukrainian president and has the backing of the incumbent leonid kuchma .
however there are great misgivings about the fairness of the elections on the european side .
fears have been voiced that kuchma will do anything to keep his archrival viktor yushchenko out of power .
prodi warned that elections must be free and fair .
privately eu diplomats say the elections will be crucial in determining how relations develop in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 europe lifts gm food ban despite public opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the market for gm corn ?
the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2004 greens want eu-wide referendum on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- left -rrb- says eu voters should decide on the constitution .
as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .
she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .
i understand power as a grouping of different interests , " schwan has said . she 's also taken a jibe at rival köhler 's status by hinting that he was only an expert when it came to economics , given his imf background .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2004 greens want eu-wide referendum on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- left -rrb- says eu voters should decide on the constitution .
as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .
during is re-election campaign last year , chirac also pledged to hold a referendum on the issue . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european constitution read dw-world quick guide to the most important points in the draft constitution .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .
" it would have been more clever to come to an agreement earlier , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .

magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 europe lifts gm food ban despite public opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the market for gm corn ?
the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "

force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2004 greens want eu-wide referendum on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- left -rrb- says eu voters should decide on the constitution .
as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .

if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .
during is re-election campaign last year , chirac also pledged to hold a referendum on the issue . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european constitution read dw-world quick guide to the most important points in the draft constitution .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .

“ there is now a chance to make it possible for even rural and remote areas to have access to an energy source and to produce fuel , ” she says .
“ we are opening up a whole new field and the indian government is also observing the project with interest and is supporting the idea . ”
for the indian government , this development is a top priority .
the number of cars sold has tripled between 1994 and 2000 .
most vehicles and the indian railways need diesel fuel .
currently , the subcontinent relies heavily on diesel fuel imported from abroad .
but bio-diesel produced locally could soon be a viable alternative for modern engines .
the economic dimension initial results of the pilot project have been promising .
daimlerchrysler tested the first samples of bio-diesel taken from the jatropha plant in its laboratories in germany and found it to be of high quality .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .
" it would have been more clever to come to an agreement earlier , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
kahn said hitzfeld has reacted to the speculation with " unbelievable character and a lot of style . "

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .
she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .
i understand power as a grouping of different interests , " schwan has said . she 's also taken a jibe at rival köhler 's status by hinting that he was only an expert when it came to economics , given his imf background .

still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .
she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .
i understand power as a grouping of different interests , " schwan has said . she 's also taken a jibe at rival köhler 's status by hinting that he was only an expert when it came to economics , given his imf background .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .

for the indian government , this development is a top priority .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 europe lifts gm food ban despite public opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the market for gm corn ?
the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .

" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .
i understand power as a grouping of different interests , " schwan has said . she 's also taken a jibe at rival köhler 's status by hinting that he was only an expert when it came to economics , given his imf background .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2004 greens want eu-wide referendum on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- left -rrb- says eu voters should decide on the constitution .
as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .

thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .
during is re-election campaign last year , chirac also pledged to hold a referendum on the issue . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european constitution read dw-world quick guide to the most important points in the draft constitution .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .

in india , however , this is a new development .
“ there is now a chance to make it possible for even rural and remote areas to have access to an energy source and to produce fuel , ” she says .
“ we are opening up a whole new field and the indian government is also observing the project with interest and is supporting the idea . ”
for the indian government , this development is a top priority .
the number of cars sold has tripled between 1994 and 2000 .
most vehicles and the indian railways need diesel fuel .
currently , the subcontinent relies heavily on diesel fuel imported from abroad .
but bio-diesel produced locally could soon be a viable alternative for modern engines .
the economic dimension initial results of the pilot project have been promising .
daimlerchrysler tested the first samples of bio-diesel taken from the jatropha plant in its laboratories in germany and found it to be of high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler also has an economic interest in the project .
but daimlerchrysler would perhaps not be involved in this project without the backing of the german government .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .

in india , however , this is a new development .
“ there is now a chance to make it possible for even rural and remote areas to have access to an energy source and to produce fuel , ” she says .
“ we are opening up a whole new field and the indian government is also observing the project with interest and is supporting the idea . ”
for the indian government , this development is a top priority .
the number of cars sold has tripled between 1994 and 2000 .
most vehicles and the indian railways need diesel fuel .
currently , the subcontinent relies heavily on diesel fuel imported from abroad .
but bio-diesel produced locally could soon be a viable alternative for modern engines .
the economic dimension initial results of the pilot project have been promising .
daimlerchrysler tested the first samples of bio-diesel taken from the jatropha plant in its laboratories in germany and found it to be of high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler also has an economic interest in the project .
but daimlerchrysler would perhaps not be involved in this project without the backing of the german government .

one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .
" it would have been more clever to come to an agreement earlier , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
kahn said hitzfeld has reacted to the speculation with " unbelievable character and a lot of style . "
french middlefield player willy sagnol called hitzfeld 's treatment " bullshit " and said he would try and transfer to another club immediately .
hitzfeld 's successful run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld holds up the trophy after winning the champions league final match against valencia at the san siro stadium in milan , italy , wednesday , may 23 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / luca bruno -rrb- in six years at bayern , hitzfeld won the bundesliga title four times , the german cup twice , and the champion 's league title , which pits europe 's top clubs against each other .
but the club has faltered in the past two years , particularly on the european level .
an early and humiliating exit out of the champion 's league in 2002 as well as bayern 's inability to get into the semifinal round this may have been too much for bayern management .
the future nevertheless looks bright for hitzfeld .
the trainer has been rumored to be up for coaching jobs at chelsea london and real madrid .
the hottest tip is as german national team trainer should rudi völler 's boys put in a poor performance at this european championship this june in portugal .
hitzfeld himself says he has no plans after his team 's final game against sc freiburg this weekend .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .

indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural life in india .
in india , however , this is a new development .
“ there is now a chance to make it possible for even rural and remote areas to have access to an energy source and to produce fuel , ” she says .
“ we are opening up a whole new field and the indian government is also observing the project with interest and is supporting the idea . ”
for the indian government , this development is a top priority .
the number of cars sold has tripled between 1994 and 2000 .
most vehicles and the indian railways need diesel fuel .
currently , the subcontinent relies heavily on diesel fuel imported from abroad .
but bio-diesel produced locally could soon be a viable alternative for modern engines .
the economic dimension initial results of the pilot project have been promising .
daimlerchrysler tested the first samples of bio-diesel taken from the jatropha plant in its laboratories in germany and found it to be of high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler also has an economic interest in the project .
but daimlerchrysler would perhaps not be involved in this project without the backing of the german government .
the company is operating in india within the framework of a so-called “ public private partnership ” .
it can rely on funds provided by the state-owned german society for investment and development -lrb- deg -rrb- .
“ the deg supports this project by offering financial aid , which does not need to be refunded , ” deg ’ s peter peters explains .
“ without this support , daimlerchrysler would not be participating in the program .
we are assisting an existing development initiative of the company , which , for them has an economic dimension . ”
and the deg aid is an added incentive for daimlerchrysler .
“ what we do is say , ‘ you ’ ll get additional funding from us if you go out of your way to do more in the context of an existing project , ” says peters .
if india ’ s goal of turning jatropha into fuel becomes reality , it will result in both environmental and economic benefits for everyone involved . ana lehmann / heike grelka send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program .

he added that only two issues were outstanding , the level of bankruptcy and pricing .
yanukovych described the problem as " outdated " , and said that the issue must be solved at the summit .
the move would clear a major hurdle on ukraine 's path towards becoming a member of the world trade organisation .
yanukovych is tipped as a candidate to become the next ukrainian president and has the backing of the incumbent leonid kuchma .
however there are great misgivings about the fairness of the elections on the european side .
fears have been voiced that kuchma will do anything to keep his archrival viktor yushchenko out of power .
prodi warned that elections must be free and fair .
privately eu diplomats say the elections will be crucial in determining how relations develop in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 europe lifts gm food ban despite public opposition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the market for gm corn ?
the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2004 greens want eu-wide referendum on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- left -rrb- says eu voters should decide on the constitution .
as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .
during is re-election campaign last year , chirac also pledged to hold a referendum on the issue . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european constitution read dw-world quick guide to the most important points in the draft constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2004 greens want eu-wide referendum on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- left -rrb- says eu voters should decide on the constitution .
as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .
where 's the appetite ?
wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

wednesday 's decision will certainly please the united states , the world 's biggest producer of gm foods and the leader of a group of 12 countries petitioning the world trade organization to overturn the european ban and open up the eu for gm products .
what remains less certain , however , is who will actually buy the bio-engineered food .
a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .

a recent survey conducted by the eu shows that more than 70 percent of europeans are against so-called " frankenfoods . "
the advocacy group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- says there is virtually no market for gm foods in europe as consumers have overwhelmingly rejected them .
" where is the market for bt-11 , who 's going to buy it , " asked adrien bebb , a gm campaigner for the european branch of foe .
" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

the european commission defied public opinion and environmentalists on wednesday by giving the go-ahead to a swiss company to import the genetically modified sweet corn bt-11 , effectively lifting a five-year ban . since 1999 gm products have had a hard time making it to europe 's markets .
a ban on importing bio-engineered food made it nearly impossible for crops like the bt-11 sweet corn to land on supermarket shelves .
but now that is all set to change , and many companies are ready to start stocking gm food products , much to the disdain of the majority of europe 's consumers .
on wednesday the eu executive endorsed an application by swiss firm syngenta to import genetically modified maize into the 25-nation bloc , thus lifting the five-year moratorium .
" the bt-11 application was approved by the commission , " said beate gminder , a spokeswoman for eu health commissioner david byrne .
syngenta was given approval to import the gm tinned sweet corn into the eu for 10 years , provided the cans are clearly labeled as containing gm products .
a number of other companies are now hoping to follow close on the swiss firm 's heels , and the eu is currently examining 33 further applications for the breeding or cultivation and sale of gm crops in europe .
the eu commission , which has been at the forefront of calls for introducing gm crops to europe in recent years , was given the ultimate decision on whether to lift the ban after eu member states failed to break a deadlock on the issue last month .
despite public criticism and pressure from environmental lobbyists , only four of the now 30-member commission expressed any reservations about ending the ban .

" there certainly are n't going to be any rushes at the supermarket , " he told dw-world .
a hard pill to swallow ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : testing gm corn in the laboratory is not enough , say environmental groups .
environmentalists and consumer protection groups argue that the safety of gm products has yet to be conclusively proven .
the bt-11 sweet corn , for instance , is an insect and herbicide-resistant strain currently sold in the united states , but scientists still can not agree on its safety , said bebb .
some critics say the corn has been modified to produce a toxin and that the scientific tests of the strain were carried out under outdated regulations .
bebb told dw-world that before the corn can be sold in europe , " proper long-term testing is needed , and not just experiments in the lab . "
it is the responsibility of the commission to look after the safety of the public , he said , " not the financial interests of the biotechnology industry or its friends in the white house . "
" what is the commission there for if it does n't act in the interests of the public , " he added .
non-conclusive evidence the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- said such arguments were an insult to the eu 's food safety authority , which has declared bt-11 safe for human consumption .
" it is a slap in the face for the efsa , which has spent a tremendous amount of energy in conducting the safety evaluation , " europabio secretary-general johan vanhemelrijck told afp news agency .
" if there is no demand , the product will not be successful .
but if you do not give consumers a choice , and you claim there is no demand , then you are claiming something that can not be proven , " he said .
force-feeding the public ?
the commission argues that new rules placed on labeling and tracing gm foods should ensure that tough safeguards are carried out and help ease public concern .
the regulations , which took effect on april 18 , require food and animal feed to be labeled if they contain 0.9 percent or more of gm ingredients .
producers and buyers must also keep track of data concerning the origin , composition and sale of gm products for a five-year period .
but the regulations are " not the total solution " said bebb , who admitted that listing the contents of a food product will help inform the public , but it does n't change the fact that people not want gm food .
" if the commission decides to force this down our throats then they can only expect the public 's confidence in gm foods to sink even further , " he said ahead of the decision on wednesday .. dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament approves gene-food law the controversial law allows the growing of genetically-modified crops in germany while at the same time imposing strict penalties for possible violations of food-safety regulations .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .
" it would have been more clever to come to an agreement earlier , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
kahn said hitzfeld has reacted to the speculation with " unbelievable character and a lot of style . "
french middlefield player willy sagnol called hitzfeld 's treatment " bullshit " and said he would try and transfer to another club immediately .
hitzfeld 's successful run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld holds up the trophy after winning the champions league final match against valencia at the san siro stadium in milan , italy , wednesday , may 23 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / luca bruno -rrb- in six years at bayern , hitzfeld won the bundesliga title four times , the german cup twice , and the champion 's league title , which pits europe 's top clubs against each other .
but the club has faltered in the past two years , particularly on the european level .
an early and humiliating exit out of the champion 's league in 2002 as well as bayern 's inability to get into the semifinal round this may have been too much for bayern management .
the future nevertheless looks bright for hitzfeld .
the trainer has been rumored to be up for coaching jobs at chelsea london and real madrid .
the hottest tip is as german national team trainer should rudi völler 's boys put in a poor performance at this european championship this june in portugal .
hitzfeld himself says he has no plans after his team 's final game against sc freiburg this weekend .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .

as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.05.2004 greens want eu-wide referendum on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mep daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- left -rrb- says eu voters should decide on the constitution .
as a growing number of european union countries decide to hold national referendums on the bloc 's draft constitution , leading european greens politicians are beginning to call for an eu-wide vote . britain will do it and france may too , but daniel cohn-bendit , the german green party 's top candidate for elections to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- elections in june , says it 's wrong .
if people are asked to cast ballots in countrywide referendums on accepting the european constitution they will inevitably be swayed by national interests , the french-german politician claims .
the eu should instead stage a single uniform vote throughout the bloc . the problem could be solved if " all peoples in all member states were presented with the same question from brussels on the same day to vote on , " cohn-bendit , who currently holds a seat in the ep as a french green , told the rheinische post newspaper .
if at the same time a majority of registered eu voters and a majority in three-quarters of the 25 member states said " yes " to the constitution , the document should be considered accepted , he suggested . germany would only need to add a law to its constitution - which does not provide for referendums - allowing them when the eu requires it , cohn-bendit suggested .
thus , germany could avoid arousing a debate about national referendums without actually prescribing eu ones . with cohn-bendit at the helm , the greens are the only party campaigning for ep elections with a joint platform throughout its european parties .
although a draft treaty of the european constitution was completed last year , eu member states have been unable to agree on key points , particularly voting rights , and continue trying to iron out differences . just as democratic german chancellor gerhard schröder has repeatedly ruled out holding a referendum on the constitution , saying that the country 's approval process via parliamentary vote was " equally as democratic " as putting the issue to the people in a popular vote .
although he vowed to introduce referendums before taking office , he has n't pursued the issue further , and it 's unlikely that he could muster a two-thirds majority in the two houses of parliament necessary to change the constitution . that 's not to say that cohn-bendit 's proposal will fall on deaf ears in berlin .
indeed , days after uk prime minister tony blair 's decision in april to hold a referendum on the constitution , austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel brought up the idea in a talk show on german television .
he said that individual national referendums are n't " clever " because they get tied up with domestic politics . " that 's a big risk because domestic politics could very easily get mixed up with a fundamental european question and that is always dangerous , " schüssel said .
" the solution may really be that after the ratification by national parliaments ... that we then jointly on one day in the whole of europe put the question to the european population .
then no one can say it was done over the heads of the people . " the idea found resonance with german finance minister hans eichel , too .
" i could imagine the whole of europe holding a referendum , " eichel told public broadcaster zdf .
" i do n't think it 's sensible if individual countries do it and then one gets … nationalist tendencies that can pit people against each other . "
france undecided france , where referendums are relatively common , has not yet decided whether to put the constitution to a popular vote though french president jacques chirac has been under pressure to do so . " in france , -lrb- referendums -rrb- are the rule .
i do n't see how we can deprive people of the right to have a say .
it would be a denial of democracy , " socialist pierre moscovici , a former european affairs minister , told libération newspaper .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .

magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .

after six years as one of bayern munich 's most successful trainers , and months of speculation over his fate , ottmar hitzfeld said monday he was being forced to leave germany 's top club after this weekend . hitzfeld , 55 , said tuesday that he had accepted the decision of bayern management to cancel his contract , one year before it was to expire .
" it was a lovely time , and the positives prevailed , " hitzfeld said after his team beat a hungarian club 4:1 tuesday night in a friendship game in györ .
bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .
" it would have been more clever to come to an agreement earlier , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
kahn said hitzfeld has reacted to the speculation with " unbelievable character and a lot of style . "
french middlefield player willy sagnol called hitzfeld 's treatment " bullshit " and said he would try and transfer to another club immediately .
hitzfeld 's successful run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld holds up the trophy after winning the champions league final match against valencia at the san siro stadium in milan , italy , wednesday , may 23 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / luca bruno -rrb- in six years at bayern , hitzfeld won the bundesliga title four times , the german cup twice , and the champion 's league title , which pits europe 's top clubs against each other .
but the club has faltered in the past two years , particularly on the european level .
an early and humiliating exit out of the champion 's league in 2002 as well as bayern 's inability to get into the semifinal round this may have been too much for bayern management .
the future nevertheless looks bright for hitzfeld .
the trainer has been rumored to be up for coaching jobs at chelsea london and real madrid .

the ' no ' side appears stable at 36 percent according to the poll - published by nrk and aftenposten .
the survey of 1,000 individuals was conducted by the opinion institute between may 10 and may 12 .
the latest enlargement of the eu with 10 new member states entering the union in may 1 is widely thought to be the main reason for the rise of the ' yes ' side .
norway has twice rejected eu membership in referendums - in 1972 and in 1994 .
it is expected that the norwegian eu debate will heat up again in the run-up to the next election , which will be held in september 2005 .

monti said on monday that a tentative agreeement had been reached that would not contravene the eu 's state aid laws .
if the deal is indeed permitted , the french government would become the largest shareholder in the company .
but the moves are being viewed with dismay in some quarters in germany , especially by siemens - germany 's own industrial giant - which was hoping to acquire assets in alstom .
french determination to keep alstom in the hands of the government threatens to undermine a franco-german plan to create " european industrial champions , " fleshed out at a recent meeting between french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural life in india .
in india , however , this is a new development .
“ there is now a chance to make it possible for even rural and remote areas to have access to an energy source and to produce fuel , ” she says .
“ we are opening up a whole new field and the indian government is also observing the project with interest and is supporting the idea . ”
for the indian government , this development is a top priority .
the number of cars sold has tripled between 1994 and 2000 .
most vehicles and the indian railways need diesel fuel .
currently , the subcontinent relies heavily on diesel fuel imported from abroad .
but bio-diesel produced locally could soon be a viable alternative for modern engines .
the economic dimension initial results of the pilot project have been promising .
daimlerchrysler tested the first samples of bio-diesel taken from the jatropha plant in its laboratories in germany and found it to be of high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler also has an economic interest in the project .
but daimlerchrysler would perhaps not be involved in this project without the backing of the german government .
the company is operating in india within the framework of a so-called “ public private partnership ” .
it can rely on funds provided by the state-owned german society for investment and development -lrb- deg -rrb- .
“ the deg supports this project by offering financial aid , which does not need to be refunded , ” deg ’ s peter peters explains .
“ without this support , daimlerchrysler would not be participating in the program .
we are assisting an existing development initiative of the company , which , for them has an economic dimension . ”

india is increasingly depending on expensive imports of crude oil .
because of this , the indian government has declared the development of bio-diesel a national priority .
german know-how is helping to achieve this goal . in the indian state of orissa , jatropha bushes stand in long rows on the dry brown soil of plantations .
jatropha , a hardy and robust plant species , can grow up to 10 feet high and survives with very little water .
most importantly , though , the nuts within the fleshy fruit contain oil - and this can be turned into high-quality diesel fuel .
indian scientists are trying to do just this , with the support of experts from the german-u.s. automobile giant daimlerchrysler and german researchers from the university of hohenheim .
in a five-year project , they want to prove that environment-friendly bio-diesel can be produced in india in adequate quantities using the jatropha plant .
“ the aim of this project is the sustainable production of bio-diesel on eroded land in india , ” daimlerchrysler ’ s karin thieman explains .
“ in india , we see the chance to support the production of locally produced eco-friendly fuel , which is carbon dioxide neutral . ”
jatropha bio-diesel contains no sulfur and is thus a clean , low-emission fuel .
a top priority according to thieman , daimlerchrysler has already been able to gather some experience with bio-diesel in germany .
“ there is a market there and you can buy it at many petrol stations , ” she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rural life in india .
in india , however , this is a new development .
“ there is now a chance to make it possible for even rural and remote areas to have access to an energy source and to produce fuel , ” she says .
“ we are opening up a whole new field and the indian government is also observing the project with interest and is supporting the idea . ”
for the indian government , this development is a top priority .
the number of cars sold has tripled between 1994 and 2000 .
most vehicles and the indian railways need diesel fuel .
currently , the subcontinent relies heavily on diesel fuel imported from abroad .
but bio-diesel produced locally could soon be a viable alternative for modern engines .
the economic dimension initial results of the pilot project have been promising .
daimlerchrysler tested the first samples of bio-diesel taken from the jatropha plant in its laboratories in germany and found it to be of high quality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler also has an economic interest in the project .

monti said on monday that a tentative agreeement had been reached that would not contravene the eu 's state aid laws .
if the deal is indeed permitted , the french government would become the largest shareholder in the company .
but the moves are being viewed with dismay in some quarters in germany , especially by siemens - germany 's own industrial giant - which was hoping to acquire assets in alstom .
french determination to keep alstom in the hands of the government threatens to undermine a franco-german plan to create " european industrial champions , " fleshed out at a recent meeting between french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

the results of the probe published on wednesday , confirmed that a swiss-based air traffic controller noticed too late that a cargo plane and a russian charter airline filled with schoolchildren were on a collision course before they slammed into each other on july 1 , 2002 .
the report said the controller issued his first instructions only 43 seconds before the crash .
the russian crew obeyed the controller , sending the jetliner with 69 people aboard straight into the dhl plane .
" this accident happened because many actions and failures to act came together that , viewed on their own , might only have a small significance for air safety , " the german investigators said .
swiss air traffic control company skyguide apologized in reaction to the german report .
" skyguide accepts full responsibility for its errors , and extends it sincere apologies to the relatives of the 71 individuals who lost their lives , " the company said . more briefs 19.05.2004 -pipe- prison for policeman with handbag fetish 18.05.2004 -pipe- schröder slapped by angry man at party meeting 18.05.2004 -pipe- german prosecutors say algerian terror leader captured 18.05.2004 -pipe- bayern munich 's coach gets the ax 18.05.2004 -pipe- deutsche oper director quits over money 17.05.2004 -pipe- critics impressed by german film at cannes 17.05.2004 -pipe- sasser informer reportedly under investigation 17.05.2004 -pipe- report shows drop in right-wing extremism radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .
she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .

she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .

imf chief köhler looks set to become next german president choosing germany 's next president horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president germany -pipe- 19.05.2004 top female academic aims for presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart and tough as nails stirring faint hope that germany might yet get its first female president , gesine schwan , schröder 's presidential candidate , has surprisingly caught up with opposition-backed horst köhler in opinion polls . when 60-year-old gesine schwan was plucked from her job as president of the viadrina european university in frankfurt an der oder earlier this year by the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens and sent into the presidential race , the move was considered to be merely symbolic . since the joint parliamentary assembly that will elect germany 's next president on may 23 is controlled by the opposition conservatives and liberals , schwan was thought to have no chance of beating opposition candidate horst köhler , the former managing director of the international monetary fund . schwan woos with intelligence but , less than two months later , the eloquent schwan , with her trademark mop of blond curls , has proven to be a candidate to reckon with . a rash of opinion polls published this week by diverse polling institutes concluded that it would be a neck-and-neck race between schwan and köhler if the germans directly elected their president .
one poll carried out by the emnid institute for the daily die welt said 40 percent of the people questioned would vote for schwan , while 38 percent were for köhler . schwan would have to pick up 19 votes from the opposition if she were to win on sunday - a near impossible feat .
still , the about-turn in opinion polls has surprised pundits who attribute it to her combination of intelligence , media savvy , and formidable verbal skills which she has demonstrated in numerous television appearances . schwan has also untiringly crisscrossed the country in recent months to give campaign speeches in which she consistently emphasized her intention to focus on education , research , and family affairs if chosen to succeed president johannes rau . long-running ties to poland born in berlin on may 22 , 1943 , schwan grew up in a socially-committed family that was part of the resistance movement against the nazis and later became involved in polish-german reconciliation after the war . schwan studied romance languages , history , philosophy and political science in berlin and freiburg .
as a student , she spent much time in warsaw and krakow and developed contacts to several polish dissidents who today work as high-ranking politicians . she joined the social democratic party in 1972 and proved to be a passionate debater who propagated détente towards communist regimes as a means of working towards democratization .
she was appointed director of the viadrina european university on the german-polish border in 1999 , a post that was considered ideal given her contribution to german-polish relations . finding favor among intellectuals though the german president 's role is largely limited to ceremonial state visits , signing laws and being a kind of moral conscience for society , schwan 's forceful personality and views are already beginning to find resonance among germans . this week , a broad grouping of artists , intellectuals , scientists and politicians published a full-page advertisement in a german daily , supporting schwan 's candidacy .
" our broad alliance is not just in favor of a woman becoming the president , we 're also supporting gesine schwan as a highly-qualified candidate who is seen by the majority of germans as the better federal president , " well-known artist klaus staeck , one of the campaign 's initiators , told news agency dpa . a widowed mother of two , schwan has also shrewdly played her card as a tough female politician .
" i have a lot of experience as a woman caught between a job and a family .
i understand power as a grouping of different interests , " schwan has said . she 's also taken a jibe at rival köhler 's status by hinting that he was only an expert when it came to economics , given his imf background .
" politics must be more than economics , " schwan said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de horst köhler profile : a financial diplomat for president if elected by the federal convention , horst köhler will become germany 's ninth postwar president .

bayern 's management , which had shown itself divided over whether hitzfeld should stay , said it had already signed vfb stuttgart coach felix magath to a contract beginning july 1 , 2005 , but wanted him earlier than that .
stuttgart is currently in third place behind bayern in the standings ahead of the last game of the season .
hoeness : team did n't fight for hitzfeld manager uli hoeness , long one of hitzfeld 's biggest fans , was the last to relent to the bayern brass after a disappointing season in which bayern came home with no silverware .
following dinner with hitzfeld and his wife monday night , hoeness ended weeks of speculation in the german press that began after bayern lost a game and the bundesliga title to werder bremen 1:3 two weeks ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness " had the team showed against werder that they wanted to attack once more with this trainer , then we would have waited another year , " said hoeness in an interview with spiegel online .
hoeness then took issue with hitzfeld 's training style , saying he was too lax with the players .
magath , he said , would bring in the necessary discipline and " pay no attention to names . "
players : coach did n't get enough respect the " names , " among the most talented and best paid in germany and europe , reacted angrily to the way in which bayern management reached their decision .
they said hitzfeld , a player favorite , was n't treated with enough respect .
" it would have been more clever to come to an agreement earlier , " said goalkeeper oliver kahn .
kahn said hitzfeld has reacted to the speculation with " unbelievable character and a lot of style . "
french middlefield player willy sagnol called hitzfeld 's treatment " bullshit " and said he would try and transfer to another club immediately .

the centre , in hertfordshire , contains two stem cell lines developed by teams at king 's college london and the centre for life in newcastle .
stem cells offer hope of new ways to repair and replace diseased and damaged body tissues .
while scientists support the research , opponents say it is unethical and unnecessary to use cells from embryos in this way .
this potentially revolutionary research could benefit thousands of patients .
lord warner the need for a stem cell bank however , even proponents admit that a huge amount of research is needed to understand exactly how stem cells work and how their potential can be harnessed for treatments for conditions such as diabetes , cancer , parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
stem cells are the body 's master cells , with the potential to become many different types of tissue .
the bank is funded by the medical research council -lrb- mrc -rrb- and the biotechnology and biological sciences research council -lrb- bbsrc -rrb- .
run by the national institute for biological standards and control -lrb- nibsc -rrb- , it will be responsible for storing , characterising and supplying ethically approved , quality controlled stem cell lines for research and ultimately for treatment .
different sources the cell lines are derived from stem cells which continue to multiply and reproduce themselves indefinitely .
the bank will hold stem cell lines derived originally from embryonic , foetal and adult tissues .
applications to deposit stem cell lines in the bank or to access banked stem cell lines must be reviewed and authorised by a high level steering committee .
it reduces human life to little more than a pharmaceutical product .
patrick cusworth health minister lord warner said : " this bank is the first of its kind in the world and confirms the uk 's position as a leader in stem cell research .
" this potentially revolutionary research could benefit thousands of patients whose lives are blighted by devastating diseases such as parkinson 's , stroke and alzheimer 's . "
professor colin blakemore , chief executive of the mrc , said stem cell research offered real promise for the treatment of currently incurable diseases .
he said : " the bank will ensure that researchers can explore the enormous potential of this exciting science for the future benefit of patients . "
professor julia goodfellow , bbsrc chief executive , said : " stem cell therapy will remain a dream unless we can understand and control the processes that switch these cells into specialised types such as brain or pancreas cells .
" the bank will help us to achieve this by providing isolated and well-characterised cells for research . "
critics anti-abortion groups have voiced opposition to the bank , arguing the extraction of stem cells from human embryos is unethical .
patrick cusworth , of the charity life , said : " the practice of creating human embryos for destructive research is immoral for two reasons .
" first , it reduces human life to little more than a pharmaceutical product .
secondly , it holds out false hopes of cures for sufferers of dehabilitating conditions .
" the irony is that there is a better alternative to embryonic stem cells .
" experiments using adult stem cells , that is , stem cells taken from various sources in the patient 's own body , and cells taken from discarded umbilical cords , have already proved remarkably effective . "
a spokesman for the prolife party said it was wrong to produce and market stem cells obtained through " the sacrifice of early human life " .
" the smug glee of uk science and the government as it officially opens its pioneer stem cell bank , is not shared by the worldwide pro-life movement or anybody who believes that medical cures may never be advanced if their development depends on unethical practice .
" taking one human life in this way to save another is not morally licit . "

the centre , in hertfordshire , contains two stem cell lines developed by teams at king 's college london and the centre for life in newcastle .
stem cells offer hope of new ways to repair and replace diseased and damaged body tissues .
while scientists support the research , opponents say it is unethical and unnecessary to use cells from embryos in this way .
this potentially revolutionary research could benefit thousands of patients .
lord warner the need for a stem cell bank however , even proponents admit that a huge amount of research is needed to understand exactly how stem cells work and how their potential can be harnessed for treatments for conditions such as diabetes , cancer , parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
stem cells are the body 's master cells , with the potential to become many different types of tissue .
the bank is funded by the medical research council -lrb- mrc -rrb- and the biotechnology and biological sciences research council -lrb- bbsrc -rrb- .
run by the national institute for biological standards and control -lrb- nibsc -rrb- , it will be responsible for storing , characterising and supplying ethically approved , quality controlled stem cell lines for research and ultimately for treatment .
different sources the cell lines are derived from stem cells which continue to multiply and reproduce themselves indefinitely .
the bank will hold stem cell lines derived originally from embryonic , foetal and adult tissues .
applications to deposit stem cell lines in the bank or to access banked stem cell lines must be reviewed and authorised by a high level steering committee .
it reduces human life to little more than a pharmaceutical product .
patrick cusworth health minister lord warner said : " this bank is the first of its kind in the world and confirms the uk 's position as a leader in stem cell research .
" this potentially revolutionary research could benefit thousands of patients whose lives are blighted by devastating diseases such as parkinson 's , stroke and alzheimer 's . "
professor colin blakemore , chief executive of the mrc , said stem cell research offered real promise for the treatment of currently incurable diseases .
he said : " the bank will ensure that researchers can explore the enormous potential of this exciting science for the future benefit of patients . "
professor julia goodfellow , bbsrc chief executive , said : " stem cell therapy will remain a dream unless we can understand and control the processes that switch these cells into specialised types such as brain or pancreas cells .
" the bank will help us to achieve this by providing isolated and well-characterised cells for research . "
critics anti-abortion groups have voiced opposition to the bank , arguing the extraction of stem cells from human embryos is unethical .
patrick cusworth , of the charity life , said : " the practice of creating human embryos for destructive research is immoral for two reasons .
" first , it reduces human life to little more than a pharmaceutical product .
secondly , it holds out false hopes of cures for sufferers of dehabilitating conditions .
" the irony is that there is a better alternative to embryonic stem cells .
" experiments using adult stem cells , that is , stem cells taken from various sources in the patient 's own body , and cells taken from discarded umbilical cords , have already proved remarkably effective . "
a spokesman for the prolife party said it was wrong to produce and market stem cells obtained through " the sacrifice of early human life " .
" the smug glee of uk science and the government as it officially opens its pioneer stem cell bank , is not shared by the worldwide pro-life movement or anybody who believes that medical cures may never be advanced if their development depends on unethical practice .
" taking one human life in this way to save another is not morally licit . "

many americans panic as petrol prices rise above $ 2 a gallon so it is with president bush now .
so it was with president clinton in the autumn of 2000 .
the asset in question is oil in the form of the strategic petroleum reserve .
with fuel prices at the pump bumping what is for americans an outrageous $ 2 -lrb- £ 1.13 -rrb- a gallon , the temptation might be for mr bush to put the odd million barrels of the national reserve on the market to ease prices and voters ' pain .
after all , the clinton administration released 30 million barrels two months before vice president al gore stood - on the democrats ' economic record - against george w bush four years ago .
little good did it do mr gore .
firstly , he lost .
secondly , the price of crude oil did drop - from $ 37 a barrel to $ 30 a barrel in the first few days , but then rose back to $ 36 a barrel .
it then fell nicely because of other factors until , after the election , it was down to $ 32 a barrel .
the lesson for politicians : markets are wiser than you think .
not that mr bush seems to need to learn that .
he is , apparently , resistant to the idea of using the strategic petroleum reserve to manipulate oil prices downwards , despite the urgings of democrats .
political sparring mr bush ordered that the reserve be built up after 11 september 2001 as a buffer against cataclysmic global events .
the reserve is currently just below 660 million barrels but the aim is to raise it to 700 million barrels next year .
tighter economic times for customers and stores mean tighter political times for mr bush perhaps , mr bush knows that any release of oil would be a drop in the ocean and unlikely to have any lasting effect .
perhaps , democrats know that too , but also know a good political cause when they see one .
john kerry , their contender , is being more cautious than his party colleagues .
he wants no increase in the size of the reserve , but he is not calling for a cut either .
rising costs it is true that the price of oil will depend on politics , but on politics far from washington .
the big factor will be the violent street politics of iraq rather than the softer brand that accompanies an american election campaign .
the gulf produces 70 % of the world 's oil , so any destruction of installations there will push prices higher .
petrol pump politics in the us will follow politics in iraq .
already , there is some political pain in the us .
apart from a rise in the petrol price to above $ 2 gallon - a level regarded as high by americans - companies are pushing up prices to cover rising fuel costs .
wal-mart , the world 's biggest retailer , has warned that its customers could be spending perhaps $ 7 a week more on fuel because of the rises .
and that means less spent on its goods .
tighter economic times for customers and stores mean tighter political times for mr bush .
moreover , rising oil prices can do nothing to keep inflation dead and buried with what we thought was a stake through its heart .
for a decade , ever sharpening competition led to the belief that relentlessly rising prices were a strange concept confined to history books .
now , the word , if not the thing itself , is back .
rising or falling ?
however , we should not be too gloomy .
there have been three big spikes in the price of oil in the last 50 years : after the arab-israeli war 30 years ago ; after the iranian revolution in 1979 ; and after the gulf war of 1991 .
there 's unlikely to be any cutting of the " terrorism premium " each time , the high price of oil was followed by a recession .
this time , the real price of oil is not high by comparison , once inflation is taken into account .
according to deutsche bank , " it would be wrong to assume that the current nominal oil price is extreme " .
" indeed , in real terms , prices are only 6 % above their 1971-2003 average , " the bank says .
prices are high relative to the recent past , but only at the levels last witnessed four years ago .
the question is whether they are on the way up or down .
political uncertainty it has to be said that the risks are on the up side .
few expect the uncertainty in the middle east to diminish in the near future so there is unlikely to be any cutting of the " terrorism premium " .
the petroleum exporting cartel opec may increase production somewhat but it is not far from capacity now .
similarly , refineries in the us are working at near to full tilt .
in the longer term , matters look even tighter .
it is estimated that the global use of oil will rise by 50 % in the next 20 years .
much of that extra demand will come in china and india .
the most doleful will note that most of the world 's political tension today stems from conflicts over resources either water or oil .
political uncertainty is unlikely to diminish .

if the mersey tunnels bill is passed , merseytravel will be able to increase tolls and use the profits elsewhere .
but campaigners against the bill say it is unfair , saying it is " a tax on people going to work " .
public opposition to the bill is being marshalled by the mersey tunnels users association -lrb- mtua -rrb- , formed last year .
' motorists hard-hit ' mtua , who do not affiliate themselves to any particular political party , already has 5,000 members .
" this will turn the whole length of the river mersey into a psychological and economic berlin wall , " a spokesman said .

the call has been prompted by a spate of deaths in inverness .
a support organisation has been launched after seven people committed suicide in the city in the last month .
the highlands and islands support group for grieving families said more investigation was needed to shed light on the problem .
it wants action to prevent more young men in particular killing themselves .
the majority of the cases were men in their early 40s .
neil gillies founded the support group last year in dingwall , ross-shire , after his son was killed by a car in 1999 .
exceptional circumstances mr gillies said the bereaved families of the latest suicides wanted answers in the aftermath of the tragic events .
he said : " the only way we are going to get that and find out what is happening is by fatal accident inquiries , which the families are demanding now . "
in scotland , fatal accident inquiries into suspected suicides are only called in exceptional circumstances .
the support group said fai-style inquiries should be carried out to establish the causes of death and identify any patterns of behaviour .
but some public health officials are not convinced a move towards an inquest system like in england would be the right way forward .
cameron stark , consultant in public health with nhs highland , said : " there is work in england that over 40 % of people bereaved by suicide experience problems with the coroner 's inquiry system .
" some detailed interviews indicate that many families feel they have been failed by the system . "
figures last year showed that young scottish men are more likely to commit suicide than their english counterparts .
the scottish executive has said it plans to tackle the problem by addressing a lack of social support .

he said : " the only way we are going to get that and find out what is happening is by fatal accident inquiries , which the families are demanding now . "
in scotland , fatal accident inquiries into suspected suicides are only called in exceptional circumstances .
mr gillies says families need more answers the support group said fai-style inquiries should be carried out to establish the causes of death and identify any patterns of behaviour .
but some public health officials are not convinced a move towards an inquest system like in england would be the right way forward .
cameron stark , consultant in public health with nhs highland , said : " there is work in england that over 40 % of people bereaved by suicide experience problems with the coroner 's inquiry system .
" some detailed interviews indicate that many families feel they have been failed by the system . "
figures last year showed that young scottish men are more likely to commit suicide than their english counterparts .
the scottish executive has said it plans to tackle the problem by addressing a lack of social support .

an investment boom and soaring consumer demand meant the first three months of 2004 saw annual growth rates of 9.8 % .
china 's response - curbing bank lending and spending on construction and other hot sectors - is working , said vice-premier huang ju .
but observers warn that rising inflation means interest rates are still likely to have to go up .
and even mr huang acknowledged that the rapid pace of growth experienced during the past year was not going to slow down immediately .
the 9.8 % first quarter growth number marked a fresh economic spurt , even faster than the 2003 growth rate of 9.1 % .
inflation fears of more concern is the jump in consumer prices , up 3.8 % in april on the same month a year ago , for the fastest rise in seven years .
the government has suggested that inflation will only become a major problem if it reaches 5 % .
and for the moment , said central bank governor zhou xiaochuan , it is merely " monitoring " the situation .
but analysts think that a change of interest rates is inevitable .
" i think they still need to raise interest rates , mainly because real interest rates are negative , " said michael spencer , chief economist at deutsche bank in hong kong .
" i do n't expect inflation is going to fall back below 2 % . "
but higher rates could spell trouble for many of china 's highly indebted companies , and could choke off consumer demand .
fears about the impact of a rate rise in china - allied with expectations that the us is also on the verge of raising the cost of borrowing from its current half-century low - were one factor in sharp falls on global stock markets earlier this month .
