rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .
-lrb- february 18 , 2004 -rrb- feedback if a decision is made to lower and enforce the restrictions on the german autobahn , what , in your opinion , would be a fair speed limit ?

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
“ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil .
völler to address row on london visit " jens has gone too far , " national coach völler told reporters on thursday .
" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .
i do n't want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international -lrb- match -rrb- . "
hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .
" i would not tolerate it at bayern if the reserve goalkeeper was to speak about kahn that way , " he told a news conference on thursday .
der kaiser adds his own views bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer adds his weight to the argument .
the severity of the row has reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one and captain .

the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .

" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .

prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son . wolfgang daschner , who has since been moved to an administrative post within the state interior ministry , is being charged with " serious coercion . "
the detective whom he asked to threaten a suspect is facing similar charges , according to prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daschner maintains threats were necessary to locate the boy daschner allegedly ordered officers to threaten the suspected kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , magnus gäfgen , with " intense pain " during questioning in october 2002 .
gäfgen , who had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts , immediately told officers where he had hid jakob 's body and belongings after the threats .
a frankfurt judge sentenced gäfgen , who had kidnapped the boy sept .
27 , 2002 and received € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.26 million -rrb- in ransom money , to 15 years to life in prison on july 29 , 2003 .
torture threats a serious crime reports of the alleged torture threats sparked a debate in germany when they first came out in january 2003 .
torture in any form is illegal in germany and can be punished by up to 10 years in prison .
the judge in the gäfgen case , however , said the torture allegations did not affect his ruling on the convicted murderer 's guilt .
" with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " judge hans bachl told the court at the time .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . "
prosecutors immediately launched an investigation into the incident and daschner was temporarily suspended .
deputy chief says threats were crucial to finding boy the 50-year-old police veteran has defended his actions .
he said his threats to employ a martial arts expert to hurt gäfgen were necessary to locate jakob , who police believed was still alive .
gäfgen told them after his confession that he had killed the boy four days before police found the body on oct .
2 , 2002 .
he was backed initially by frankfurt police chief harald weiss-bollandt .
but weiss-bollandt dropped his support as prosecutors began gathering evidence .
international human rights organizations , like amnesty international , as well as the police union , have greeted the decision by frankfurt 's chief prosecutor .
" we hope that the decision will also make clear that torture , in any case and without restraint , is not allowed and will continue not to be allowed , " said wolfgang genz of amnesty international germany , according to wire reports . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer convicted , police under fire for torture police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .

" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
“ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil .
völler to address row on london visit " jens has gone too far , " national coach völler told reporters on thursday .
" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .
i do n't want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international -lrb- match -rrb- . "
hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .
" i would not tolerate it at bayern if the reserve goalkeeper was to speak about kahn that way , " he told a news conference on thursday .
der kaiser adds his own views bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer adds his weight to the argument .
the severity of the row has reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one and captain .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said beckenbauer " rudi völler has to consider this carefully and act accordingly , " the world cup-winning captain and coach wrote in a column in friday 's mass-circulation bild daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last minute goal saves germany embarrassment substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer .
-lrb- february 19 , 2004 -rrb- feedback is it time for oliver kahn to step aside ?
comparing the form of their club sides , maybe lehmann has a point .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .

following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .
the prince threatened to crash the ball , and bring american socialite and hotel heiress paris hilton -lrb- photo -rrb- as his guest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "

german police officers in the western city of aachen thought they had been the victims of a hoax call when they turned up at the home of a man who had called for their assistance . banging on the door of the house for some time without answer , the police were about to leave when the occupant , a heavily-chained man dressed only in shiny black leather and white socks , appeared at the window .
the incapacitated bondage fetishist then managed to drop the keys to the front door out of the window using his teeth .
on entering the building , the police found that the man had been so heavily bound that he was unable to walk .
he then shuffled over to them on his knees with his head bowed in what officers at the scene called the manner of a penguin .
" to visualize the appearance of the afflicted party , one would have to imagine a penguin of waist-height waddling with slightly protruding wings , " aachen police said in a statement .
" we thought it was a joke at first but the chains were bound so tight with handcuffs he could hardly move anything apart from his head . "
after the officers released his handcuffs with their own keys , the man was told that he should use a specialized establishment rather than practice at home .
" we suggested in future that he go to places where that sort of thing might cost a bit more , but would definitely be safer for him , " the spokesperson said .
the police refused to speculate on how the man became ensnared . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on entering the building , the police found that the man had been so heavily bound that he was unable to walk .
he then shuffled over to them on his knees with his head bowed in what officers at the scene called the manner of a penguin .
" to visualize the appearance of the afflicted party , one would have to imagine a penguin of waist-height waddling with slightly protruding wings , " aachen police said in a statement .
" we thought it was a joke at first but the chains were bound so tight with handcuffs he could hardly move anything apart from his head . "
after the officers released his handcuffs with their own keys , the man was told that he should use a specialized establishment rather than practice at home .
" we suggested in future that he go to places where that sort of thing might cost a bit more , but would definitely be safer for him , " the spokesperson said .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
“ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil .

" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .
i do n't want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international -lrb- match -rrb- . "
hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .

prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son . wolfgang daschner , who has since been moved to an administrative post within the state interior ministry , is being charged with " serious coercion . "
the detective whom he asked to threaten a suspect is facing similar charges , according to prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daschner maintains threats were necessary to locate the boy daschner allegedly ordered officers to threaten the suspected kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , magnus gäfgen , with " intense pain " during questioning in october 2002 .
gäfgen , who had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts , immediately told officers where he had hid jakob 's body and belongings after the threats .
a frankfurt judge sentenced gäfgen , who had kidnapped the boy sept .
27 , 2002 and received € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.26 million -rrb- in ransom money , to 15 years to life in prison on july 29 , 2003 .
torture threats a serious crime reports of the alleged torture threats sparked a debate in germany when they first came out in january 2003 .
torture in any form is illegal in germany and can be punished by up to 10 years in prison .
the judge in the gäfgen case , however , said the torture allegations did not affect his ruling on the convicted murderer 's guilt .
" with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " judge hans bachl told the court at the time .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . "
prosecutors immediately launched an investigation into the incident and daschner was temporarily suspended .
deputy chief says threats were crucial to finding boy the 50-year-old police veteran has defended his actions .
he said his threats to employ a martial arts expert to hurt gäfgen were necessary to locate jakob , who police believed was still alive .
gäfgen told them after his confession that he had killed the boy four days before police found the body on oct .
2 , 2002 .
he was backed initially by frankfurt police chief harald weiss-bollandt .
but weiss-bollandt dropped his support as prosecutors began gathering evidence .
international human rights organizations , like amnesty international , as well as the police union , have greeted the decision by frankfurt 's chief prosecutor .
" we hope that the decision will also make clear that torture , in any case and without restraint , is not allowed and will continue not to be allowed , " said wolfgang genz of amnesty international germany , according to wire reports . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer convicted , police under fire for torture police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .

following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "

prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son . wolfgang daschner , who has since been moved to an administrative post within the state interior ministry , is being charged with " serious coercion . "
the detective whom he asked to threaten a suspect is facing similar charges , according to prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daschner maintains threats were necessary to locate the boy daschner allegedly ordered officers to threaten the suspected kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , magnus gäfgen , with " intense pain " during questioning in october 2002 .
gäfgen , who had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts , immediately told officers where he had hid jakob 's body and belongings after the threats .
a frankfurt judge sentenced gäfgen , who had kidnapped the boy sept .
27 , 2002 and received € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.26 million -rrb- in ransom money , to 15 years to life in prison on july 29 , 2003 .
torture threats a serious crime reports of the alleged torture threats sparked a debate in germany when they first came out in january 2003 .
torture in any form is illegal in germany and can be punished by up to 10 years in prison .
the judge in the gäfgen case , however , said the torture allegations did not affect his ruling on the convicted murderer 's guilt .
" with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " judge hans bachl told the court at the time .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . "
prosecutors immediately launched an investigation into the incident and daschner was temporarily suspended .
deputy chief says threats were crucial to finding boy the 50-year-old police veteran has defended his actions .
he said his threats to employ a martial arts expert to hurt gäfgen were necessary to locate jakob , who police believed was still alive .
gäfgen told them after his confession that he had killed the boy four days before police found the body on oct .
2 , 2002 .
he was backed initially by frankfurt police chief harald weiss-bollandt .
but weiss-bollandt dropped his support as prosecutors began gathering evidence .
international human rights organizations , like amnesty international , as well as the police union , have greeted the decision by frankfurt 's chief prosecutor .
" we hope that the decision will also make clear that torture , in any case and without restraint , is not allowed and will continue not to be allowed , " said wolfgang genz of amnesty international germany , according to wire reports . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer convicted , police under fire for torture police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .

each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .

she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .

german police officers in the western city of aachen thought they had been the victims of a hoax call when they turned up at the home of a man who had called for their assistance . banging on the door of the house for some time without answer , the police were about to leave when the occupant , a heavily-chained man dressed only in shiny black leather and white socks , appeared at the window .

german police officers in the western city of aachen thought they had been the victims of a hoax call when they turned up at the home of a man who had called for their assistance . banging on the door of the house for some time without answer , the police were about to leave when the occupant , a heavily-chained man dressed only in shiny black leather and white socks , appeared at the window .
the incapacitated bondage fetishist then managed to drop the keys to the front door out of the window using his teeth .
on entering the building , the police found that the man had been so heavily bound that he was unable to walk .
he then shuffled over to them on his knees with his head bowed in what officers at the scene called the manner of a penguin .
" to visualize the appearance of the afflicted party , one would have to imagine a penguin of waist-height waddling with slightly protruding wings , " aachen police said in a statement .
" we thought it was a joke at first but the chains were bound so tight with handcuffs he could hardly move anything apart from his head . "
after the officers released his handcuffs with their own keys , the man was told that he should use a specialized establishment rather than practice at home .
" we suggested in future that he go to places where that sort of thing might cost a bit more , but would definitely be safer for him , " the spokesperson said .
the police refused to speculate on how the man became ensnared . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .
-lrb- february 18 , 2004 -rrb- feedback if a decision is made to lower and enforce the restrictions on the german autobahn , what , in your opinion , would be a fair speed limit ?

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .
zsa zsa and paris : no-shows as it turned out , mcdowell was the only guest to lend a little u.s.-style glamour to the evening 's proceedings .
following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .
the prince threatened to crash the ball , and bring american socialite and hotel heiress paris hilton -lrb- photo -rrb- as his guest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "
a small number of protesters threw glasses and stones at the hundreds of police in riot gear who were deployed to keep the protesters away from the opera house .
five police officers were injured in the clashes ; seven demonstrators were arrested . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .

" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .

lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .

lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .

not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .

protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.02.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc daimlerchrysler not giving up on truck toll the head of daimlerchrysler , jürgen schrempp , has said he still hopes to resolve the differences of opinion between the german government and the toll collect consortium .
on tuesday , the government cancelled its contract to build a high-tech truck toll system with the companies , which include daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom , and cofiroute , france 's highway tolls operator .
according to the daily newspaper die welt , the consortium has offered to raise its liability for any future delays to the start of the system to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- , if it receives a new contract to continue the project .
an unnamed government spokesperson said that while officials were skeptical that the deal with toll collect could be saved , they were prepared to listen to any new proposals .
schrempp said that a solution would have to be found within the next 10 days .
a deutsche telekom spokesperson declared that the company still believes in toll collect and is working on a solution .
meanwhile , hans-burghart ziermann of toll collect has told german news magazine focus that work is continuing on the system , which could be operational by the end of this year .
talks between the partners broke down earlier this week when toll collect reportedly said it was not prepared to guarantee implementation of the system before 2006 . more briefs 20.02.2004 -pipe- basf to compensate u.s. farmers 20.02.2004 -pipe- germany joins list of poor eu members 19.02.2004 -pipe- toll collect debacle could hurt daimler profit 19.02.2004 -pipe- german travel company buys english airport 18.02.2004 -pipe- volkswagen profit drastically falls in fourth quarter 18.02.2004 -pipe- german producer prices unexpectedly fall 18.02.2004 -pipe- trucking firms seek compensation for failed toll system 17.02.2004 -pipe- israeli court rules in favor of lufthansa radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the minnesota supreme court 's decision upheld a previous ruling by a lower court .
the u.s. subsidiary of basf was accused of deliberately deceiving farmers by selling the same pesticide under different names and for different prices .
the products in question were the pesticides poast and poast plus , which were sold by basf in the u.s. from 1992 to 1996 .
the court ruled that the make-up of both pesticides was more or less identical , and that they had been authorized by the u.s. authorities for the same purposes .
however , basf recommended the more expensive product , poast , for use on sugar cane , sunflowers , potatoes and vegetables .
the court was satisfied that farmers who planted these crops could just have easily used the cheaper product , poast plus .
farmers who 'd bought poast filed a class action suit against basf .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

objections ranged from scepticism to agitation , with some opposing the meeting and others raising questions about its outcome - a proposal to create a vice-president of the commission responsible for the eu ’ s economic management .
speaking in vienna , spanish foreign minster ana palacio expressed concern about the proposal , worried that it would hamper efforts to agree on a constitution .
" spain is open to any proposals " , said the minister , according to efe , but only so long as they bring the eu closer to a deal on the constitution .
last december talks on the text broke down after a row over voting rights for poland and spain .
so far spain has been unbending in its demands to be treated as one of the big boys .
her boss and spain ’ s premier , jose maria aznar , found fault in the meeting itself , warning against erecting " artificial divisions " within the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.02.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc daimlerchrysler not giving up on truck toll the head of daimlerchrysler , jürgen schrempp , has said he still hopes to resolve the differences of opinion between the german government and the toll collect consortium .
on tuesday , the government cancelled its contract to build a high-tech truck toll system with the companies , which include daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom , and cofiroute , france 's highway tolls operator .
according to the daily newspaper die welt , the consortium has offered to raise its liability for any future delays to the start of the system to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- , if it receives a new contract to continue the project .
an unnamed government spokesperson said that while officials were skeptical that the deal with toll collect could be saved , they were prepared to listen to any new proposals .
schrempp said that a solution would have to be found within the next 10 days .
a deutsche telekom spokesperson declared that the company still believes in toll collect and is working on a solution .
meanwhile , hans-burghart ziermann of toll collect has told german news magazine focus that work is continuing on the system , which could be operational by the end of this year .
talks between the partners broke down earlier this week when toll collect reportedly said it was not prepared to guarantee implementation of the system before 2006 . more briefs 20.02.2004 -pipe- basf to compensate u.s. farmers 20.02.2004 -pipe- germany joins list of poor eu members 19.02.2004 -pipe- toll collect debacle could hurt daimler profit 19.02.2004 -pipe- german travel company buys english airport 18.02.2004 -pipe- volkswagen profit drastically falls in fourth quarter 18.02.2004 -pipe- german producer prices unexpectedly fall 18.02.2004 -pipe- trucking firms seek compensation for failed toll system 17.02.2004 -pipe- israeli court rules in favor of lufthansa radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc romanian eu accession could be delayed the need for further reforms could delay the closure of eu talks with the country -lrb- foreseen to end this year -rrb- , and actual membership envisaged for 2007 .
however , the new wording replaces a much tougher draft proposal .
that proposal , drafted last month by the dutch mep arie oostlander and the parliament ’ s rapporteur for romania , emma nicholson , called for the suspension of the negotiations in their current form and a delay until the country is really able to join the eu .
the new report calls on the european commission to " reorient the accession strategy " of romania .
however , nicholson told romanian press that in this particular context , a reorientation or a suspension of the negotiations mean the same thing .
the romanians are putting a positive spin on things , welcoming the new wording and said that the new approach by the european parliament towards romania is constructive .
" every day counts " is the new romanian motto for 2007 eu accession .
but the authorities in bucharest are now being highly criticized for not having halted widespread corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.02.2004 -pipe- 10:00 utc romanian eu accession could be delayed the need for further reforms could delay the closure of eu talks with the country -lrb- foreseen to end this year -rrb- , and actual membership envisaged for 2007 .
however , the new wording replaces a much tougher draft proposal .
that proposal , drafted last month by the dutch mep arie oostlander and the parliament ’ s rapporteur for romania , emma nicholson , called for the suspension of the negotiations in their current form and a delay until the country is really able to join the eu .
the new report calls on the european commission to " reorient the accession strategy " of romania .
however , nicholson told romanian press that in this particular context , a reorientation or a suspension of the negotiations mean the same thing .
the romanians are putting a positive spin on things , welcoming the new wording and said that the new approach by the european parliament towards romania is constructive .
" every day counts " is the new romanian motto for 2007 eu accession .
but the authorities in bucharest are now being highly criticized for not having halted widespread corruption .
nicholson pointed out that the country needs more time , more attention and more money in order to be able to do this and therefore needs a new accession strategy .
the european commission , which recently rebuked bucharest for allowing the continued adoption of romanian children abroad despite a moratorium on the practice , has already expressed its support for the call .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .

lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .

following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .

protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .
zsa zsa and paris : no-shows as it turned out , mcdowell was the only guest to lend a little u.s.-style glamour to the evening 's proceedings .
following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .
the prince threatened to crash the ball , and bring american socialite and hotel heiress paris hilton -lrb- photo -rrb- as his guest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "

lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .
zsa zsa and paris : no-shows as it turned out , mcdowell was the only guest to lend a little u.s.-style glamour to the evening 's proceedings .
following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .
the prince threatened to crash the ball , and bring american socialite and hotel heiress paris hilton -lrb- photo -rrb- as his guest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "
a small number of protesters threw glasses and stones at the hundreds of police in riot gear who were deployed to keep the protesters away from the opera house .
five police officers were injured in the clashes ; seven demonstrators were arrested . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think protesters were right to target vienna 's opera ball ?

german police officers in the western city of aachen thought they had been the victims of a hoax call when they turned up at the home of a man who had called for their assistance . banging on the door of the house for some time without answer , the police were about to leave when the occupant , a heavily-chained man dressed only in shiny black leather and white socks , appeared at the window .

german police officers in the western city of aachen thought they had been the victims of a hoax call when they turned up at the home of a man who had called for their assistance . banging on the door of the house for some time without answer , the police were about to leave when the occupant , a heavily-chained man dressed only in shiny black leather and white socks , appeared at the window .
the incapacitated bondage fetishist then managed to drop the keys to the front door out of the window using his teeth .
on entering the building , the police found that the man had been so heavily bound that he was unable to walk .
he then shuffled over to them on his knees with his head bowed in what officers at the scene called the manner of a penguin .
" to visualize the appearance of the afflicted party , one would have to imagine a penguin of waist-height waddling with slightly protruding wings , " aachen police said in a statement .
" we thought it was a joke at first but the chains were bound so tight with handcuffs he could hardly move anything apart from his head . "

prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son . wolfgang daschner , who has since been moved to an administrative post within the state interior ministry , is being charged with " serious coercion . "
the detective whom he asked to threaten a suspect is facing similar charges , according to prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daschner maintains threats were necessary to locate the boy daschner allegedly ordered officers to threaten the suspected kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , magnus gäfgen , with " intense pain " during questioning in october 2002 .
gäfgen , who had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts , immediately told officers where he had hid jakob 's body and belongings after the threats .
a frankfurt judge sentenced gäfgen , who had kidnapped the boy sept .

" with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " judge hans bachl told the court at the time .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . "
prosecutors immediately launched an investigation into the incident and daschner was temporarily suspended .
deputy chief says threats were crucial to finding boy the 50-year-old police veteran has defended his actions .
he said his threats to employ a martial arts expert to hurt gäfgen were necessary to locate jakob , who police believed was still alive .
gäfgen told them after his confession that he had killed the boy four days before police found the body on oct .

he was backed initially by frankfurt police chief harald weiss-bollandt .
but weiss-bollandt dropped his support as prosecutors began gathering evidence .
international human rights organizations , like amnesty international , as well as the police union , have greeted the decision by frankfurt 's chief prosecutor .

last month , the kloster brewery in the small town of neuzelle on the german-polish border had unveiled the " anti-aging beer " that combined tasty malt with some wellness world favorites , including the wonder algae spirulina and flavonoide , a plant extract used in anti-wrinkle creams .
according to a kloster brewery spokesman , the administrative office ruling said : " the ingredients and the health claims do n't pass the beer purity law . " the beer purity law of 1516 , first created to protect the reputation and quality of the german beer market , is one of the world ’ s oldest food regulations .
the law holds that beverages labelled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .

the minnesota supreme court 's decision upheld a previous ruling by a lower court .
the u.s. subsidiary of basf was accused of deliberately deceiving farmers by selling the same pesticide under different names and for different prices .
the products in question were the pesticides poast and poast plus , which were sold by basf in the u.s. from 1992 to 1996 .
the court ruled that the make-up of both pesticides was more or less identical , and that they had been authorized by the u.s. authorities for the same purposes .
however , basf recommended the more expensive product , poast , for use on sugar cane , sunflowers , potatoes and vegetables .
the court was satisfied that farmers who planted these crops could just have easily used the cheaper product , poast plus .
farmers who 'd bought poast filed a class action suit against basf .
the company maintained throughout the case that the two products were not identical , and has said it intends to appeal the decision . more briefs 20.02.2004 -pipe- germany joins list of poor eu members 19.02.2004 -pipe- toll collect debacle could hurt daimler profit 19.02.2004 -pipe- german travel company buys english airport 18.02.2004 -pipe- volkswagen profit drastically falls in fourth quarter 18.02.2004 -pipe- german producer prices unexpectedly fall 18.02.2004 -pipe- trucking firms seek compensation for failed toll system 17.02.2004 -pipe- israeli court rules in favor of lufthansa 17.02.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler names new mercedes chief radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .

and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .

" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .

kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
“ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil .

" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .
i do n't want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international -lrb- match -rrb- . "
hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
“ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil .
völler to address row on london visit " jens has gone too far , " national coach völler told reporters on thursday .
" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .
i do n't want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international -lrb- match -rrb- . "
hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .
" i would not tolerate it at bayern if the reserve goalkeeper was to speak about kahn that way , " he told a news conference on thursday .

the severity of the row has reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one and captain .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
“ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil .
völler to address row on london visit " jens has gone too far , " national coach völler told reporters on thursday .
" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .
i do n't want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international -lrb- match -rrb- . "
hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .
" i would not tolerate it at bayern if the reserve goalkeeper was to speak about kahn that way , " he told a news conference on thursday .
der kaiser adds his own views bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer adds his weight to the argument .
the severity of the row has reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one and captain .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said beckenbauer " rudi völler has to consider this carefully and act accordingly , " the world cup-winning captain and coach wrote in a column in friday 's mass-circulation bild daily . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last minute goal saves germany embarrassment substitute carsten ramelow snatched victory from the jaws of a mediocre stalemate in croatia on wednesday night as germany won 2-1 in the team 's latest preparation match for the european championships this summer .
-lrb- february 19 , 2004 -rrb- feedback is it time for oliver kahn to step aside ?
comparing the form of their club sides , maybe lehmann has a point .

on tuesday , the government cancelled its contract to build a high-tech truck toll system with the companies , which include daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom , and cofiroute , france 's highway tolls operator .
according to the daily newspaper die welt , the consortium has offered to raise its liability for any future delays to the start of the system to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- , if it receives a new contract to continue the project .
an unnamed government spokesperson said that while officials were skeptical that the deal with toll collect could be saved , they were prepared to listen to any new proposals .
schrempp said that a solution would have to be found within the next 10 days .
a deutsche telekom spokesperson declared that the company still believes in toll collect and is working on a solution .
meanwhile , hans-burghart ziermann of toll collect has told german news magazine focus that work is continuing on the system , which could be operational by the end of this year .

on tuesday , the government cancelled its contract to build a high-tech truck toll system with the companies , which include daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom , and cofiroute , france 's highway tolls operator .
according to the daily newspaper die welt , the consortium has offered to raise its liability for any future delays to the start of the system to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- , if it receives a new contract to continue the project .
an unnamed government spokesperson said that while officials were skeptical that the deal with toll collect could be saved , they were prepared to listen to any new proposals .
schrempp said that a solution would have to be found within the next 10 days .
a deutsche telekom spokesperson declared that the company still believes in toll collect and is working on a solution .
meanwhile , hans-burghart ziermann of toll collect has told german news magazine focus that work is continuing on the system , which could be operational by the end of this year .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .

" we thought it was a joke at first but the chains were bound so tight with handcuffs he could hardly move anything apart from his head . "
after the officers released his handcuffs with their own keys , the man was told that he should use a specialized establishment rather than practice at home .
" we suggested in future that he go to places where that sort of thing might cost a bit more , but would definitely be safer for him , " the spokesperson said .
the police refused to speculate on how the man became ensnared . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .

lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .

following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .

protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son . wolfgang daschner , who has since been moved to an administrative post within the state interior ministry , is being charged with " serious coercion . "
the detective whom he asked to threaten a suspect is facing similar charges , according to prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daschner maintains threats were necessary to locate the boy daschner allegedly ordered officers to threaten the suspected kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , magnus gäfgen , with " intense pain " during questioning in october 2002 .
gäfgen , who had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts , immediately told officers where he had hid jakob 's body and belongings after the threats .
a frankfurt judge sentenced gäfgen , who had kidnapped the boy sept .
27 , 2002 and received € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.26 million -rrb- in ransom money , to 15 years to life in prison on july 29 , 2003 .
torture threats a serious crime reports of the alleged torture threats sparked a debate in germany when they first came out in january 2003 .
torture in any form is illegal in germany and can be punished by up to 10 years in prison .
the judge in the gäfgen case , however , said the torture allegations did not affect his ruling on the convicted murderer 's guilt .
" with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " judge hans bachl told the court at the time .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . "
prosecutors immediately launched an investigation into the incident and daschner was temporarily suspended .
deputy chief says threats were crucial to finding boy the 50-year-old police veteran has defended his actions .
he said his threats to employ a martial arts expert to hurt gäfgen were necessary to locate jakob , who police believed was still alive .
gäfgen told them after his confession that he had killed the boy four days before police found the body on oct .
2 , 2002 .
he was backed initially by frankfurt police chief harald weiss-bollandt .
but weiss-bollandt dropped his support as prosecutors began gathering evidence .
international human rights organizations , like amnesty international , as well as the police union , have greeted the decision by frankfurt 's chief prosecutor .
" we hope that the decision will also make clear that torture , in any case and without restraint , is not allowed and will continue not to be allowed , " said wolfgang genz of amnesty international germany , according to wire reports . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer convicted , police under fire for torture police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .

german police officers in the western city of aachen thought they had been the victims of a hoax call when they turned up at the home of a man who had called for their assistance . banging on the door of the house for some time without answer , the police were about to leave when the occupant , a heavily-chained man dressed only in shiny black leather and white socks , appeared at the window .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .
zsa zsa and paris : no-shows as it turned out , mcdowell was the only guest to lend a little u.s.-style glamour to the evening 's proceedings .
following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .
the prince threatened to crash the ball , and bring american socialite and hotel heiress paris hilton -lrb- photo -rrb- as his guest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .
zsa zsa and paris : no-shows as it turned out , mcdowell was the only guest to lend a little u.s.-style glamour to the evening 's proceedings .
following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .
the prince threatened to crash the ball , and bring american socialite and hotel heiress paris hilton -lrb- photo -rrb- as his guest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "
a small number of protesters threw glasses and stones at the hundreds of police in riot gear who were deployed to keep the protesters away from the opera house .
five police officers were injured in the clashes ; seven demonstrators were arrested . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think protesters were right to target vienna 's opera ball ?

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ m asking for now , ” the 34-year-old former borussia dortmund man added .
personal jibe shows depth of dislike reserve goalkeeper lehmann and kahn , the undisputed number one , have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been hurt by lehmann 's comments .
kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
“ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil .
völler to address row on london visit " jens has gone too far , " national coach völler told reporters on thursday .
" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .
i do n't want to react emotionally to this immediately after an international -lrb- match -rrb- . "
hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .

a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .
it all stems from national reserve keeper jens lehmann 's comments on number one oliver kahn . at a time when the germany soccer team should be showing a united front , the two top goalkeepers in the squad have engaged each other in a war of words .
the instigator , arsenal shot-stopper jens lehmann , is claiming that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern munich 's oliver khan .
what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team has know escalated into a full-blown row that has dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at bayern , ottmar hitzfeld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jens lehmann and national coach rudi völler .
and with the german squad well on the road to preparation for the european championships in portugal this summer , the animosity could well spread further when national team coach rudi völler follows up his comments on the row in person .
the last thing he will want right now , as his team stumbles through its list of friendly games ahead of the tournament , is his two top keepers at each other 's throats on the plane .
i 'm the best , claims lehmann the controversy started after germany scraped through wednesday night 's preparation game with croatia in which a last minute goal by substitute carsten ramelow secured a nervy 2-1 victory .
lehmann , currently atop the english premiership with his london club , gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performance and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team .
" the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted in thursday 's issue of the magazine .
" my performances are more consistent .
over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . "
lehmann watched from the bench in split on wednesday night and saw his rival make a number of unforced errors - one which led to croatia 's equalizer - but also many fine saves .
" of course , it depends on rudi völler , " he said .
" but if you keep performing well , you eventually get rewarded .

" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .

" i was planning to go to england in the next couple of weeks anyway and we will talk about it .

hitzfeld , kahn 's coach at bayern munich , said he felt lehmann deserved to be punished for his comments .

hollywood actress andie mcdowell was the star guest of this year 's vienna opera ball , austria 's most important society event .
guests waltzed the night away despite attempts by protesters to disrupt the extravaganza . it 's still the most glittering , romantic event on vienna 's social calendar .
tickets for the vienna opera ball , the highlight of the austrian capital 's long ball season , sold-out quickly this year , as celebrities from opera , theatre , business and politics vied for the chance to step out in style .
the guests , who paid anywhere from € 215 to € 16,000 for one of the coveted private boxes , arrived at the stately opera house by limousine , or - for those prepared to brave the cold - the more traditional horse and carriage .
over 60,000 roses and tulips decorated the building in hues of deep red and purple for the event , which has taken place each year on the thursday before lent since the mid-19th century . rent-a-star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film star andie macdowell is richard lugner 's guest this year at the vienna opera ball .
the couple at the center of the hype is austria 's wealthy public works magnate richard lugner , and his wife , christina .
each year , they pay a female celebrity to join them as their guest in their private box .
this year 's choice was hollywood film star and model andie mcdowell .
she was the clear favorite with photographers as she arrived at the ball dressed in a black gown , white fur , and a borrowed diamond necklace worth € 1.3 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former baywatch star pamela anderson attended the gala event in 2003 .
lugner described the soft-spoken brunette as " very serious " - a compliment , it seems , as lugner was looking to avoid the sort of media sensation that surrounded last year 's guest , baywatch bombshell pamela anderson -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the buxom blonde created a furore in the austrian press during her visit to the capital .
this year , lugner appealed to journalists to leave mcdowell in peace .
" please do n't write anything about her bosom , or she may decide not to come , " lugner asked the press . "
she has different qualities than pamela anderson . "
mcdowell did n't appear to have any problems with the way she was received in austria , commenting in an interview that she 'd been " treated like a queen " by her hosts .
there was speculation in the press , however , that mcdowell - in contrast to past invitees sophia loren , raquel welch , and joan collins - was a " bargain " for lugner , who only narrowly escaped bankruptcy recently .
he admitted that he counted costs more carefully this year .
" we split the cost of her flight with another sponsor , the make-up artist came from austria instead of from the u.s. , and the weak dollar also helped make the whole thing much cheaper , " lugner said .
zsa zsa and paris : no-shows as it turned out , mcdowell was the only guest to lend a little u.s.-style glamour to the evening 's proceedings .
following a pre-ball war of words , hollywood legend zsa zsa gabor and her ninth husband , prince frederic von westfalen - who is rumored to have bought his title in order to mix with european aristocracy - did not show up .
not that they were invited .
prince frederic lashed out at lugner in an austrian magazine after lugner was reported to have said he was n't aware that gabor , 86 , was still alive .
the prince threatened to crash the ball , and bring american socialite and hotel heiress paris hilton -lrb- photo -rrb- as his guest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince frederic von westfalen threatened to crash the party with paris hilton on his arm .
instead , austria 's top politicians were among the most prominent guests , as well as polish president aleksandar kwasniewski , spanish foreign minister ana palacio , and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer .
protest on the sidelines gossip and glamour aside , the elite event also inspired protest .
around 450 people marched in vienna on thursday , demonstrating not only against the ball , but also u.s. foreign policy and capitalism in general .
they carried banners with slogans such as " down with the opera ball , bring down capitalism , " and " usa : international genocide headquarters . "
a small number of protesters threw glasses and stones at the hundreds of police in riot gear who were deployed to keep the protesters away from the opera house .
five police officers were injured in the clashes ; seven demonstrators were arrested . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .

prosecutors on friday filed charges against frankfurt 's former deputy police chief for ordering threats of violence against the chief suspect in the kidnapping and murder of a prominent banker 's 11-year-old son . wolfgang daschner , who has since been moved to an administrative post within the state interior ministry , is being charged with " serious coercion . "
the detective whom he asked to threaten a suspect is facing similar charges , according to prosecutors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daschner maintains threats were necessary to locate the boy daschner allegedly ordered officers to threaten the suspected kidnapper of 11-year-old jakob von metzler , magnus gäfgen , with " intense pain " during questioning in october 2002 .
gäfgen , who had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts , immediately told officers where he had hid jakob 's body and belongings after the threats .
a frankfurt judge sentenced gäfgen , who had kidnapped the boy sept .
27 , 2002 and received € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.26 million -rrb- in ransom money , to 15 years to life in prison on july 29 , 2003 .
torture threats a serious crime reports of the alleged torture threats sparked a debate in germany when they first came out in january 2003 .
torture in any form is illegal in germany and can be punished by up to 10 years in prison .
the judge in the gäfgen case , however , said the torture allegations did not affect his ruling on the convicted murderer 's guilt .
" with the threat of torture , the police did grave damage to the rule of law of this country , " judge hans bachl told the court at the time .
" their guilt , however , has nothing to do with gäfgen 's guilt . "
prosecutors immediately launched an investigation into the incident and daschner was temporarily suspended .
deputy chief says threats were crucial to finding boy the 50-year-old police veteran has defended his actions .
he said his threats to employ a martial arts expert to hurt gäfgen were necessary to locate jakob , who police believed was still alive .
gäfgen told them after his confession that he had killed the boy four days before police found the body on oct .
2 , 2002 .
he was backed initially by frankfurt police chief harald weiss-bollandt .
but weiss-bollandt dropped his support as prosecutors began gathering evidence .
international human rights organizations , like amnesty international , as well as the police union , have greeted the decision by frankfurt 's chief prosecutor .
" we hope that the decision will also make clear that torture , in any case and without restraint , is not allowed and will continue not to be allowed , " said wolfgang genz of amnesty international germany , according to wire reports . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de killer convicted , police under fire for torture police threatened to torture a law student declared guilty of killing the 11-year-old son of a banker 's family .

rolf fischer has 18 months in jail to think about whether he was driving too fast on the day his actions killed two people .
on the outside , a debate is raging on whether all germans should be forced to cut their speed . the conviction of " turbo " rolf fischer , the 34-year-old mercedes test driver who was found guilty of causing the deaths of a young woman and her two-year-old daughter while traveling at 250km / h -lrb- 155 mph -rrb- on a german motorway on tuesday , has re-opened the debate for stricter controls on the autobahn system . while in the wake of the ground-breaking verdict the german transport ministry announced that it " does not believe a general speed limit makes sense " and that it was more logical to redesign known accident spots , members of the greens party , the government 's coalition junior partner , have begun to resurrect the argument for tighter speed controls on german motorways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the most reasonable solution would be the introduction of a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on german highways , " reinhard loske , the deputy leader of the greens ' parliamentary faction , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
loske 's views were supported by the greens traffic expert albert schmidt : " such a speed limit would be very helpful and would make the traffic more secure and move more fluently . " reinhard weis , the traffic expert for the social democrats in parliament , agreed .
" a speed limit would definitely be an effective tool to increase traffic safety . "
others said a speed limit could have prevented the tragedy .
" with a general speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- , the deadly accident would not have happened , " said rené wassmer , the executive director of the german traffic club , which promotes traffic safety .
he added that germany is still the only land worldwide which has no speed limitation on highways . slowing down saves lives the newspaper report also carried news of an eu investigation which shows that the lowering of the average speed by one kilometre reduces the number of accidents where personal injury occurs by about 2 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two crosses for jasmin a. and her one-year-old daughter rebecca .
according to the german society for the rights of traffic accident victims , more than 646,000 people were killed in traffic accidents between 1947 and 2002 in germany and nearly 24 million were injured .
" the fact that no increases in speed limit have been introduced by the federal transport ministry in that time makes it jointly guilty in all those traffic accidents , " said chairperson angelika oidtmann in an interview with german broadcaster n-tv . the myth of unlimited speeding for many , this discussion of tightening controls on german autobahns will be confusing .
the almost legendary mystique surrounding the german highway is built on the myth that there are no controls to be tightened in the first place .
in fact , the reality is a little different than the legend . far from being the free-for-all that many adrenalin tourists may consider the german road system to be , speed limits are a fact of life on most of germany 's highways , with signs suggesting a recommended speed limit of 130 km / h posted along most autobahns .
urban sections and a few dangerous stretches sometimes have posted speed limits as " low " as 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- .
towns and cities have restrictions of 50 km / h -lrb- 31 mph -rrb- . fundamental right of german drivers however , the option to drive at unrestricted speed on the autobahn remains with the 130 km / h limit set for drivers to observe at their discretion .
in most cases , the right to drive as fast as desired is upheld by many germans as a fundamental part of their personal and federal constitution .
and in a country where the car , not the home , is a person 's castle , many germans have the vehicles to match . herein lies the problem .
with people driving at speeds that suit themselves , the differences in speed can lead to the sort of behavior and result that brought rolf fischer a sentence of 18 months imprisonment . despite this , any restriction on the autobahn speed limit would undoubtedly cause an outrage in germany where these rights that are so stringently upheld by many motorway drivers . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the fast lane to prison a german court has sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for killing a mother and daughter through reckless driving on a motorway .
the accident has triggered a debate on uncontrolled speeding on the autobahns .
-lrb- february 18 , 2004 -rrb- feedback if a decision is made to lower and enforce the restrictions on the german autobahn , what , in your opinion , would be a fair speed limit ?

the " masterplan " for regenerating a 170-acre site of elephant and castle was adopted by the london borough of southwark on thursday evening .
it means it can start looking for developers to create a new town centre .
elephant and castle 's red shopping centre and five 12-storey blocks of flats are to be demolished and the gyratory road system will be re-routed .
the area has good transport links , is close to the city and the west end and is within walking distance of 11 thames river crossings .
plans for elephant removing heygate estate building 4,200 homes re-routing traffic new city academy four new open spaces new retail and leisure space new civic square two new " landmark " buildings but the council feels its development has been stifled by its post-war layout , with its six-lane roundabout , high-rise flats and a shopping centre which has been nominated as london 's ugliest building .
under the scheme there would be 4,200 new and replacement homes , four new open spaces , a new civic square and a market square using " forgotten " victorian railway arches .
the plans went out to a three-month public consultation last year and the council says 80 % of respondents supported the plans .
in a separate survey of the residents of the post-war council blocks on the heygate estate , who are to be re-housed , 61 % of respondents supported the plans , 12 % opposed them and 28 % had no opinion about them .
councillor catherine bowman said : " our plans for a new town centre will give the elephant back its heart and create a place where people will want to travel to , not just through . "
construction is expected to start on some of the new housing sites by the end of 2004 , but the entire project will take about 10 years to complete .

the creatures may have been used as instruments of torture in the notorious " bushtucker trials " on tv 's i 'm a celebrity ... get me out of here , but their image could soon be given a much-needed boost thanks to their new role in modern medicine .
maggots have been used as a way of treating infected wounds for many years , and research has shown that wounds heal quicker than when conventional medicine is used .
but from friday , instead of going to hospital for the treatment , patients will be able to pick up a prescription for maggots , so they can be treated at home .
pioneering research carried out at the princess of wales hospital , in bridgend , south wales has led to the breakthrough .
district nurses will go to patients ' homes and apply them to the wound sealing them into the infection with a dressing , leaving the maggots to feed on the dead tissue .
after three days , the maggots , who leave healthy tissue alone , are removed from the wound and reapplied if necessary .
as many as 20,000 patients in 1,600 centres around the uk have used the treatment so far , and experts believe that many gps will be keen to start prescribing the new procedure to treat a range of infections .
in many cases , the treatment has prevented the need for surgery , or even amputation .
it has also proven effective against antibiotic-resistant strains of micro organisms such as the " super-bug " mrsa .
dr steve thomas , director of the biosurgical research unit at the princess of wales hospital , said : " we recognised there is a greater need for maggot therapy in the community . "
" conventional treatments take so much longer to get the same results " dr steve thomas " from friday , the gps will be able to write a prescription for the maggots .
" the patient then takes it to the pharmacy and we will deliver the maggots to them in special pots and the patient takes them home for the district nurse to apply .
" the maggots clean up the wound and it usually takes about one or two applications lasting three days at a time .
" when they are removed from the wound , they are disposed of as clinical waste .
" conventional treatments take so much longer to get the same results .
" this initiative represents a major advance in the management of all types of chronic or infected wounds such as leg ulcers and diabetic ulcers which together costs the nhs an estimated £ 1bn per annum .
" making this treatment available to patients in their own homes can prevent the need for a protracted hospital stay and reduce the risk of individuals developing a hospital acquired infection , " he added . "
when they suggested maggot therapy to me , all i could think of was that maggots live on dead sheep and i was pretty horrified . "
andrew thomas , former patient andrew thomas ' foot was saved from amputation after using maggots to treat a wound infection .
" i was going to lose my leg if i did n't have the maggots , " said the 43-year-old from llangeinor near bridgend .
" when they suggested maggot therapy to me , all i could think of was that maggots live on dead sheep and i was pretty horrified .
" but it turned that the thought of it having them was actually a lot worse than having them .

but for kent 's domestic violence team , the climb from 9,000 recorded incidents in 1999 to about 14,000 in 2003 represents a real achievement .
pc sue dunn , domestic violence co-ordinator for kent police , said the initial challenge was to fight a massive under-reporting of offences by victims afraid to speak out .
" we know more people feel able to report it so feel we are achieving something there , " she said .
behind closed doors abuse in the home is a problem kent police are determined to beat .
a domestic violence co-ordinator , alison gilmour , has this month been appointed to pull together all the agencies dealing with domestic violence in the county .
she will deal with the police , social services , voluntary groups and the crown prosecution service to make sure victims receive the help they need .
hitting home in kent between january 1999 and december 2002 , 17 people died in kent as a result of domestic violence twelve women were murdered by their current or ex-partners one man was murdered by another member of his family two children were killed by their father kent police record on average 12,000 domestic violence incidents a year more than 100 cases a month are passed to women 's services in kent meanwhile pc dunn is campaigning to bring awareness of domestic violence into the workplace , tackling the perception that it is a problem to be dealt with behind closed doors .
in april , training will be provided for 300 people from 39 public and private sector organisations across the county .
ms dunn said : " it 's making managers and industry understand that domestic violence can affect their staff , whether it 's because of illness , or time off to see a solicitor or doctor . "
she believes the domestic violence , crime and victims bill currently passing through parliament will help the police tackle domestic violence .
" it 's been a long time coming and will give us more powers , which is good news , and also the county and criminal courts as well , " said ms dunn .
a lot of people think it 's a family situation not a police matter but that 's absolutely false and untrue david stevens , domestic violence strategy group for kent former detective superintendent david stevens , who chairs the domestic violence strategy group for kent , said : " domestic violence for the police is incredibly important . "
" a lot of people think it 's a family situation not a police matter but that 's absolutely false and untrue . "
he said officers would now study records of calls to violent incidents in the home when investigating domestic murders .
" the murder will be investigated but there will also be a review of what services the victim of murder had accessed .
mr stevens says to view domestic violence as acceptable is ' ridiculous ' " it will highlight if there are things that could have been done better . "
mr stevens said the vast majority of offenders were male partners but there were also cases of elderly or infirm people being abused by family members , men abused by women or violence in same-sex relationships .
" one of the things we are trying to do is educate people because the notion of domestic violence not being a crime is still prevalent among many people , " he said .
" but if you are trapped in a relationship where you are being beaten every day , with all its ongoing consequences , for us not to view it as a crime is ridiculous . "
part of the desire we have is to make victims understand there are places you can go , people who can help you david stevens he said the police received thousands of referrals each year but were generally the last resort for people seeking help .
each of the nine policing areas in kent has at least one domestic violence officer who can offer support , as can local citizens advice bureaux .
voluntary groups include survivors of abusive relationships -lrb- soar -rrb- in west kent and the freedom project in south-east kent .
mr stevens said : " part of the desire we have is to make victims understand there are places you can go , people who can help you .
" you do n't have to suffer in silence . "

profit at the world 's biggest maker of personal computers jumped 30 % to $ 936m -lrb- £ 494.7m -rrb- in the three months ending january 31 from $ 721m a year earlier .
in the second quarter , sales will rise to $ 19.2bn , the company said , towards the top end of market estimates .
analysts expect the company to benefit from continued consumer spending .
more choice hewlett packard has focused on selling more products such as digital cameras and printers as rivals such as dell slash the price of personal computers to attract buyers .
the company 's printer division now accounts for about 16 % of total sales .

widely taken as an indication of quality , it leads to an additional rush at the multiplexes , extends the run of the movie in question , and brings in pots more cash .
yet with this year 's academy awards almost upon us , the film studios are just a little reluctant to talk about the financial benefits of winning an oscar .
make that completely reluctant .
instead this is perhaps the only time of the year when the studios actually take offence at financial questions .
while they normally like to shout from the rooftops about how many tens of millions their films have grossed , in the weeks before the oscars a complete transformation takes place - the studios are suddenly all pious .
at this time of the year it is certainly not about money they say -lrb- or rather , refuse to comment -rrb- , it is instead about the art , the artistry and the craft .

the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences made the decision in an attempt to lessen the amount of time the larger studios have to spend on big-budget oscar campaigns .
it wanted to give smaller films made by independent companies a better chance to shine .
but why have the main studios - most notably miramax - been accused of spending too much time , effort and money in recent years on promoting their oscar nominations ?

i could n't possibly speculate .

chris hewitt of uk film magazine empire says : " if a film gets two or three of the big oscars - such as best film , best actor and best director - it can go on and really clean up at the box office , " he said .
" one of the main oscars can add between $ 30m and $ 60m to a film 's cinema takings in the us alone . "
dvd sales mr hewitt says this is because it will both persuade people who have n't yet seen the film to go along , and make those who have already been think of going again .
" success at the oscars gives a film a second wind at the box office , " he said .
the genius that is bill murray is favourite to win best actor " take the movie american beauty for example .
critically acclaimed , before the oscars it took $ 70m .
" then it won five oscars in 2000 and went on to take $ 130m , " said mr hewitt .
alexei boltho from bbc films agrees that winning one of the top three oscars - film , actor or actress - can definitely boost a film 's box office takings .
" film distributors such as miramax will often give a film a limited release just before the oscars in order to qualify the film , " said mr boltho .
he added : " if it wins one of the top categories they will then release the film on many , many more prints .
" and for films already in cinemas , winning an oscar can extend both the length of its run and the number of screens on which it is shown , increasing its potential box office take . "
winning an oscar can also increase a film 's future dvd and video sales .
' fade away ' mr hewitt said : " if you 've got people going into a video store to rent a dvd and if they do n't know what they are after , they will be drawn more to a film that says on the front of the box that it has won this or that oscar .
" it adds prestige and is an indication of the film 's quality . "
he added : " and it works for both mainstream commercial films and the more independent ones .

the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences made the decision in an attempt to lessen the amount of time the larger studios have to spend on big-budget oscar campaigns .
it wanted to give smaller films made by independent companies a better chance to shine .
but why have the main studios - most notably miramax - been accused of spending too much time , effort and money in recent years on promoting their oscar nominations ?
' clean up ' is it either because they are so proud of their films , or smell the extra greenbacks ?
i could n't possibly speculate .
lord of the rings is expected to do very well this year exhibit b is the amount of extra revenue it is possible for an oscar-winning film to go on and generate .
chris hewitt of uk film magazine empire says : " if a film gets two or three of the big oscars - such as best film , best actor and best director - it can go on and really clean up at the box office , " he said .
" one of the main oscars can add between $ 30m and $ 60m to a film 's cinema takings in the us alone . "
dvd sales mr hewitt says this is because it will both persuade people who have n't yet seen the film to go along , and make those who have already been think of going again .
" success at the oscars gives a film a second wind at the box office , " he said .
the genius that is bill murray is favourite to win best actor " take the movie american beauty for example .
critically acclaimed , before the oscars it took $ 70m .
" then it won five oscars in 2000 and went on to take $ 130m , " said mr hewitt .
alexei boltho from bbc films agrees that winning one of the top three oscars - film , actor or actress - can definitely boost a film 's box office takings .
" film distributors such as miramax will often give a film a limited release just before the oscars in order to qualify the film , " said mr boltho .
he added : " if it wins one of the top categories they will then release the film on many , many more prints .
" and for films already in cinemas , winning an oscar can extend both the length of its run and the number of screens on which it is shown , increasing its potential box office take . "
winning an oscar can also increase a film 's future dvd and video sales .
' fade away ' mr hewitt said : " if you 've got people going into a video store to rent a dvd and if they do n't know what they are after , they will be drawn more to a film that says on the front of the box that it has won this or that oscar .
" it adds prestige and is an indication of the film 's quality . "
he added : " and it works for both mainstream commercial films and the more independent ones .
" the other side is that films which do n't win , or are n't even nominated for an oscar can just fade away . "

when the clerics took over the state in iran in february 1979 , none of the founders of the islamic republic believed that in less than three decades , the ruling clergy would express concern over the loss of islamic values .
hard line cleric ayatollah ahmad jannati , who chairs the right wing guardian council , which recently barred thousands of reformists from standing for the forthcoming parliamentary election , has described financial corruption in iran as " unprecedented in the whole world " .
this comment stirred widespread controversy in the country 's reformist press .
reformist cleric hadi qabel lives in the holy city of qom , a spiritual centre of shia islam .
his home is close to the seminary at which ayatollah khomeini lectured his zealot pupils .
in the city people make their own vodka at home and once in while , the friday prayers leader has to warn against the spread of crimes including prostitution .
in an article he wrote for bbc persian online on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the " ayatollahs ' revolution " , mr qabel asks the question of " how islamic is the islamic revolution ? "
" the religious government set aside the slogans of equality and freedom of speech a short while after the victory of the islamic revolution and limited political power to a circle of insiders .
during the years before the revolution , university students were fascinated by the islamic ideas of idealist scholars such as ali shariati and mehdi bazargan .
ironically , none of these scholars were clerics .
thanks to the behaviour of the ruling clerics who introduce themselves as the true embodiment of islam , the younger generation of iranians have become seriously disillusioned .
the clerics promised justice and equality but behaved otherwise .
unsuccessful system the islamic republic has defined religious government as a hierarchy which starts from allah on top of everyone and everything .
the there are the prophet and the imams and finally , the supreme leader of the state , currently ayatollah ali khamenei .
the role of the people in such a system is that of sheer obedience .
this system has so far been unsuccessful .
however , iranian youths still believe in religious values , but refuse to take part in the religious rituals which are , to a great extent , state-sponsored .
in a reaction to the ruling clerics ' behaviour , iranian youths show little interest in state-sponsored religious activities but take part in gatherings which have nothing to do with the government .
part of the iranian political establishment tries to pretend that the government is celestial in nature and maintains that it is the people 's duty to pledge allegiance to the government .
religion and state the establishment of an islamic republic meant that the clergy would take over the state .
this created a controversy about the extent the religion would want to intervene in the affairs of the state .
in the early years of the revolution even the intellectuals believed that religion contained directives for every aspect of life .
but after 25 years , it turned out that this was not the case and that man should resort to reason rather than ideology in order to solve his problems .
now they say that religion should stay away from the state and take on , if it really has to , a supervisory role outside the system of government . "

when the clerics took over the state in iran in february 1979 , none of the founders of the islamic republic believed that in less than three decades , the ruling clergy would express concern over the loss of islamic values .
hard line cleric ayatollah ahmad jannati , who chairs the right wing guardian council , which recently barred thousands of reformists from standing for the forthcoming parliamentary election , has described financial corruption in iran as " unprecedented in the whole world " .
in the holy city where khomeini preached questions are being asked about the islamic revolution this comment stirred widespread controversy in the country 's reformist press .
reformist cleric hadi qabel lives in the holy city of qom , a spiritual centre of shia islam .
his home is close to the seminary at which ayatollah khomeini lectured his zealot pupils .
in the city people make their own vodka at home and once in while , the friday prayers leader has to warn against the spread of crimes including prostitution .
in an article he wrote for bbc persian online on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the " ayatollahs ' revolution " , mr qabel asks the question of " how islamic is the islamic revolution ? "
the religious government set aside the slogans of equality and freedom of speech a short while after the victory of the islamic revolution and limited political power to a circle of insiders .
during the years before the revolution , university students were fascinated by the islamic ideas of idealist scholars such as ali shariati and mehdi bazargan .
ironically , none of these scholars were clerics .
thanks to the behaviour of the ruling clerics who introduce themselves as the true embodiment of islam , the younger generation of iranians have become seriously disillusioned .
the clerics promised justice and equality but behaved otherwise .
unsuccessful system the islamic republic has defined religious government as a hierarchy which starts from allah on top of everyone and everything .
the there are the prophet and the imams and finally , the supreme leader of the state , currently ayatollah ali khamenei .
the role of the people in such a system is that of sheer obedience .
this system has so far been unsuccessful .
however , iranian youths still believe in religious values , but refuse to take part in the religious rituals which are , to a great extent , state-sponsored .
in a reaction to the ruling clerics ' behaviour , iranian youths show little interest in state-sponsored religious activities but take part in gatherings which have nothing to do with the government .
part of the iranian political establishment tries to pretend that the government is celestial in nature and maintains that it is the people 's duty to pledge allegiance to the government .
religion and state the establishment of an islamic republic meant that the clergy would take over the state .
this created a controversy about the extent the religion would want to intervene in the affairs of the state .
in the early years of the revolution even the intellectuals believed that religion contained directives for every aspect of life .
but after 25 years , it turned out that this was not the case and that man should resort to reason rather than ideology in order to solve his problems .
now they say that religion should stay away from the state and take on , if it really has to , a supervisory role outside the system of government .

when the clerics took over the state in iran in february 1979 , none of the founders of the islamic republic believed that in less than three decades , the ruling clergy would express concern over the loss of islamic values .
hard line cleric ayatollah ahmad jannati , who chairs the right wing guardian council , which recently barred thousands of reformists from standing for the forthcoming parliamentary election , has described financial corruption in iran as " unprecedented in the whole world " .
in the holy city where khomeini preached questions are being asked about the islamic revolution this comment stirred widespread controversy in the country 's reformist press .
reformist cleric hadi qabel lives in the holy city of qom , a spiritual centre of shia islam .
his home is close to the seminary at which ayatollah khomeini lectured his zealot pupils .
in the city people make their own vodka at home and once in while , the friday prayers leader has to warn against the spread of crimes including prostitution .
in an article he wrote for bbc persian online on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the " ayatollahs ' revolution " , mr qabel asks the question of " how islamic is the islamic revolution ? "
the religious government set aside the slogans of equality and freedom of speech a short while after the victory of the islamic revolution and limited political power to a circle of insiders .
during the years before the revolution , university students were fascinated by the islamic ideas of idealist scholars such as ali shariati and mehdi bazargan .
ironically , none of these scholars were clerics .
thanks to the behaviour of the ruling clerics who introduce themselves as the true embodiment of islam , the younger generation of iranians have become seriously disillusioned .
the clerics promised justice and equality but behaved otherwise .
unsuccessful system the islamic republic has defined religious government as a hierarchy which starts from allah on top of everyone and everything .
the there are the prophet and the imams and finally , the supreme leader of the state , currently ayatollah ali khamenei .
the role of the people in such a system is that of sheer obedience .
this system has so far been unsuccessful .
however , iranian youths still believe in religious values , but refuse to take part in the religious rituals which are , to a great extent , state-sponsored .
in a reaction to the ruling clerics ' behaviour , iranian youths show little interest in state-sponsored religious activities but take part in gatherings which have nothing to do with the government .
part of the iranian political establishment tries to pretend that the government is celestial in nature and maintains that it is the people 's duty to pledge allegiance to the government .
religion and state the establishment of an islamic republic meant that the clergy would take over the state .
this created a controversy about the extent the religion would want to intervene in the affairs of the state .
in the early years of the revolution even the intellectuals believed that religion contained directives for every aspect of life .
but after 25 years , it turned out that this was not the case and that man should resort to reason rather than ideology in order to solve his problems .
now they say that religion should stay away from the state and take on , if it really has to , a supervisory role outside the system of government .

uk coal wants to move 240 selby miners to its site at kellingley , which is a few miles away .
the selby pit complex is set to close in the spring and most workers have been told they will be made redundant .
but talks between managers and the national union of mineworkers -lrb- num -rrb- broke down when the union refused to discuss flexible working arrangements .
' common sense ' existing workers at kellingley are unhappy with proposed changes to their working practices to accommodate the new staff .
managers want to increase the colliery 's operating hours from 95 to 145 a week .
num members reacted by voting for an overtime ban , which starts on wednesday .
uk coal spokesman stuart oliver said : " what we are trying to do is create more jobs for more miners at kellingley colliery .
" what we need to see is some common sense and then we can move these men - all expert miners from selby - to kellingley . "
working terms num spokesman steve kemp said that allowing selby miners to keep their current working conditions after the move would create tension at kellingley .
he told bbc radio york : " the real reason uk coal are doing this is to set miner against miner and there is no need for that at all .
" they know and we know they can transfer the selby miners to kellingley without any changes to terms and conditions -lsb- at kellingley -rsb- . "
mr kemp confirmed that industrial action planned at kellingley will go ahead .
the selby complex , which opened in the 1980s , includes three deep coal mines .
uk coal has decided to close it because of geological problems .

all members were told they could be tested to find out if any of them leaked a secret report into alleged bullying by the deputy chief constable , bill brereton to the media .
the leaked report was discussed in january by the authority which oversees the force .
but two days earlier , a copy was sent anonymously to a freelance journalist .
the force is now trying to find out who was responsible - and they have told authority members they will be included in the investigation , as part of a process of elimination .
bbc wales contacted as many as possible of the 17 authority members to see if they were willing to provide fingerprints and dna samples .
five said they would , and another two said they had no comment to make .
two others said they were opposed - including one who said he would take legal advice over his position if asked to give his fingerprints .
complaints against bill brereton are currently being investigated mold-based freelance journalist elwyn roberts received a copy of the confidential report last month .
the envelope in which it was sent has been seized by police for forensic tests .
as the warning about providing fingerprints or dna samples was made during a meeting of the police authority on thursday , some members said they could be happy to comply but others said they would refuse .
councillor elwyn edwards , a former police officer , said no specific approaches had been made to authority members but said he would take legal advice .
" it 's not very good for the police authority to have that treatment , i ca n't see what good it 's going to do , " he said .
fellow authority member terry renshaw told bbc wales while he was convinced no one on the authority was guilty , he did not think providing samples would be a problem .
speaking about his concerns over the " malicious " leaking of the report , he added : " we 're a team on the authority and we all work together " .
but alyn and deeside labour mp mark tami said the police have to deal with the situation carefully .
" there is a legal issue here , " said mr tami .
" what is being leaked is information and what is being given out is private and it obviously concerns individuals and perhaps personnel records .
" where are we going to end with this search ?
is it going to go to everyone in the police force or perhaps wider ? "
a police spokeswoman declined to comment , saying : " this was a meeting of the police authority and this specific part of the agenda was private .
the press and the public were excluded as is customary when dealing with sensitive matters . "
a senior officer from another force has been appointed to investigate the allegations against mr brereton , who is currently on sick leave .
