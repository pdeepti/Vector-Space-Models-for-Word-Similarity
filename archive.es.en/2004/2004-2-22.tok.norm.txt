the first minister is expected to challenge the " intolerance and prejudice " of anyone opposed to his proposals . "

while winning the argument that scotland needs fresh talent is tough , it would be wrong for us to falter . "
with scotland 's population dwindling , mr mcconnell has made clear in the past that he wants to attract more people from abroad to study and work north of the border .
he has also been in close contact with home secretary david blunkett on the matter .
