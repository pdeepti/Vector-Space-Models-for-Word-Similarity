the estimate was revised upwards from the 3.25 percent figure regularly cited by berlin earlier in the year .
if confirmed , this would make 2004 the third year running that germany , the european union 's largest economy , exceeds the limits set by the stability and growth pact , under which eurozone members may not have public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp .
berlin 's deficit ratio in 2003 was 3.9 percent , or € 82.1 billion -lrb- $ 102.0 billion -rrb- , up from 3.5 percent in 2002 .
the government has pledged to bring its public deficit back below the 3.0 percent ceiling in 2005 . more briefs 27.02.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank reports losses 27.02.2004 -pipe- tax on alcopops planned 27.02.2004 -pipe- porsche recalls cayenne suvs 26.02.2004 -pipe- axel springer doubles profits 26.02.2004 -pipe- major shareholder exonerates manager in mannesmann trial 26.02.2004 -pipe- rwe profit higher than forecast 25.02.2004 -pipe- schröder to urge bush to boost dollar 25.02.2004 -pipe- lufthansa reports big losses in 2003 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

i always look to see if everyone 's doing well , because things should be good for me too .
why should n't things be good for other people as well ?
i think that 's what 's most important .
and ... that i like life .
sepp maier has won just about everything that a soccer player can win .
he played in goal for the german national soccer team 96 times , winning the european championships and the world cup . with his club bayern munich , playing alongside legends like franz beckenbauer , he won the german title four times .
a bad car accident spelled the end of his career on the pitch .
but he returned .
for more than 15 years , he has kept bayern munich and the national team in form with his special training .
his favorite music is the sound of bavarian brass bands .
his favorite book is his own biography .
his favorite food is pichelstein-style stew .
what makes you happy and why ?
what makes me happy is that , at my age , i no longer look in the mirror so often .
i know how old i am , and i 've gotten out of the habit .
no , no , i can look in the mirror .
but more important - i can look myself in the eyes .
what is your secret passion ?
my secret passion is a particular region : the south tyrol .
i love that region .
and i have a second home there .
every chance i get , i go to a village near meran .
who is your personal hero ?
i have always ...
i was always ... well , what 's a hero ?
it 's nothing other than a person .
of course someone who did something , something amazing .
but idolizing someone - i 've never been that way .
i 've never been like that .
what qualities do you most admire in a friend ?
a good friend is simply someone you can talk to about everything .
that 's the most important thing .
it does n't have to be a man , it could also be a woman .
who deserves a big thank you ?
there are several people in my life .
and it starts in sports .
there was my youth trainer , rudolf weiss .
then csik cajkovski at bayern munich , and helmut schön in the national team .
it 's like a mosaic .
to whom do you owe an apology ?
when i think of my book , the most recent book i wrote - there were some passages that i do n't really like .
i was a bit too hard on some people .
i 'd like to apologize to them .
do you have an unfulfilled ambition ?
one of my dreams is to be allowed to play in the pga golf tournament for four days .
it 's not important how i play , i 'd just like to be there .
what do you treasure most ?
when you look forward to every day .
when you go to bed at night and are content .
with me sometimes i go to bed at night and think , man , now i have to go to bed .
there was so much left to do .
it was so nice during the day .
and you want to fall asleep fast because you 're already looking forward to the next day .

what makes you happy and why ?
what makes me happy is that , at my age , i no longer look in the mirror so often .

no , no , i can look in the mirror .
but more important - i can look myself in the eyes .

the legendary german goalkeeper is now passing on the tricks of the trade as a goalkeeping coach . how would you describe your personality ?
i 'm always honest with people , with my fellow men .
i always look to see if everyone 's doing well , because things should be good for me too .
why should n't things be good for other people as well ?
i think that 's what 's most important .
and ... that i like life .
sepp maier has won just about everything that a soccer player can win .
he played in goal for the german national soccer team 96 times , winning the european championships and the world cup . with his club bayern munich , playing alongside legends like franz beckenbauer , he won the german title four times .
a bad car accident spelled the end of his career on the pitch .
but he returned .
for more than 15 years , he has kept bayern munich and the national team in form with his special training .
his favorite music is the sound of bavarian brass bands .
his favorite book is his own biography .
his favorite food is pichelstein-style stew .
what makes you happy and why ?
what makes me happy is that , at my age , i no longer look in the mirror so often .
i know how old i am , and i 've gotten out of the habit .
no , no , i can look in the mirror .
but more important - i can look myself in the eyes .
what is your secret passion ?
my secret passion is a particular region : the south tyrol .
i love that region .
and i have a second home there .
every chance i get , i go to a village near meran .
who is your personal hero ?
i have always ...
i was always ... well , what 's a hero ?
it 's nothing other than a person .
of course someone who did something , something amazing .
but idolizing someone - i 've never been that way .
i 've never been like that .
what qualities do you most admire in a friend ?
a good friend is simply someone you can talk to about everything .
that 's the most important thing .
it does n't have to be a man , it could also be a woman .
who deserves a big thank you ?
there are several people in my life .
and it starts in sports .
there was my youth trainer , rudolf weiss .
then csik cajkovski at bayern munich , and helmut schön in the national team .
it 's like a mosaic .
to whom do you owe an apology ?
when i think of my book , the most recent book i wrote - there were some passages that i do n't really like .
i was a bit too hard on some people .
i 'd like to apologize to them .
do you have an unfulfilled ambition ?
one of my dreams is to be allowed to play in the pga golf tournament for four days .
it 's not important how i play , i 'd just like to be there .
what do you treasure most ?
when you look forward to every day .
when you go to bed at night and are content .
with me sometimes i go to bed at night and think , man , now i have to go to bed .
there was so much left to do .
it was so nice during the day .
and you want to fall asleep fast because you 're already looking forward to the next day .

all activity is centred on the arrival of the 76th academy awards as streets are closed down , pavements are scrubbed and the red carpet already placed in position .
security , always an issue at such high-profile events in the us , is being stepped up hour by hour as the big day approaches .
but far from there being scores of surly , beefy security personnel the men and women guards have a smile for the fascinated tourists despite having to don yellow macs to keep off the intermittent rain .
whether the stars will follow their fashion lead if the rains return on sunday remains to be seen , but the umbrella carriers better get practicing their own walk down the red carpet , to ensure not a drop falls on designer dresses and perfectly coiffed hair .
year-long wait the final touches are being made to the surroundings of the home of the oscars , the kodak theatre , transforming it from shopping mall to award ceremony splendour .
the bleachers have been erected , where 500 lucky fans will be seated to watch the arrivals from the best vantage point .
those taking their seats will have had an extraordinarily long wait , having won their tickets for last year 's ceremony in a lottery , only for the bleachers to be cancelled as the academy scaled back the proceedings as a mark of respect for the war .
they will finally get their chance to take part in the oscars but the anticipation will be even further heightened by the fact they will be shown to their seats at 0600 while the guests do not start arriving until 1500 at the earliest .
five-second delay the stars themselves do not set foot in hollywood until the big day , but the area is already heaving with news crews from around the world , as they experiment with angles and shots trying to second guess what could happen and where on the night .
nearly 1,600 journalists , presenters and technical staff cover the event , just under half the amount of guests the theatre can actually hold on the night .
on average 62m americans watch the live telecast , which this year will have a five-second delay in case of any janet jackson super bowl-type mishaps occur .
as well as providing one of the world 's biggest television events of the year , the academy awards also benefit the local economy .
hollywood 's honorary mayor and local celebrity , johnny grant , predicts the community as a whole profits to the tune of $ 61m when the oscars roadshow is in town , from everybody from limousine drivers to the pizza delivery boys as every hotel in the area is packed out .
grant has enjoyed a varied career in movies , from acting to producing , and at the age of 80 he has lost none of his zeal for hollywood and he does all he can to promote it .
but despite a guaranteed invite he chooses not to attend the awards any more .
" if it was up to me i 'd do away with the ceremony and just have a three-hour red carpet show , " he joked to bbc news online .
in his capacity as an ambassador for hollywood , the larger-than-life grant conducts all the walk of fame ceremonies meeting the stars up close and personal .
but he is not phased by their celebrity status , saying only in the days of ann sheridan and marilyn monroe did he get excited , " as every red-bloodied male would " .
celebratory mood but while grant is blase about the awards , for some it is still a thrilling event .
pop artist burton morris will be attending for the first time , but it will be his work that will be taking centre stage .
the american was commissioned to design the official poster for the 76th academy awards , with his creation adorning every street corner in hollywood .
one covers entire side of a huge building .
the celebrated artist can count the cast of friends among his admirers , as his work regularly features in the show 's central perk cafe .
morris ' wife julie is so proud of her husband that she will be wearing a specially designed dress which incorporates the oscar poster 's motif .
" the reaction to the poster has just been great and hopefully it will be one that people will remember for a long time to come . "
the 2003 awards were dominated by the war in iraq , while the previous year the attention focussed on the 11 september tragedies .
this year the movie industry can once again get back to putting on a full-blown celebration , with the movies and the actors once more at the top of the bill .

he is seen as a new-generation leader with a western outlook and an ability to build contacts with foreign diplomats and politicians .
western governments see him as the man best able to ensure stability in macedonia .
mr trajkovski , who died in a plane crash in bosnia-hercegovina on 26 february 2004 , was born in strumica , macedonia , on 25 june 1956 .
he spoke english and had a law degree from st cyril and methodius university , in skopje .
mr trajkovski , a methodist , also studied theology in the us , where he gave up communism .
he specialised in commercial and employment law , and went on to head the legal department of a construction company .
in 1997 , mr trajkovski became chief-of-office in a skopje local government administration , and in january 1999 he was appointed macedonia 's deputy minister of foreign affairs .
peaceful solution during the kosovo crisis later that year , he accused nato of paying too little attention to the ethnic tensions brewing in macedonia , and the influx of 300,000 ethnic albanian refugees .
trajkovski played a key role in restoring peace in presidential elections that year , he won in the second round , thanks to a last-minute swing of support from ethnic albanians - who make up between a quarter and a third of macedonia 's population of two million .
there had to be a partial re-run two weeks later in the predominantly ethnic albanian region of western macedonia after complaints of alleged irregularities , but mr trajkovski 's victory was confirmed .
in the aftermath of the war in kosovo , as the world feared that the conflict could spread to macedonia , mr trajkovski insisted that only a peaceful solution based on a multi-ethnic democratic state could work .
his more tolerant , inclusive approach played an important part in negotiating an end to the six-month-long conflict between ethnic albanian fighters and macedonian security forces in 2001 .
mr trajkovski helped push through an eu-brokered peace deal that august , under which albanian fighters handed over their weapons to nato in exchange for greater constitutional rights .
despite criticism from nationalists within mr trajkovski 's own party , the relevant changes to the constitution were ratified by parliament and new laws were introduced , paving the way for general elections .
eu pledge mr trajkovski pledged to lead the country towards membership of the eu and nato which , he believed , offer the best hope of lasting stability .
only days before his death he signed macedonia 's formal application to join the eu , which was due to be submitted to the eu 's irish presidency in dublin on thursday .

in 1997 , mr trajkovski became chief-of-office in a skopje local government administration , and in january 1999 he was appointed macedonia 's deputy minister of foreign affairs .
peaceful solution during the kosovo crisis later that year , he accused nato of paying too little attention to the ethnic tensions brewing in macedonia , and the influx of 300,000 ethnic albanian refugees .
trajkovski played a key role in restoring peace in presidential elections that year , he won in the second round , thanks to a last-minute swing of support from ethnic albanians - who make up between a quarter and a third of macedonia 's population of two million .
there had to be a partial re-run two weeks later in the predominantly ethnic albanian region of western macedonia after complaints of alleged irregularities , but mr trajkovski 's victory was confirmed .
in the aftermath of the war in kosovo , as the world feared that the conflict could spread to macedonia , mr trajkovski insisted that only a peaceful solution based on a multi-ethnic democratic state could work .
his more tolerant , inclusive approach played an important part in negotiating an end to the six-month-long conflict between ethnic albanian fighters and macedonian security forces in 2001 .
mr trajkovski helped push through an eu-brokered peace deal that august , under which albanian fighters handed over their weapons to nato in exchange for greater constitutional rights .
despite criticism from nationalists within mr trajkovski 's own party , the relevant changes to the constitution were ratified by parliament and new laws were introduced , paving the way for general elections .
eu pledge mr trajkovski pledged to lead the country towards membership of the eu and nato which , he believed , offer the best hope of lasting stability .
only days before his death he signed macedonia 's formal application to join the eu , which was due to be submitted to the eu 's irish presidency in dublin on thursday .

writing in the guardian , prince charles says 12 million people in britain suffer from allergies at any one time .
the prince has long been a supporter of complementary therapies such as acupuncture and herbal medicine .
but , he writes , " 90 % of complementary medicine is currently only available to those who can afford to pay for it " .
allergy is about lifestyle - what we eat and touch , and what we breathe prince charles the prince says the increased comfort and cleanliness of " the western way of life " is responsible for high numbers of allergies .
" we spend up to 80 % of our time indoors , and the sealing of our houses to conserve heat and energy , the increase in soft furnishings ... increase the chance of those genetically at risk becoming sensitised to domestic allergens , " he says .
he says he wrote the comment piece in the guardian in repsonse to an article in the same newspaper predicting that half of all europeans would suffer an allergy by 2015 .
" clearly , something dramatic is happening , " he writes .
" the rising trends in allergy seen in developing countries , as they adopt our western habits , point strongly to factors in the way we live . "
' not expensive ' charles says more complementary medicine should be available to everyone on the nhs .
complementary therapies emphasise preventative care , and encourage people to take responsibility for their own treatment , he adds .
" it seems extraordinary to me that despite a recent poll indicating that 75 % of people want complementary medicine available to all on the nhs , that very few such clinics exist , " he writes correcting this imbalance " need not mean huge additional expenditure " , he adds .
a department of health spokeswoman said the nhs did offer a range of complementary medicines and therapies .
" this is part of modernising nhs services , however it is up to doctors to decide what is the best care and treatment for their patients , " she said .

he says he wrote the comment piece in the guardian in repsonse to an article in the same newspaper predicting that half of all europeans would suffer an allergy by 2015 .
" clearly , something dramatic is happening , " he writes .
" the rising trends in allergy seen in developing countries , as they adopt our western habits , point strongly to factors in the way we live . "
' not expensive ' charles says more complementary medicine should be available to everyone on the nhs .
complementary therapies emphasise preventative care , and encourage people to take responsibility for their own treatment , he adds .
" it seems extraordinary to me that despite a recent poll indicating that 75 % of people want complementary medicine available to all on the nhs , that very few such clinics exist , " he writes correcting this imbalance " need not mean huge additional expenditure " , he adds .
a department of health spokeswoman said the nhs did offer a range of complementary medicines and therapies .

he has asked them to consider the impact of the proposals on vulnerable people seeking refuge in the uk .
mps opposed to the bill say it reduces appeal rights and puts the process beyond the scrutiny of the courts .
the cardinal argued that it falls short of standards outlined in the european convention on human rights .
the bill , which aims to streamline the asylum appeal procedures , is being debated in the commons next week .
the vote on the bill is an opportunity to demonstrate whether scotland is a welcoming country or not .
cardinal keith o 'brien cardinal o 'brien has written to all scottish mps in advance of the vote .
his letter said : " a couple of weeks before his death in 2001 the late cardinal winning asked whether scotland was making strangers welcome .
" he was concerned about politicians being tempted to outdo each other in recommending ever more draconian methods to deal with some of the most hurt and vulnerable people in our country .
" i fear that the latest proposals for asylum seekers , including taking children into care , demonstrate that cardinal winning 's worry about politicians was well placed .
" i ask you as one of scotland 's mps to consider whether your vote on the asylum and immigration bill on monday 1 march will demonstrate that the stranger is welcome in our midst .
' victims of injustice ' " as statistics show , asylum seekers who come to this country are normally victims of injustice in their own country and they should be protected in our midst whilst their claims are examined . "
cardinal o 'brien said asylum seekers should be protected to the standards outlined in un refugee convention , the universal declaration of human rights and the european convention on human rights .
but he said the new bill falls short of these standards in some areas .
he said : " the vote on the bill is an opportunity to demonstrate whether scotland is a welcoming country or not . "
concerns about the proposed legislation have also been raised from the catholic church 's justice and peace commission .
they say the bill could result in children being removed from families and placed in care .

he has asked them to consider the impact of the proposals on vulnerable people seeking refuge in the uk .
mps opposed to the bill say it reduces appeal rights and puts the process beyond the scrutiny of the courts .
the cardinal argued that it falls short of standards outlined in the european convention on human rights .
the bill , which aims to streamline the asylum appeal procedures , is being debated in the commons next week .
the vote on the bill is an opportunity to demonstrate whether scotland is a welcoming country or not .
cardinal keith o 'brien cardinal o 'brien has written to all scottish mps in advance of the vote .
his letter said : " a couple of weeks before his death in 2001 the late cardinal winning asked whether scotland was making strangers welcome .
" he was concerned about politicians being tempted to outdo each other in recommending ever more draconian methods to deal with some of the most hurt and vulnerable people in our country .
" i fear that the latest proposals for asylum seekers , including taking children into care , demonstrate that cardinal winning 's worry about politicians was well placed .
" i ask you as one of scotland 's mps to consider whether your vote on the asylum and immigration bill on monday 1 march will demonstrate that the stranger is welcome in our midst .
' victims of injustice ' " as statistics show , asylum seekers who come to this country are normally victims of injustice in their own country and they should be protected in our midst whilst their claims are examined . "
cardinal o 'brien said asylum seekers should be protected to the standards outlined in un refugee convention , the universal declaration of human rights and the european convention on human rights .
but he said the new bill falls short of these standards in some areas .
he said : " the vote on the bill is an opportunity to demonstrate whether scotland is a welcoming country or not . "

the doctors ' watchdog is accused of lacking objectivity and failing to protect patients , in the lawyer 's letter leaked to health journal pulse .
the shipman inquiry 's findings into how the gp was able to murder at least 215 patients are not due till this summer .
the gmc attacked the leak and said it had already introduced major reforms .
in the document , the gmc is criticised over its investigations , administration , attitude , policies and practices .
i do n't think today the gmc in any sense deserves to be labelled as ' doctors looking after doctors ' finlay scott general medical council written by solicitor henry palin to the gmc , the letter accuses the council of being self-serving , biased in favour of doctors , failing to protect patients , overly secretive and acting through " expediency rather than principle " .
the gmc said it was " another matter " whether the points would be raised in the inquiry 's final findings and attacked the magazine for attempting " to interfere with the processes of the shipman inquiry " .
' failures ' a spokeswoman said the council was implementing a massive reform programme .
chief executive finlay scott said the council was about " professionally-led regulation in partnership with the public " .
he added that 14 of the 35 members of the council 's governing body were lay people .
" i do n't think today the gmc in any sense deserves to be labelled as ' doctors looking after doctors ' , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
he said the council 's response would be published on the inquiry 's website soon .
the letter was sent to the council in late december last year to give the council a chance to respond before inquiry chair dame janet smith began drafting her final report .
' prejudices ' it blames the gmc for its " failure to lay down clear policies so as to properly reflect its claimed objective of protecting patients " .
the inquiry argues that gmc decision makers may be said to " lack objectivity " and that their " prejudices favoured the doctor rather than the complainant " .
shipman hanged himself in his cell last month after being convicted in january 2000 of murdering 15 patients .
the inquiry has found he murdered at least 215 .
a gmc spokeswoman said : " we deplore the attempt to interfere with the processes of the shipman inquiry that the leaking of this letter from the inquiry to the gmc represents . "

the so called " third wave " of red letters has begun and they warn of a strong possibility of a shortfall when the policy matures .
however the letters do not mention that customers can complain and may only have a short time left to do so .
these red letters are crucial for some policy-holders as they will only have six months left in which to pursue a case for compensation through the financial ombudsman service .
one of the first to send its letters to its policy-holders is friends provident .
but more are expected soon .
sense of urgency independent financial adviser mark meldon at rc gray & co told bbc radio 4 's money box programme the letters are confusing , and many customers will not act .
if it is a red letter , there is a high risk the policy will not pay out , and that starts a very important clock ticking louise hanson , consumers association he continued : " one could argue that the financial services authority and the life industry really want to get this over and done with this year ...
by september , october time there will be no more people able to complain about endowment mis-sales . "
commenting on the letters , louise hanson , head of campaigns at the consumers association said : " by calling them a yearly statement , it does not bring a sense of urgency , or really accurately reflect , that if it is a red letter , there is a high risk the policy will not pay out and that starts a very important clock ticking . "
appropriate action but alan leaman , head of public affairs at the association of british insurers -lrb- abi -rrb- denied that his members are trying to mislead their customers .
i think what we would be pleased about is if people took appropriate action if they were facing a shortfall alan leaman , abi " the wordings of -lsb- the letters -rsb- were poured over in great detail with the fsa and they are accompanied by an fsa leaflet entitled ' your endowment , have you acted yet ? ' , with a very clear description of - if you want to complain - how to go about it . "
mr leaman told the programme the letters are meant to get a response : " i think what we would be pleased about is if people took appropriate action if they were facing a shortfall . "
but louise hanson says letters should be properly colour-coded and include information on what mis-selling is and how to complain in the body of the letter itself .
meanwhile policy-holders receiving letters are advised to look out for the phrase " there is a " high risk " the policy will not pay out " .
concerned policy-holders can also call their insurers to find out more .

the anti-social behaviour bill aims to force parents to take responsibility for their offspring and extend electronic tagging to under-16s .
it would also give police new powers to disperse groups .
ms curran rejected criticism of the legislation and told the conference some local communities refused the offer of play parks or open spaces because these would become the focus of disorder .
she said : " we have to confront the reality of millions of pounds of wasted investment into houses and streets where no-one wants to live because of a local environment blighted by anti-social behaviour .

all other parties have - but we will not hide from the realities .
" labour is determined to ensure the focus of our parliament is on the real experiences of real people .
" if the middle class journalists sitting in the wine-bars find this boring , too bad . "
activist helena brackenridge told the conference that young people themselves were the victims of anti-social behaviour .
" we are sending a clear signal that those who disrespect their communities , young or old , will no longer have the upper hand , " she said .
johann lamont , msp for glasgow pollok , told delegates that anti-social behaviour undermined efforts to improve other services like transport .
she said : " you will never secure social inclusion if you have families frightened in their homes , embarrassed to bring friends back , and whose only desire is to get out of the communities they have created - and when they seek help , the great and the good sneer . "
