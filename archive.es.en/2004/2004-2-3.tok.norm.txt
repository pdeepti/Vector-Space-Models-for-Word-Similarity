convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

" i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .

ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .

while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !
in a bid to promote itself as a fun-loving , humorous nation , germany is targetting british schools with a new campaign designed to counter the negative images surrounding the country and its history .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !
in a bid to promote itself as a fun-loving , humorous nation , germany is targetting british schools with a new campaign designed to counter the negative images surrounding the country and its history .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .

brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .

he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

a british production company was said to be among those interested .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.02.2004 ryanair loses to eu in subsidies battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair could be grounded at charleroi .
low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .

ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .

according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .

the shortfall will probably rise to € 10 billion -lrb- $ 12.6 billion -rrb- from the previous record of € 9.7 billion in 2003 as spending on social welfare increases 4.6 percent after a 7.7 percent rise last year , according to bloomberg .
mayors are being forced to cut back on city services and close facilities as deficits widen amid slow growth and persistent unemployment .
petra roth , the mayor of frankfurt and dstgb president , urged chancellor gerhard schröder and state leaders to keep their promise to shoulder € 2.5 billion in costs for social welfare recipients .
" the diagnosis is well known but the federal government and the states keep postponing the therapy , " said roth .
she added that many german cities have “ their backs to the wall . ” more briefs 02.02.2004 -pipe- linde to expand hungarian operations 02.02.2004 -pipe- law to enforce traineeships ready by march 02.02.2004 -pipe- condomi gains from takeover speculation 30.01.2004 -pipe- german retail figures still down 30.01.2004 -pipe- government to put deutsche bahn on a budget 30.01.2004 -pipe- europeans take to the skies 30.01.2004 -pipe- germans stockpile medicines 29.01.2004 -pipe- core grundig unit sold radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .

prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .

" i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .

according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !
in a bid to promote itself as a fun-loving , humorous nation , germany is targetting british schools with a new campaign designed to counter the negative images surrounding the country and its history .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

after nine weeks in a clinic being treated for depression , german soccer star sebastian deisler surprised his bayern munich teammates by returning to training on monday ahead of schedule . nothing could be better news for a soccer team preparing to meet the likes of ronaldo , zidane , figo and beckham than the return of one of its star players . back from a debilitating bout of depression , bayern munich star midfielder sebastian deisler brought a smile to the face of coach ottmar hitzfeld when he surprisingly turned up for work at the sabener strasse training complex on monday morning . with bayern preparing to defend its german champions title defense and pursuing the european champions league trophy , the team could definitely use deisler 's skills on the pitch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler 's treatment appears to have been successful .
deisler returned to training ahead of schedule after being discharged from the max-planck institute for psychiatry last week after nine weeks of treatment for depression .
the 24-year-old german international told reporters , “ i have the desire for soccer 100 percent again , it never actually went .
it 's been a long time .
i missed the game . ” “ i am still carrying a bit of extra weight and it will take me a few weeks to get fit again , but i am happy to be back . ” madrid clash on the horizon the coaching team at bayern was also happy to have the midfield player back in the ranks of bayern ’ s star-studded team , especially as the knock-out stages of the champions league begin this month with the german champions facing the mighty real madrid .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .

after nine weeks in a clinic being treated for depression , german soccer star sebastian deisler surprised his bayern munich teammates by returning to training on monday ahead of schedule . nothing could be better news for a soccer team preparing to meet the likes of ronaldo , zidane , figo and beckham than the return of one of its star players . back from a debilitating bout of depression , bayern munich star midfielder sebastian deisler brought a smile to the face of coach ottmar hitzfeld when he surprisingly turned up for work at the sabener strasse training complex on monday morning . with bayern preparing to defend its german champions title defense and pursuing the european champions league trophy , the team could definitely use deisler 's skills on the pitch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler 's treatment appears to have been successful .
deisler returned to training ahead of schedule after being discharged from the max-planck institute for psychiatry last week after nine weeks of treatment for depression .
the 24-year-old german international told reporters , “ i have the desire for soccer 100 percent again , it never actually went .
it 's been a long time .
i missed the game . ” “ i am still carrying a bit of extra weight and it will take me a few weeks to get fit again , but i am happy to be back . ” madrid clash on the horizon the coaching team at bayern was also happy to have the midfield player back in the ranks of bayern ’ s star-studded team , especially as the knock-out stages of the champions league begin this month with the german champions facing the mighty real madrid .
it is not clear , however , when deisler will feature in his first competitive game since his illness .
" maybe his return will be just as surprising as here today , " said coach hitzfeld as deisler was put through light training by fitness trainer bjorn andersen before joining the rest of the squad for a workout on monday .
“ there will be no pressure .
it 's very important that he 's back in his normal daily routine .

we 've had a son , which is a beautiful thing , and it 's just enjoyable again .
it 's my motivation and i 'm simply happy . ”
the 24-year-old has had to overcome five knee operations and other frequent injuries in his short career which has been mostly conducted under an intense media glare .
frequently hailed as the future of german soccer and talked about as one of the most talented players in a generation , the pressure on deisler after his € 9.2 million -lrb- $ 11.5 million -rrb- move from hertha berlin to the champions seemed to have been taken in his stride . he delivered some highly praised performances earlier this season , only to stun the club and fans by checking into the munich clinic in november . a german international with 20 caps , deisler ’ s return will also be welcomed by national team coach rudi völler , who is hoping to have the bayern playmaker ready for the european championships in portugal this summer . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern 's deisler leaves nerve clinic sebastian deisler , the young bayern munich playmaker who at one time carried the hopes of many german soccer fans , has checked out of the clinic where he was being treated for depression .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .

charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.02.2004 brooks ’ musical faces german inquisition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the producers " contains some scenes that germans may find offensive .
convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !
in a bid to promote itself as a fun-loving , humorous nation , germany is targetting british schools with a new campaign designed to counter the negative images surrounding the country and its history .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .

brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "

after nine weeks in a clinic being treated for depression , german soccer star sebastian deisler surprised his bayern munich teammates by returning to training on monday ahead of schedule . nothing could be better news for a soccer team preparing to meet the likes of ronaldo , zidane , figo and beckham than the return of one of its star players . back from a debilitating bout of depression , bayern munich star midfielder sebastian deisler brought a smile to the face of coach ottmar hitzfeld when he surprisingly turned up for work at the sabener strasse training complex on monday morning . with bayern preparing to defend its german champions title defense and pursuing the european champions league trophy , the team could definitely use deisler 's skills on the pitch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler 's treatment appears to have been successful .
deisler returned to training ahead of schedule after being discharged from the max-planck institute for psychiatry last week after nine weeks of treatment for depression .
the 24-year-old german international told reporters , “ i have the desire for soccer 100 percent again , it never actually went .
it 's been a long time .
i missed the game . ” “ i am still carrying a bit of extra weight and it will take me a few weeks to get fit again , but i am happy to be back . ” madrid clash on the horizon the coaching team at bayern was also happy to have the midfield player back in the ranks of bayern ’ s star-studded team , especially as the knock-out stages of the champions league begin this month with the german champions facing the mighty real madrid .
it is not clear , however , when deisler will feature in his first competitive game since his illness .
" maybe his return will be just as surprising as here today , " said coach hitzfeld as deisler was put through light training by fitness trainer bjorn andersen before joining the rest of the squad for a workout on monday .
“ there will be no pressure .
it 's very important that he 's back in his normal daily routine .
we are going to take it slowly . "
new father embraces life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler himself was remarkably upbeat and positive about his return and his life after treatment , especially after becoming a father for the first time last week .
“ i feel very good .
the most important thing was the pleasure in being back on the pitch .
we 've had a son , which is a beautiful thing , and it 's just enjoyable again .
it 's my motivation and i 'm simply happy . ”
the 24-year-old has had to overcome five knee operations and other frequent injuries in his short career which has been mostly conducted under an intense media glare .
frequently hailed as the future of german soccer and talked about as one of the most talented players in a generation , the pressure on deisler after his € 9.2 million -lrb- $ 11.5 million -rrb- move from hertha berlin to the champions seemed to have been taken in his stride . he delivered some highly praised performances earlier this season , only to stun the club and fans by checking into the munich clinic in november . a german international with 20 caps , deisler ’ s return will also be welcomed by national team coach rudi völler , who is hoping to have the bayern playmaker ready for the european championships in portugal this summer . dw staff -lrb- na -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern 's deisler leaves nerve clinic sebastian deisler , the young bayern munich playmaker who at one time carried the hopes of many german soccer fans , has checked out of the clinic where he was being treated for depression .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "

prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .
aggressive defense the ruling could mark the start of a longer , bloodier battle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael o 'leary , chief executive of ryanair .
ryanair chief o 'leary -lrb- photo -rrb- has gone on the offensive , announcing before the ruling that were brussels to decide against the low-cost carrier , he would pull out of charleroi and launch potentially costly legal action against rival carriers and other regional airports .
the carrier said forcing repayment at charleroi could force airlines and airports to make similar repayments since agreements such as the one ryanair has in belgium are common in almost all eu countries .
" this means , effectively regional airports , that are publicly owned ... now will no longer be allowed to offer discounts to airlines in return for low fare air travel , " o 'leary said on a bbc television program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ryanair international airplane he said a negative outcome for his company could force other no-frills carriers to raise the prices , putting the whole future of low-cost air travel in question .
according to him , it could also seriously impact the economies in those regions around once-sleepy airports that have benefitted from the budget air travel boom .
charleroi on the front lines when ryanair first arrived in charleroi in 1997 , it turned the obscure , little-used airport into its european hub .
the airline added 700 jobs on site and another 2,600 were created indirectly .
estimates are that some 10 million will pass through the airport in the next five years .
while ryanair 's arrival did not solve all of charleroi 's woes , it did give hope to the town of 400,000 , whose residents often left it for flanders or brussels to find work .
" if ryanair left it would be catastrophic .
it would be just too difficult to find work , " mohamed belhejdoub , who manages the currency exchange desk at the airport , told reuters .
eu not against low-cost carriers the european commission insists it is in favor of no-frills airlines , and points to its efforts towards promoting deregulation and ending state aid to national carriers that help fuel the meteoric rise of ryanair and its ilk .
it says it is taking actions in this case to ensure that everyone plays by the same rules .
the regulations ban subsidies unless they are on a purely commercial , such as those offered by a private airport operator .
second blow the ruling comes on the heels of a court judgment against ryanair ordering it to provide free wheelchairs to those who need them .
the case centered on a 54-year-old passenger with cerebral palsy who sued the carrier after he was charged € 26 -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- to use a wheelchair at stanstead airport .
the plaintiff , london resident bob ross , won the case and the court ordered ryanair to reimburse him for the wheelchair charge and to pay damages .
ryanair 's o 'leary said the company would appeal the ruling , adding that he thought the 50 pence -lrb- 70 cent -rrb- surcharge that has now been added to every ticket to cover the costs of wheelchairs would be short lived . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the brakes on budget airlines ?

the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .

britain will hold an inquiry to investigate the intelligence used to build the case for war in iraq .
a similar inquiry will be held in the u.s. after the failure to find iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . the british government has confirmed plans to hold an independent inquiry into the intelligence which formed the basis of the u.k. 's decision to go to war in iraq .
prime minister tony blair made the announcement on tuesday while being questioned on the government 's iraq intelligence by a parliamentary committee . " i think it is right … that we have a look at the intelligence that we received and whether it was accurate or not , " he said . british foreign secretary jack straw later told parliament that the inquiry - which will hear from witnesses in private - is expected to report its conclusions by the summer . but the nature and scope of the inquiry - to be headed by former chief civil servant lord butler - has already caused dissent , with the opposition liberal democrats refusing to take part .
they said the investigation should also include the political decisions taken in the run-up to the war , instead of focusing solely on the problems with the accuracy of intelligence from iraq . blair 's u-turn the british government had previously rejected calls for an inquiry .
however , the results of a separate inquiry by senior judge lord hutton into the events surrounding the death of british weapons expert dr. david kelly have now cleared the government of accusations that it " sexed up " its intelligence dossier on iraq .
blair 's spokesman said that lord hutton 's conclusions allow for a rational discussion of what the government did or did n't know about iraq 's weapons program . the british decision follows the announcement of a similar inquiry in the united states .
on monday , u.s. president george w. bush said that he would name an independent , bipartisan committee to look into faulty intelligence in iraq , as well as intelligence gaps in other countries , including iran and north korea .
a timetable for the investigation has not yet been set . pressure has mounted on both governments to set up inquiries after former chief u.s. arms inspector david kay resigned last month , telling u.s. congress there was a possibility that iraq did not possess any stockpiles of chemical , biological or nuclear weapons . " this is one of the reasons why i think we need a further inquiry , " blair told the parliamentary committee . unwavering conviction the threat posed by iraq 's alleged weapons of mass destruction was the main argument set out by both the u.s. and british governments in the run-up to the war in iraq .
but months after the war 's end , with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in sight , both governments have begun to emphasize the evil nature of saddam hussein 's dictatorial regime as a prime justification for his removal . blair 's critics say the failure to find weapons of mass destruction has dealt a huge blow to his credibility .
but blair has not wavered in his conviction that going to war was the appropriate course of action . " had we failed to act on the intelligence we received , i think it would have been a gross dereliction of duty , " he said on tuesday , adding : " i do n't think we 've got anything whatsoever to hide .

low-cost carrier ryanair will have to repay millions in illegal subsidies , the european union has ruled .
the irish airline has threatened to unleash a flood of litigation against rivals . in the eyes of timothy o 'leary , the outspoken head of the no-frills carrier ryanair , it is a classic case of eu bureaucracy hurting the economy of europe for no good reason .
the eu sees the case differently , saying ryanair has to the follow the rules just like everyone else .
the eu will require ryanair to pay back belgian subsidies granted to to encourage the airline to maintain a hub at charleroi airport , south of brussels .
the amount that ryanair will have to repay is being debated by the full 20-member european commission .
according to reuters , it is estimated that the eu will ask ryanair to repay between two and seven million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 - $ 8.7 million -rrb- , about a quarter of the total subsidies the carrier received .
the eu decided that subsidies ryanair received from charleroi airport in the form of lower landing fees , ground handling charges and marketing costs were illegal .
however , it took a softer stance on cost breaks ryanair received to help its marketing and open an office at the airport .

convincing the germans that a singing hitler and dancing nazis is entertainment is the current task facing u.s. comedian mel brooks , who hopes to take his musical “ the producers ” to germany . u.s. comedian and director mel brooks has never been one to shy away from potential controversy in his pursuit of irreverent humor .
however , the man who rewrote the history of the world to include a musical version of the spanish inquisition and made small town racism in the american wild west laugh-out-loud funny is now preparing to take on his toughest audience with material that strikes at its very marrow .
brooks wants to get the germans to laugh at hitler .
a german theatre company is interested in hosting brooks ’ successful broadway musical “ the producers , ” a story of two new york con men who deliberately open the most distasteful musical ever in a bid to swindle investors , which contains a show-stopping second act entitled “ springtime for hitler ” complete with a chorus line of goose-stepping nazis .
german delegation invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel brooks and friends .
brooks -lrb- picture , center -rrb- has invited a " representative sample of germans " - or as the 77-year-old brooklyn-born jewish comedian put it unrepentantly , " twenty-five krauts with their helmets on " - to vet the production at the st. james theater on broadway , which is once again starring the original leading men nathan lane and matthew broderick in the roles of max bialystock and leo bloom .
" -lrb- the delegation -rrb- will decide whether or not this is just too unspeakably rude for the germans , " said brooks at a press conference on monday to announce the transfer of the broadway show to london ’ s west end .
" we ’ ll see if it works out - if they are upset , or if they are young enough to roll with the punches and make fun of the nazi regime .
if they like it , and say ' this will go down nicely ' , then we 'll do it . "
older people may have a problem with content brooks conceded that there may be some who could cause problems with plans to stage the musical in germany .
“ anyone over 60 may have an ax to grind . ”
“ it 's not a matter of taste , ” he added .
“ it 's a matter of the show closing if they do n't like it - or of me being shot in the head by a sniper 's rifle . ”
but ultimately , he said , the idea was only to provide a night of entertainment .
" we want to get people laughing ; we do n't want to offend anybody . "
" rhetoric does not get you anywhere , because hitler and mussolini are just as good at rhetoric .
but if you can bring these people down with comedy , they stand no chance . "
making hitler a figure of fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler 's power is being challenged by brooks ' humor .
co-writer tom meehan said , " mel is a little man from brooklyn who has no power except to ridicule .
he takes on hitler , and makes him a figure of fun .
there is something charmed about mel .
if anybody else did that , they would get themselves killed . "
the tony award-winning director developed the musical from the original screenplay of his 1968 film of the same name which starred zero mostel and gene wilder .
brooks launched the stage version in 2001 .
he said that he had taken heart from the apparent success of the movie in germany .
" germans seem to like the film , but they 're young .
they 're kids , they 're smart , " he said .
the west end production of the show is set to open in november and will star british actor and comedian lee evans and american actor richard dreyfuss . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more fun please , we ’ re german !

the two companies have cooperated on a series of programmes , but there are no plans for closer ties , said boeing chief executive harry stonecipher .
he said bae had a range of activities the us firm was not interested in , such as ship and submarine building .
his comments contrast with the apparent enthusiasm for a merger from his predecessor , phil condit .
bae systems uk 's biggest defence contractor looking for us merger partner owner of 20 % stake in plane maker airbus mr stonecipher , in london for his first visit since his appointment as new boeing boss , said he would be meeting bae chairman sir richard evans but purely for social reasons .
last week , boeing and bae were turned down by the uk government over a joint bid for a huge contract to provide the royal air force with refuelling aircraft , preferring the pan-european eads group .
there has been persistent speculation about a us tie-up for the uk 's biggest defence firm .
some investors have argued that finding a us merger partner is crucial if bae is significantly to expand its business in the valuable us market .
in october us firm general dynamics walked away from exploratory merger talks with bae .

according to the student loans company , 899 filed for bankruptcy last year , compared with 276 in 2002 , 249 in 2001 , 97 in 1998 and eight in 1992 .
a number are thought to have taken advantage of a loophole in government legislation allowing student loan debts to be cancelled out by bankruptcy .
the government is to close the loophole as part of the higher education bill .
cancelled out last week the bill was passed by a narrow majority of 316 votes to 311 , after 72 labour mps voted against plans for university top-up fees .
some rebel mps have vowed to fight on as the bill goes through its next stage in parliament .
mps are now likely to spend two to three months going through the bill line by line in its committee stage .
opponents are concerned about fees that will add debts of around £ 9,000 to the £ 12,000 in student loans already owed by a typical university graduate .
insolvency service guidelines say student loans are on the list of debts that can be cancelled out by bankruptcy .
that will no longer be the case if the bill becomes law as expected by the end of july .
higher education minister alan johnson released the student loans company figures in response to a written question from liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis .
mr johnson 's department stressed later that bankruptcy was " not an easy route to clearing debts " - it could have an adverse affect on graduates ' employment prospects , earnings and credit rating .

a number are thought to have taken advantage of a loophole in government legislation allowing student loan debts to be cancelled out by bankruptcy .
the government is to close the loophole as part of the higher education bill .
cancelled out last week the bill was passed by a narrow majority of 316 votes to 311 , after 72 labour mps voted against plans for university top-up fees .
some rebel mps have vowed to fight on as the bill goes through its next stage in parliament .
mps are now likely to spend two to three months going through the bill line-by-line in its committee stage .
opponents of the bill are concerned about fees that will add debts of around £ 9,000 to the £ 12,000 in student loans already owed by a typical university graduate .

physical or party games , like playstation 2 's eyetoy , have gone some way to change that perception and have set pulses racing .
but there is a growing community of european gamers who are truly sweating it out weekly , even daily , on the dance floor - one that is about a metre squared .
ddr , dance dance revolution , started life as a konami arcade video game back in the late 1990s .
since then , there have been several version of the machine with catalogues of tracks on them .
a huge community has grown up around ddr in the usa and asia , particularly in japan , who are well-known lovers of musical games .
the us and japan have professional teams and are well organised in terms of competitions .
but after taking some faltering baby steps in europe , ddr has started to strut its stuff officially in the last three years .
sporty jigs " it has become very popular in several countries , but in many it is still completely unknown , " says ole petter hoie , managing director of positive gaming , co-organisers of the first official ddr europe tournament .
" but in the uk , italy and now in norway , it has become very big and it is growing in other countries also . "
to many within the ddr community , it is considered to be a sport , and it is about to be registered officially as such in norway .
the tournament , held in london last month , was the first official competition using rules which have been decided on by the ddr community . "
the online community powers the game , it 's what actually gives people the urge to actually go on and continue playing the game " myst , ddr : uk competitors from across the uk , as well as from norway and italy , were there to put their best foot forward .
to compete , dancers or players step on coloured arrows corresponding with directions displayed on the screen in front of them .
steps have to be taken in time to the beat of loud tunes , with names like boom dollar , butterfly , and dam dariam .
the competitors are judged on accuracy and are scored accordingly .
the cumulative result is a maniacal mix of " doof , doof , doof " of the songs and the rapid " thud , thudding " of trainer-clad feet .
and the harder the level , the faster and louder the action becomes .
one of the reasons why ddr has started to enjoy more prominence in europe is down to the part the net has played in strengthening and sustaining the community .
myst , or colin barker as he is known in the offline world , runs one of the biggest ddr community websites on the net .
with about 100 new members signing up a day , the site largely consists of web logs , forums , and downloadable simulators which allow ddr to be played on home computers .
" the online community is very important .
it 's what powers the game , it 's what actually gives people the urge to actually go on and continue playing the game , " he explained .
" even when they have played a song maybe 10 , 15 times , they get bored of the game .
" so , the online community help them out by saying ' i 'd like to challenge you , i 'd like to meet up with you ' and with that , you get people meeting up to have fun . "
for many , the appeal is the combination of social , technical , and musical elements all rolled into one game .
japanese fashion the best players have been doing it for two or three years , but some have started to shine after just over a year .
many practice first on the plastic home dance mats , which can be played on ps2 and xbox , before they publicly brave the arcade and the audience .
some , like myst , go so far as to buy their very own arcade machine to practice on .
" nowadays it is very fashionable to enjoy japanese culture and ddr as well as other musical games that come from japan , " explained benoit cotte , from m-games , a non-for-profit organisation which promotes musical games throughout europe .
" it targets mostly video games players , people who like innovation .
but it also combines music , which everybody likes , video games and sport . "
perhaps one of the biggest draws is that ddr is very much a spectator game , says mr benoit .
when the hot players like lion -lrb- italy -rrb- , snute -lrb- norway -rrb- , usagi , stel and ryosuke -lrb- all uk -rrb- take to the pads , it is a truly mesmerising game to behold .
the final stages of the tournament were nail-bitingly close .
stel , the only british hope left in the competition , and hot favourite , lost his footing and rhythm in the closing seconds of the final round .
the crown eventually went to italy 's lion , the quiet , black track suited figure who beat the 12-year-old norwegian snut by 100 points .

watching two at a time is mesmerising physical or party games , like playstation 2 's eyetoy , have gone some way to change that perception and have set pulses racing .
but there is a growing community of european gamers who are truly sweating it out weekly , even daily , on the dance floor - one that is about a metre squared .
ddr , dance dance revolution , started life as a konami arcade video game back in the late 1990s .
since then , there have been several version of the machine with catalogues of tracks on them .
a huge community has grown up around ddr in the usa and asia , particularly in japan , who are well-known lovers of musical games .
the us and japan have professional teams and are well organised in terms of competitions .
but after taking some faltering baby steps in europe , ddr has started to strut its stuff officially in the last three years .
sporty jigs " it has become very popular in several countries , but in many it is still completely unknown , " says ole petter hoie , managing director of positive gaming , co-organisers of the first official ddr europe tournament .
" but in the uk , italy and now in norway , it has become very big and it is growing in other countries also . "
to many within the ddr community , it is considered to be a sport , and it is about to be registered officially as such in norway .
the tournament , held in london last month , was the first official competition using rules which have been decided on by the ddr community .
the online community powers the game , it 's what actually gives people the urge to actually go on and continue playing the game myst , ddr : uk click here to see pictures from the tournament competitors from across the uk , as well as from norway and italy , were there to put their best foot forward .
to compete , dancers or players step on coloured arrows corresponding with directions displayed on the screen in front of them .
steps have to be taken in time to the beat of loud tunes , with names like boom dollar , butterfly , and dam dariam .
the competitors are judged on accuracy and are scored accordingly .
the cumulative result is a maniacal mix of " doof , doof , doof " of the songs and the rapid " thud , thudding " of trainer-clad feet .
and the harder the level , the faster and louder the action becomes .
one of the reasons why ddr has started to enjoy more prominence in europe is down to the part the net has played in strengthening and sustaining the community .
myst , or colin barker as he is known in the offline world , runs one of the biggest ddr community websites on the net .
with about 100 new members signing up a day , the site largely consists of web logs , forums , and downloadable simulators which allow ddr to be played on home computers .
" the online community is very important .
it 's what powers the game , it 's what actually gives people the urge to actually go on and continue playing the game , " he explained .
" even when they have played a song maybe 10 , 15 times , they get bored of the game .
" so , the online community help them out by saying ' i 'd like to challenge you , i 'd like to meet up with you ' and with that , you get people meeting up to have fun . "
for many , the appeal is the combination of social , technical , and musical elements all rolled into one game .
japanese fashion the best players have been doing it for two or three years , but some have started to shine after just over a year .
many practice first on the plastic home dance mats , which can be played on ps2 and xbox , before they publicly brave the arcade and the audience .
some , like myst , go so far as to buy their very own arcade machine to practice on .
it was a close-fought battle right until the closing steps " nowadays it is very fashionable to enjoy japanese culture and ddr as well as other musical games that come from japan , " explained benoit cotte , from m-games , a non-for-profit organisation which promotes musical games throughout europe .
" it targets mostly video games players , people who like innovation .
but it also combines music , which everybody likes , video games and sport . "
perhaps one of the biggest draws is that ddr is very much a spectator game , says mr benoit .
when the hot players like lion -lrb- italy -rrb- , snute -lrb- norway -rrb- , usagi , stel and ryosuke -lrb- all uk -rrb- take to the pads , it is a truly mesmerising game to behold .
the final stages of the tournament were nail-bitingly close .
stel , the only british hope left in the competition , and hot favourite , lost his footing and rhythm in the closing seconds of the final round .
the crown eventually went to italy 's lion , the quiet , black track suited figure who beat the 12-year-old norwegian snut by 100 points .
ultimately , it probably did not matter who won .

it was a close-fought battle right until the closing steps " nowadays it is very fashionable to enjoy japanese culture and ddr as well as other musical games that come from japan , " explained benoit cotte , from m-games , a non-for-profit organisation which promotes musical games throughout europe .
" it targets mostly video games players , people who like innovation .

perhaps one of the biggest draws is that ddr is very much a spectator game , says mr benoit .
when the hot players like lion -lrb- italy -rrb- , snute -lrb- norway -rrb- , usagi , stel and ryosuke -lrb- all uk -rrb- take to the pads , it is a truly mesmerising game to behold .
the final stages of the tournament were nail-bitingly close .
stel , the only british hope left in the competition , and hot favourite , lost his footing and rhythm in the closing seconds of the final round .
the crown eventually went to italy 's lion , the quiet , black track suited figure who beat the 12-year-old norwegian snut by 100 points .
ultimately , it probably did not matter who won .
for most , being able to express themselves , having fun , getting a bit of exercise , meeting old online pals and making new friends , is what counted .

japanese fashion the best players have been doing it for two or three years , but some have started to shine after just over a year .
many practice first on the plastic home dance mats , which can be played on ps2 and xbox , before they publicly brave the arcade and the audience .
some , like myst , go so far as to buy their very own arcade machine to practice on .
it was a close-fought battle right until the closing steps " nowadays it is very fashionable to enjoy japanese culture and ddr as well as other musical games that come from japan , " explained benoit cotte , from m-games , a non-for-profit organisation which promotes musical games throughout europe .

he was found guilty of allowing party employees from mr chirac 's former rpr party to be put on the payroll of paris city hall , when mr chirac was mayor and juppe its finance director .
juppe 's party and leader are backing him despite verdict the verdict raised fresh questions in france over mr chirac 's own conduct as mayor .
the president has also launched an official inquiry into allegations that the judges examining the juppe case were threatened and their offices were broken into in the run-up to the verdict .
on french tv and radio , mr chirac has dominated the headlines with his own personal reaction to the criminal conviction of his closest ally .
long mr chirac 's heir-apparent as president , juppe is still the head of his new ump political party too .
yet all was thrown into doubt when he was found guilty of helping illicitly fund the rpr in the early 1990s .
as finance director to mr chirac 's paris mayor , he put seven party employees on the municipal payroll .
i hold him in the highest esteem and respect him .
he is a politician of exceptional quality , with immense ability , humanity ... honesty president jacques chirac juppe was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence , which should automatically bar him from political office for the next decade .
yet mr chirac leapt to his defence , encouraging him to lodge an appeal against the sentence , to keep juppe at his side .
" alain juppe is a friend , " he said .
" i hold him in the highest esteem and respect him .
he is a politician of exceptional quality , with immense ability , humanity ... honesty .
and france needs men of such quality . "
the cameras were there too , as juppe arrived at work at his other job as mayor of bordeaux .
but he was reluctant to speak to waiting reporters , except to promise them fresh comment later .
juppe is expected to make a statement on tuesday on whether or not he plans to stay on in politics .
the facts date back to 10 years ago to a time when there was no official system to fund the parties and all parties used such means to finance themselves natalie kosciusko-morizet ump mp mps from his own party , the governing ump , such as natalie kosciusko-morizet , believe he must stay in office .
" the judgement of alain juppe is felt as very tough , very heavy by all politicians and also the population - nobody has ever suspected his personal probity , and the facts date back to 10 years ago to a time when there was no official system to fund the parties and all parties used such means to finance themselves , " she said .
she is horrified by suggestions in the french and foreign media that perhaps mr chirac 's own conduct while mayor of paris should also be put under the spotlight again .
an investigation into his own knowledge of the party funding scandal had to be halted after he claimed presidential immunity , as did a separate investigation into his expenses while mayor of paris .
yet ms kosciusko-morizet says no-one should use juppe 's conviction as a weapon against the president .
' disgusted ' " i am personally disgusted by a certain campaign arranged by people to call for the dishonesty of jacques chirac - he is in the situation where he has immunity , because he is the president and ca n't defend himself , and accusing somebody who ca n't defend himself is i feel disgusting , " she said .
legal experts say little or nothing can be done to investigate mr chirac while he remains in office , even if some prosecutors would like to .
it remains to be seen what can be found against the president and to what extent it can reach him florence faucher paris centre for the study of political science however , florence faucher of the paris centre for the study of political science says juppe 's conviction may cause some to ask questions .
" the decision on juppe is particularly close to mr chirac , because juppe is such a close ally of the president and because the affair is linked to the mayor of paris , a position mr chirac held from 1976 to 1995 , " she said .
" it 's getting closer to the president , however , it remains to be seen what can be found against the president and to what extent it can reach him . "

long mr chirac 's heir-apparent as president , juppe is still the head of his new ump political party too .
yet all was thrown into doubt when he was found guilty of helping illicitly fund the rpr in the early 1990s .
as finance director to mr chirac 's paris mayor , he put seven party employees on the municipal payroll . "
i hold him in the highest esteem and respect him .
he is a politician of exceptional quality , with immense ability , humanity ... honesty " president jacques chirac juppe was given an 18-month suspended prison sentence , which should automatically bar him from political office for the next decade .
yet mr chirac leapt to his defence , encouraging him to lodge an appeal against the sentence , to keep juppe at his side .
" alain juppe is a friend , " he said .
" i hold him in the highest esteem and respect him .
he is a politician of exceptional quality , with immense ability , humanity ... honesty .
and france needs men of such quality . "
the cameras were there too , as juppe arrived at work at his other job as mayor of bordeaux .
but he was reluctant to speak to waiting reporters , except to promise them fresh comment later .
juppe is expected to make a statement on tuesday on whether or not he plans to stay on in politics . "
the facts date back to 10 years ago to a time when there was no official system to fund the parties and all parties used such means to finance themselves " natalie kosciusko-morizet ump mp mps from his own party , the governing ump , such as natalie kosciusko-morizet , believe he must stay in office .
" the judgement of alain juppe is felt as very tough , very heavy by all politicians and also the population - nobody has ever suspected his personal probity , and the facts date back to 10 years ago to a time when there was no official system to fund the parties and all parties used such means to finance themselves , " she said .
she is horrified by suggestions in the french and foreign media that perhaps mr chirac 's own conduct while mayor of paris should also be put under the spotlight again .
an investigation into his own knowledge of the party funding scandal had to be halted after he claimed presidential immunity , as did a separate investigation into his expenses while mayor of paris .
yet ms kosciusko-morizet says no-one should use juppe 's conviction as a weapon against the president .
' disgusted ' " i am personally disgusted by a certain campaign arranged by people to call for the dishonesty of jacques chirac - he is in the situation where he has immunity , because he is the president and ca n't defend himself , and accusing somebody who ca n't defend himself is i feel disgusting , " she said .
legal experts say little or nothing can be done to investigate mr chirac while he remains in office , even if some prosecutors would like to . "
it remains to be seen what can be found against the president and to what extent it can reach him " florence faucher paris centre for the study of political science however , florence faucher of the paris centre for the study of political science says juppe 's conviction may cause some to ask questions .
" the decision on juppe is particularly close to mr chirac , because juppe is such a close ally of the president and because the affair is linked to the mayor of paris , a position mr chirac held from 1976 to 1995 , " she said .
" it 's getting closer to the president , however , it remains to be seen what can be found against the president and to what extent it can reach him . "
public reaction yet on the streets of paris , there 's little interest in finding out how much mr chirac knew about the illicit funding of his own party . "
perhaps these kind of people like mr chirac have lots of responsibilities and they do n't do this for money , so i think they do n't have to face justice for every kind of subject " french passer-by " he may have been corrupt in the past and maybe he still is , but it must be taken into account what he does as president , " one person told me .
another passer-by said : " perhaps these kind of people like mr chirac have lots of responsibilities and they do n't do this for money , so i think they do n't have to face justice for every kind of subject . "
what many are wondering , though , is who tapped the phones of the judges in the juppe case , and may even have tried to break into their offices ?
mr chirac has launched an inquiry , and conspiracy theories abound .
so what impact , if any , will this latest of so many scandals have on the french president ?
" as a president in office he has immunity from any indictment or sentencing but once he 's not in the elysee palace any more , god knows what might happen , " said charles lambroschini of the centre-right newspaper , le figaro .
mr chirac can stay in power for another three years - but without juppe at his side to control his party , he could be very vulnerable to other challengers for his crown , not least the ambitious interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
already , the seasoned mr chirac must be weighing his options - and hoping that his closest ally will still be by his side .

the assessment comes from the assets recovery agency , which has been investigating his activities .
the agency was set up to target the proceeds of organised crime .
the man 's identity has not been revealed .
the police referred the case to the ara which carried out an extensive investigation .
under the proceeds of crime act 2002 , the ara can assume the role of the inland revenue if it believes someone 's income comes from crime .
it said that in this case , issuing tax assessments was the most appropriate course of action .
special commissioners the agency said the amount owed excluded interest and penalties .
interest accrues on a daily basis from the date the tax was originally due .
the man now has 30 days to lodge an appeal .
the appeals process may involve negotiation with the agency 's tax advisers or may necessitate a hearing before the special commissioners of income tax .
if no appeal is lodged within 30 days , the agency begins enforcement .
interest and penalties which may be imposed - carried out in line with inland revenue practices - can often amount to an additional 50 % of the amount assessed .
the agency came into being in february 2002 as part of the government 's offensive against paramilitary groups who make money out of fuel and cigarette smuggling , counterfeiting , robbery and drug dealing .
it has been given a target of seizing £ 60m by 2004/5 , and has the power to seize assets and impose taxes .
new legislation also enforces those targeted to prove their money is legitimate .

a move to stage a referendum on the same day , asking about chinese missiles , has alarmed beijing , which worries that taiwan could use the mechanism to declare formal independence .
what 's the row about ?
the central issue is china 's worry that taiwan , which it regards as part of its territory , is moving by stealth towards formal independence .
china has repeatedly warned it will invade if taiwan declares itself an independent state .
although analysts are unsure whether that threat should still be taken seriously , the row between china and taiwan is still one of the most dangerous flashpoints in asia , especially since any conflict could quickly suck in the united states , taiwan 's chief military ally .
how did the split between taiwan and mainland china come about ?
the current differences between china and taiwan can be traced back to 1949 , when the communists defeated the nationalists in a civil war in china .
the beaten nationalists , led by chiang kai-shek 's kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- party , fled to taiwan , which chinese governments long regarded as their own territory .
since then , beijing has vowed to retake the island , by force if necessary .
the kmt also believed in eventual reunification with the mainland , so while it was in power in taiwan the main issue was when and how the island would be reunified with the mainland .
however , for many years there has been an independence movement in taiwan .
while the island was under martial law , until 1987 , this was a small movement .
but with the founding of the pro-independence democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- in 1986 it gained momentum .
in 2000 , the dpp 's chen shui-bian won the presidency , despite , and probably helped by , warnings from beijing about moves towards independence .
since then , the chinese leadership has refused to deal with president chen until he accepts that there is just one china , of which taiwan is a part .
mr chen has not accepted this point and so relations between the two have remained frosty .
so what triggered the latest furore ?
at first , president chen , a lawyer by profession , proved more pragmatic than many expected , toning down his party 's pro-independence position .
but from about mid-2002 , he started making a number of suggestions which have antagonised china .
some analysts in taiwan see his moves as being timed to win support ahead of the presidential election .
first he said china and taiwan were both countries on either side of the taiwan strait , or " one side , one country " -lrb- yi bian yi guo -rrb- - which seemed to flout beijing 's " one china " principle .
he also said that taiwan 's 23 million people should be able to hold referendums , a right which was enshrined in a referendum law passed in november 2003 .
president chen has said he wanted to stage a referendum to coincide with the presidential vote .
voters would be asked whether taiwan should increase its defences , if china refused to redeploy hundreds of missiles pointed at taiwan .
people would also be asked if they back opening negotiations with china .
president chen 's critics have called these moves disingenuous .
they say his goal is to win re-election by stoking fears about china , and his real agenda is to progressively edge taiwan towards de facto independence .
what about taiwan 's people , do they really want independence ?
it seems most taiwanese would like to ignore the question and keep the status quo .
taiwan has developed into one of the world 's leading economies and , in the political arena , there has been a relatively peaceful transition from martial law to democracy .
all this has been achieved without having to tackle the thorny issue of the island 's status , and most taiwanese do not want to rock the boat while things are going well .
having said that , there are hardliners within the dpp who want president chen to declare independence .
others who do not want him to go that far have a growing pride in their country .
the longer taiwan and china remain separated , the more independent people will feel .
will relations between china and taiwan ever be normalised ?
a great deal needs to happen before relations between china and taiwan approach anything near normality .
the central issue is taiwan 's status : is the island an independent country or will it eventually reunify with mainland china ?
china 's position has not budged an inch on this central issue since 1949 - it wants taiwan back .
but with even pro-reunification supporters in taiwan refusing to consider the possibility of reunification with a communist government in beijing , there seems little hope of any great diplomatic change in the near future .
