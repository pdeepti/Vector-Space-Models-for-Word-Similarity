" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

verheugen said the aim was to create new jobs especially in the services , training and leisure industries .
calling the plan a " real cultural revolution " but giving no details , verheugen , who is also deputy head of the eu executive , said he wanted to " dust off " the current strategy on growth .
outgoing commission chief romano prodi said in october that efforts to increase growth in the bloc had failed , accusing the 25 member states of using their veto to prevent changes .
at the lisbon summit in 2000 , eu leaders agreed on a program of reforms aimed at catching up with the united states economically and making europe the most competitive region in the world within a decade . dw-world.de germany 's verheugen changes gears germany 's günter verheugen will soon take on the portfolio for enterprise and industry at the european commission .
the former commissioner for eu enlargement has also been pegged to become one of five vice-presidents .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive . germany 's entry into the powerful un security council on jan .
1 , 2003 , as a two-year non-permanent member came at a time when the un 's top decision-making body was engulfed in crisis . us president bush had hinted that america would consider bypassing the international body in its resolve to remove the threat posed by iraq through its alleged weapons of mass destruction . saying the united nations would " be irrelevant " if it did n't " move deliberately and decisively to hold iraq to account , " bush sought to move against saddam hussein , whom he described as a “ grave and gathering danger . ” a fine balancing act under the delicate diplomatic circumstances , germany 's representatives to the un were under additional pressure given that chancellor gerhard schröder was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led military campaign against iraq . caught between american and british insistence on a preemptive strike against iraq on the one hand and a pacifist german foreign policy on the other , germany 's un diplomats , who also took over the security council presidency during the crucial weeks before the invasion , had their job cut out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador to the un gunter pleuger no one knows that better than günter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , who steps down at the end of 2004 as germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the security council draws to a close .
in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .

it also prevented the resolution authorizing war against iraq from getting a majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues in iraq long after the us invaded the country at the same time , though , germany 's efforts failed to prevent war .
a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .
but the exact opposite is true , " he said . " where would we be today in the whole world - in africa , in crisis regions in the middle east , in the balkans - without the united nations . " pleuger also took positive stock of germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member , its fourth since the council came into existence .
" i believe that in these two years , germany tried to represent focused and constructive politics , " he said . he pointed to german efforts to draw international attention to sudan and darfur .
" they were forgotten conflicts for a long time , " pleuger said .
" we tried during our presidency in the security council in april to bring the topics on the agenda . " last week government sources in berlin underlined germany 's positive image in new york during its security council rotation .
" we were sometimes treated like one of the five permanent members , " a german government official told reporters . that might sound like wishful thinking , but pleuger is convinced that the painstaking legwork of the past two years at the un will eventually secure germany a permanent seat at the security council . german sights trained on un seat for months , the country has been vigorously lobbying around the world in an effort to win over two-thirds of the 191 un members to gain a seat at the decision-making table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany , at the un security council in new york .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has tirelessly pointed out that germany already shoulders ten percent of the security council budget and has proved , through its participation in several military and civil un missions , its readiness to take on responsibility . " naturally , there are many possibilities and procedural tricks to block reform in the united nations , " pleuger said referring to well-known italian reservations to germany getting a permanent seat and simmering us discontent at germany 's war opposition .

in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .

a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .
but the exact opposite is true , " he said . " where would we be today in the whole world - in africa , in crisis regions in the middle east , in the balkans - without the united nations . " pleuger also took positive stock of germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member , its fourth since the council came into existence .
" i believe that in these two years , germany tried to represent focused and constructive politics , " he said . he pointed to german efforts to draw international attention to sudan and darfur .
" they were forgotten conflicts for a long time , " pleuger said .
" we tried during our presidency in the security council in april to bring the topics on the agenda . " last week government sources in berlin underlined germany 's positive image in new york during its security council rotation .
" we were sometimes treated like one of the five permanent members , " a german government official told reporters . that might sound like wishful thinking , but pleuger is convinced that the painstaking legwork of the past two years at the un will eventually secure germany a permanent seat at the security council . german sights trained on un seat for months , the country has been vigorously lobbying around the world in an effort to win over two-thirds of the 191 un members to gain a seat at the decision-making table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany , at the un security council in new york .

31 .
despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive . germany 's entry into the powerful un security council on jan .
1 , 2003 , as a two-year non-permanent member came at a time when the un 's top decision-making body was engulfed in crisis . us president bush had hinted that america would consider bypassing the international body in its resolve to remove the threat posed by iraq through its alleged weapons of mass destruction . saying the united nations would " be irrelevant " if it did n't " move deliberately and decisively to hold iraq to account , " bush sought to move against saddam hussein , whom he described as a “ grave and gathering danger . ” a fine balancing act under the delicate diplomatic circumstances , germany 's representatives to the un were under additional pressure given that chancellor gerhard schröder was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led military campaign against iraq . caught between american and british insistence on a preemptive strike against iraq on the one hand and a pacifist german foreign policy on the other , germany 's un diplomats , who also took over the security council presidency during the crucial weeks before the invasion , had their job cut out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador to the un gunter pleuger no one knows that better than günter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , who steps down at the end of 2004 as germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the security council draws to a close .
in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .
the remaining ten are elected as non-permanent members for periods of two years . pleuger 's efforts to create an anti-war lobby resulted in a new self-confidence among the non-permanent members in the security council .
it also prevented the resolution authorizing war against iraq from getting a majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues in iraq long after the us invaded the country at the same time , though , germany 's efforts failed to prevent war .
a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .
but the exact opposite is true , " he said . " where would we be today in the whole world - in africa , in crisis regions in the middle east , in the balkans - without the united nations . " pleuger also took positive stock of germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member , its fourth since the council came into existence .
" i believe that in these two years , germany tried to represent focused and constructive politics , " he said . he pointed to german efforts to draw international attention to sudan and darfur .
" they were forgotten conflicts for a long time , " pleuger said .
" we tried during our presidency in the security council in april to bring the topics on the agenda . " last week government sources in berlin underlined germany 's positive image in new york during its security council rotation .
" we were sometimes treated like one of the five permanent members , " a german government official told reporters . that might sound like wishful thinking , but pleuger is convinced that the painstaking legwork of the past two years at the un will eventually secure germany a permanent seat at the security council . german sights trained on un seat for months , the country has been vigorously lobbying around the world in an effort to win over two-thirds of the 191 un members to gain a seat at the decision-making table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany , at the un security council in new york .

tourism operators thomas cook , rewe , pauschaltouristik , meier 's weltreisen and dertour have cancelled flights to the worst hit areas .
instead , many companies have been flying empty planes to the crisis-struck region to bring tourists back to europe .
the first plane of erstwhile holidaymakers returned on monday morning to germany on a thai airways flight from phuket and bangkok to frankfurt am main . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai soldiers sit in front of empty coffins to be transported to phuket at bangkok military airport on monday thailand has escaped relatively lightly compared to the calamitous tolls in sri lanka and indonesia .
but as southeast asia 's busiest tourist destination , with 12 million foreign visits expected this year , it is undergoing a herculean tourist evacuation .
hundreds of rescue ships , helicopters and planes have been mobilized to move foreign visitors , estimated by a tourism official as topping 100,000 , who had packed into southern thailand 's famed resorts for christmas and new year . thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra , overseeing the rescue operations , vowed to fly any foreign visitor in need back to his or her country free of charge .
" any tourists who wanted to leave thailand , we will issue a certificate of identification to use as their passports and thailand will pay all expenses . " an emergency services director for thai airways said the government was encouraging all foreign tourists to leave southern thailand and return to bangkok or their home countries .
beach holidays in sri lanka , where at least 70 foreign tourists have died , dozens of german and british vacationers who survived tidal waves moved to a makeshift refugee center before cutting short their holidays and leaving , as the island 's official death toll climbed to well over 5,000 . bildunterschrift : a map of the countries affected by the quake bruised and shaken , men and women huddled at a conference center where tour operators set up desks to arrange for the evacuation of the tourists .
" we have never experienced anything like this before , " briton ken babb told afp .
" this is not an adventure .
this is a disaster . " tourist melony maas , one of thousands of germans said to be holidaying on the beach , said she and her mother wanted to help the sri lankan staff at their hotel after the first tidal wave , but the staff insisted they leave .
" i can not describe how i feel , " maas said as she awaited a flight home . " this is very sad for the sri lankan people .
a lot of poor people have died . " " this is my second visit to sri lanka .
what i want now is to get back , but i will come again , " she vowed . and indeed for the majority of tourists who were able to flee the region , the catastrophe will leave little more than negative memories .
for the hundreds of thousands of people who call the region home , the work of caring for families and friends , rebuilding houses and businesses and securing drinking water and medical supplies has just begun .
the clean-up process will take weeks and months . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / win -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fears for thousands of tourists in tidal wave zone thousands of europeans and other holidaymakers in south asia were feared hit by sunday 's huge tidal waves .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 27.12.2004 opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians have high expectations of president-elect yushchenko with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .
dw 's ute schaeffer assessed the task he faces . ukraine 's next president is viktor yushchenko .
the political change the west hoped for and the ukrainians demanded has happened .
and it has been legitimized by a free and fair election .
but the real work has yet to be done .
creating a democracy and the rule of law will require more time and be significantly more cumbersome than re-staging the ballot . the campaign was n't about personalities or even election platforms over the past few weeks .
it was a contest between an overly powerful state that pulled all the stops to put " its " candidate in office against a democratically oriented public , courageous students , protesting journalists , critical businesspeople . they triumphed .
democracy triumphed .
now , democracy must be established at all levels of government and business .
it 's a formidable task . the voters gave viktor yushchenko a clear mandate : more democracy and genuine life prospects .
yushchenko is supposed to quickly improve the standard of living - in the countryside , too - and ensure that pensions and stipends are both regularly paid and increased .
daunting work ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko the meshwork of political and business interests will be more complicated to deal with .
yushchenko will have to maneuver cleverly , since the competing groups that have very profitably split up politics , business and the mass media between themselves pursue quite different aims .
none of them will be willing to cede power . yushchenko will have to fight the corruption and cronyism that pervade ukrainian politics , business and society - a task that cost him his job as prime minister in 2001 .
the issue is implementing efficient economic policies whose profits do n't only benefit a select few , but rather as tax money paying into social costs and developing the infrastructure .
it 's a matter of drastically modernizing industry and business so ukraine can sell its products better .
and , not least , it 's about a multifaceted foreign policy upon which ukraine , with its many borders , is existentially dependent . yushchenko can gauge what will be expected of him .
he has asserted his position in ukraine 's political system with its numerous groups and knows how to cater to the differing political interests .
thus , many people say he lacks the political leadership qualities .
on the other hand , the only way to survive in ukraine 's fractured political spectrum is to find a balance and bring all parties together . more than words required of europe so far europe has offered ukraine little more than warm words .
now is the time for the western neighbors to finally turn towards ukraine .
the political change that was ushered in by the election does n't merely need time , it also needs active support from outside . a politically stable , peaceful and democratic ukraine means more security for europe .

they destroyed houses and hotels , flooded entire villages , and by latest accounts , swept more than 20,000 people to their deaths .
thousands more are injured , homeless , or counted as missing . eyewitnesses such as deutsche welle correspondent t.s.v. hari in madras , india , reported that the tsunamis came out of nowhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people look at a car and debris that was washed by tidal waves in madras , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu , sunday , dec .
26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean .

26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .

26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .

" since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.12.2004 -pipe- 15:00 utc press : un to take terrorist off terror list the united nations is to strike a convicted jordanian extremist from its list of terror suspects following a request from german authorities , newsweekly der spiegel reported in its monday issue .
the magazine said shadi abdellah , who was jailed by a german court in november 2003 for four years on charges of membership in a terrorist organization , would be the first suspect to be taken from the un list .
abdallah , who claimed to work briefly as a bodyguard for al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , was released from prison in november after serving more than half his sentence .
der spiegel said that because abdellah has cooperated with german authorities , berlin had put in the request to " rehabilitate " him .
he had figured on the un terror suspects list since 2003 .
the report said the effort met with initial resistance from us authorities , who said that abdellah was lying to feign cooperation with german police .
but german interior minister otto schily intervened and allowed us investigators to question abdellah , who is now to testify in the us trial of frenchman zacarias moussaoui , the only person facing criminal charges directly linked to the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , according to the report .
a spokesman from the german interior ministry refused to comment . dw-world.de germany creates new terror center german interior minister otto schily has opened a new center for combating terrorism in berlin .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .

for the roughly 150,000 people addicted to gambling in germany , money is a means to an end . pathological gamblers are fully absorbed by their addiction .
they feel like they 've lost control when they ca n't play and become irritable and nervous .
they 'll risk anything for a game and often end up abandoned , alone and in debt , in germany to the tune of € 25,000 -lrb- $ 33,400 -rrb- on average . the health ministry in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's largest state , added pathological gambling to its addiction program in 2001 , leading to an increase in the therapy , outreach and treatment options .
but in recognizing the problem the state put itself in an odd dilemma , according to marcus nebel , who works for the catholic charity caritas and focuses on gambling addicts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's states make millions from the national lottery .

on the other hand , north rhine-westphalia has a responsibility to protect its residents ' health . loosing it all hermann , from cologne , is one of them .
at the age of 16 he started playing gambling machines with friends in snack bars and pubs .

hermann was also egged on by the feeling of power that gambling gave him and the illusion that allowed him to forget all his problems .
no win was big enough to convince him he 'd played enough .
he could n't leave a gambling hall without emptying his pockets .
finally , his salary could no longer pay for his addiction .

but more and more discerning customers are turning away from such thinking and instead are looking for organic quality . stores with names such as " basic , " " eat organic " and " supernatural " are sprouting up across germany to fill the niche .
while at first sight they look like regular supermarkets , they 're actually quite different : the design 's a little more tasteful , shop assistants seem friendlier and the tomatoes appear a touch juicier than in other places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural and consumer protection minister renate künast poses in front of organic food products at a organic food trade fair such " bio supermarkets " now exist in most german cities and represent the next generation of organic food stores , according to christoph spahn , a consultant for health food stores .
compared to old-fashioned organic food stores , bio supermarkets have much larger self-service sections , he said , adding that people who work there still know what they 're talking about . " i can still ask them about something and they 'll be able to give me expert advice , " he said . dried-up carrots vs. hedonism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small organic food store in germany for years , many germans associated dried-up carrots and canvas shopping bags with organic food stores .
most people avoided such shops because they were considered more expensive than the regular supermarkets .
they derided organic food lovers , who bought their tofu and musli in health food stores . that 's changed , according to spahn . " there 's much fewer classic organic food buyers than before , " he said , adding that stores have also shifted from an orientation towards families to a more hedonistic audience . just like their customers , health food stores have also changed appearance .
the stores are larger now and more of them - more than 200 now exist nation-wide .
they lure customers by saying that they sell products for less than other organic stores and seem to be successful with this strategy . growing trend according to spahn , about one fifth of revenues in the organic food sector now comes from " bio supermarkets , " and the consultant said he believes this trend will continue .
spahn expects revenues from organic supermarkets to double in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some regular german supermarkets have also started selling organic foods , such as bananas .
others said health food supermarkets are also more in line with lifestyle trends .
andrew murphy , the chief executive of supernatural , a chain that runs five organic supermarkets in germany 's rhineland region , said the demand remains greater than what 's on offer . " people are sick and tired of eating products that taste like baby food , " he said . " during the last couple of years , people have been told that ' stinginess is cool , " ' murphy added , referring to the popular advertising slogan of an german electronics supermarket .

26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia . " since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 27.12.2004 opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians have high expectations of president-elect yushchenko with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .
dw 's ute schaeffer assessed the task he faces . ukraine 's next president is viktor yushchenko .
the political change the west hoped for and the ukrainians demanded has happened .
and it has been legitimized by a free and fair election .
but the real work has yet to be done .
creating a democracy and the rule of law will require more time and be significantly more cumbersome than re-staging the ballot . the campaign was n't about personalities or even election platforms over the past few weeks .
it was a contest between an overly powerful state that pulled all the stops to put " its " candidate in office against a democratically oriented public , courageous students , protesting journalists , critical businesspeople . they triumphed .
democracy triumphed .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 27.12.2004 opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians have high expectations of president-elect yushchenko with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .
dw 's ute schaeffer assessed the task he faces . ukraine 's next president is viktor yushchenko .
the political change the west hoped for and the ukrainians demanded has happened .
and it has been legitimized by a free and fair election .
but the real work has yet to be done .
creating a democracy and the rule of law will require more time and be significantly more cumbersome than re-staging the ballot . the campaign was n't about personalities or even election platforms over the past few weeks .
it was a contest between an overly powerful state that pulled all the stops to put " its " candidate in office against a democratically oriented public , courageous students , protesting journalists , critical businesspeople . they triumphed .
democracy triumphed .
now , democracy must be established at all levels of government and business .
it 's a formidable task . the voters gave viktor yushchenko a clear mandate : more democracy and genuine life prospects .
yushchenko is supposed to quickly improve the standard of living - in the countryside , too - and ensure that pensions and stipends are both regularly paid and increased .
daunting work ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko the meshwork of political and business interests will be more complicated to deal with .
yushchenko will have to maneuver cleverly , since the competing groups that have very profitably split up politics , business and the mass media between themselves pursue quite different aims .
none of them will be willing to cede power . yushchenko will have to fight the corruption and cronyism that pervade ukrainian politics , business and society - a task that cost him his job as prime minister in 2001 .
the issue is implementing efficient economic policies whose profits do n't only benefit a select few , but rather as tax money paying into social costs and developing the infrastructure .
it 's a matter of drastically modernizing industry and business so ukraine can sell its products better .
and , not least , it 's about a multifaceted foreign policy upon which ukraine , with its many borders , is existentially dependent . yushchenko can gauge what will be expected of him .
he has asserted his position in ukraine 's political system with its numerous groups and knows how to cater to the differing political interests .
thus , many people say he lacks the political leadership qualities .
on the other hand , the only way to survive in ukraine 's fractured political spectrum is to find a balance and bring all parties together . more than words required of europe so far europe has offered ukraine little more than warm words .
now is the time for the western neighbors to finally turn towards ukraine .
the political change that was ushered in by the election does n't merely need time , it also needs active support from outside . a politically stable , peaceful and democratic ukraine means more security for europe .
that 's why brussels and berlin should n't disregard the opportunities that arise from the election result . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.12.2004 " bio food " goes big in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks just like the regular grocery store organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent . germany is a country of discount supermarkets : chains such as aldi , lidl or plus attract customers who want as much as possible for as little as possible .
but more and more discerning customers are turning away from such thinking and instead are looking for organic quality . stores with names such as " basic , " " eat organic " and " supernatural " are sprouting up across germany to fill the niche .
while at first sight they look like regular supermarkets , they 're actually quite different : the design 's a little more tasteful , shop assistants seem friendlier and the tomatoes appear a touch juicier than in other places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural and consumer protection minister renate künast poses in front of organic food products at a organic food trade fair such " bio supermarkets " now exist in most german cities and represent the next generation of organic food stores , according to christoph spahn , a consultant for health food stores .
compared to old-fashioned organic food stores , bio supermarkets have much larger self-service sections , he said , adding that people who work there still know what they 're talking about . " i can still ask them about something and they 'll be able to give me expert advice , " he said . dried-up carrots vs. hedonism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small organic food store in germany for years , many germans associated dried-up carrots and canvas shopping bags with organic food stores .
most people avoided such shops because they were considered more expensive than the regular supermarkets .
they derided organic food lovers , who bought their tofu and musli in health food stores . that 's changed , according to spahn . " there 's much fewer classic organic food buyers than before , " he said , adding that stores have also shifted from an orientation towards families to a more hedonistic audience . just like their customers , health food stores have also changed appearance .
the stores are larger now and more of them - more than 200 now exist nation-wide .
they lure customers by saying that they sell products for less than other organic stores and seem to be successful with this strategy . growing trend according to spahn , about one fifth of revenues in the organic food sector now comes from " bio supermarkets , " and the consultant said he believes this trend will continue .
spahn expects revenues from organic supermarkets to double in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some regular german supermarkets have also started selling organic foods , such as bananas .
others said health food supermarkets are also more in line with lifestyle trends .
andrew murphy , the chief executive of supernatural , a chain that runs five organic supermarkets in germany 's rhineland region , said the demand remains greater than what 's on offer . " people are sick and tired of eating products that taste like baby food , " he said . " during the last couple of years , people have been told that ' stinginess is cool , " ' murphy added , referring to the popular advertising slogan of an german electronics supermarket .
" for us it 's good tasting products that are cool .

in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake .

31 .
despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive . germany 's entry into the powerful un security council on jan .
1 , 2003 , as a two-year non-permanent member came at a time when the un 's top decision-making body was engulfed in crisis . us president bush had hinted that america would consider bypassing the international body in its resolve to remove the threat posed by iraq through its alleged weapons of mass destruction . saying the united nations would " be irrelevant " if it did n't " move deliberately and decisively to hold iraq to account , " bush sought to move against saddam hussein , whom he described as a “ grave and gathering danger . ” a fine balancing act under the delicate diplomatic circumstances , germany 's representatives to the un were under additional pressure given that chancellor gerhard schröder was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led military campaign against iraq . caught between american and british insistence on a preemptive strike against iraq on the one hand and a pacifist german foreign policy on the other , germany 's un diplomats , who also took over the security council presidency during the crucial weeks before the invasion , had their job cut out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador to the un gunter pleuger no one knows that better than günter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , who steps down at the end of 2004 as germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the security council draws to a close .
in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .
the remaining ten are elected as non-permanent members for periods of two years . pleuger 's efforts to create an anti-war lobby resulted in a new self-confidence among the non-permanent members in the security council .
it also prevented the resolution authorizing war against iraq from getting a majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues in iraq long after the us invaded the country at the same time , though , germany 's efforts failed to prevent war .
a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .
but the exact opposite is true , " he said . " where would we be today in the whole world - in africa , in crisis regions in the middle east , in the balkans - without the united nations . " pleuger also took positive stock of germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member , its fourth since the council came into existence .
" i believe that in these two years , germany tried to represent focused and constructive politics , " he said . he pointed to german efforts to draw international attention to sudan and darfur .
" they were forgotten conflicts for a long time , " pleuger said .
" we tried during our presidency in the security council in april to bring the topics on the agenda . " last week government sources in berlin underlined germany 's positive image in new york during its security council rotation .
" we were sometimes treated like one of the five permanent members , " a german government official told reporters . that might sound like wishful thinking , but pleuger is convinced that the painstaking legwork of the past two years at the un will eventually secure germany a permanent seat at the security council . german sights trained on un seat for months , the country has been vigorously lobbying around the world in an effort to win over two-thirds of the 191 un members to gain a seat at the decision-making table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany , at the un security council in new york .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has tirelessly pointed out that germany already shoulders ten percent of the security council budget and has proved , through its participation in several military and civil un missions , its readiness to take on responsibility . " naturally , there are many possibilities and procedural tricks to block reform in the united nations , " pleuger said referring to well-known italian reservations to germany getting a permanent seat and simmering us discontent at germany 's war opposition .

but more and more discerning customers are turning away from such thinking and instead are looking for organic quality . stores with names such as " basic , " " eat organic " and " supernatural " are sprouting up across germany to fill the niche .

they lure customers by saying that they sell products for less than other organic stores and seem to be successful with this strategy . growing trend according to spahn , about one fifth of revenues in the organic food sector now comes from " bio supermarkets , " and the consultant said he believes this trend will continue .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .

ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels .

26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia . " since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

they destroyed houses and hotels , flooded entire villages , and by latest accounts , swept more than 20,000 people to their deaths .
thousands more are injured , homeless , or counted as missing . eyewitnesses such as deutsche welle correspondent t.s.v. hari in madras , india , reported that the tsunamis came out of nowhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people look at a car and debris that was washed by tidal waves in madras , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu , sunday , dec .
26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia . " since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.12.2004 " bio food " goes big in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks just like the regular grocery store organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent . germany is a country of discount supermarkets : chains such as aldi , lidl or plus attract customers who want as much as possible for as little as possible .
but more and more discerning customers are turning away from such thinking and instead are looking for organic quality . stores with names such as " basic , " " eat organic " and " supernatural " are sprouting up across germany to fill the niche .
while at first sight they look like regular supermarkets , they 're actually quite different : the design 's a little more tasteful , shop assistants seem friendlier and the tomatoes appear a touch juicier than in other places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural and consumer protection minister renate künast poses in front of organic food products at a organic food trade fair such " bio supermarkets " now exist in most german cities and represent the next generation of organic food stores , according to christoph spahn , a consultant for health food stores .
compared to old-fashioned organic food stores , bio supermarkets have much larger self-service sections , he said , adding that people who work there still know what they 're talking about . " i can still ask them about something and they 'll be able to give me expert advice , " he said . dried-up carrots vs. hedonism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small organic food store in germany for years , many germans associated dried-up carrots and canvas shopping bags with organic food stores .
most people avoided such shops because they were considered more expensive than the regular supermarkets .
they derided organic food lovers , who bought their tofu and musli in health food stores . that 's changed , according to spahn .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

31 .
despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive . germany 's entry into the powerful un security council on jan .
1 , 2003 , as a two-year non-permanent member came at a time when the un 's top decision-making body was engulfed in crisis . us president bush had hinted that america would consider bypassing the international body in its resolve to remove the threat posed by iraq through its alleged weapons of mass destruction . saying the united nations would " be irrelevant " if it did n't " move deliberately and decisively to hold iraq to account , " bush sought to move against saddam hussein , whom he described as a “ grave and gathering danger . ” a fine balancing act under the delicate diplomatic circumstances , germany 's representatives to the un were under additional pressure given that chancellor gerhard schröder was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led military campaign against iraq . caught between american and british insistence on a preemptive strike against iraq on the one hand and a pacifist german foreign policy on the other , germany 's un diplomats , who also took over the security council presidency during the crucial weeks before the invasion , had their job cut out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador to the un gunter pleuger no one knows that better than günter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , who steps down at the end of 2004 as germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the security council draws to a close .
in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .
the remaining ten are elected as non-permanent members for periods of two years . pleuger 's efforts to create an anti-war lobby resulted in a new self-confidence among the non-permanent members in the security council .
it also prevented the resolution authorizing war against iraq from getting a majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues in iraq long after the us invaded the country at the same time , though , germany 's efforts failed to prevent war .
a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .

tourism operators thomas cook , rewe , pauschaltouristik , meier 's weltreisen and dertour have cancelled flights to the worst hit areas .
instead , many companies have been flying empty planes to the crisis-struck region to bring tourists back to europe .
the first plane of erstwhile holidaymakers returned on monday morning to germany on a thai airways flight from phuket and bangkok to frankfurt am main . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai soldiers sit in front of empty coffins to be transported to phuket at bangkok military airport on monday thailand has escaped relatively lightly compared to the calamitous tolls in sri lanka and indonesia .
but as southeast asia 's busiest tourist destination , with 12 million foreign visits expected this year , it is undergoing a herculean tourist evacuation .
hundreds of rescue ships , helicopters and planes have been mobilized to move foreign visitors , estimated by a tourism official as topping 100,000 , who had packed into southern thailand 's famed resorts for christmas and new year . thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra , overseeing the rescue operations , vowed to fly any foreign visitor in need back to his or her country free of charge .
" any tourists who wanted to leave thailand , we will issue a certificate of identification to use as their passports and thailand will pay all expenses . " an emergency services director for thai airways said the government was encouraging all foreign tourists to leave southern thailand and return to bangkok or their home countries .
beach holidays in sri lanka , where at least 70 foreign tourists have died , dozens of german and british vacationers who survived tidal waves moved to a makeshift refugee center before cutting short their holidays and leaving , as the island 's official death toll climbed to well over 5,000 . bildunterschrift : a map of the countries affected by the quake bruised and shaken , men and women huddled at a conference center where tour operators set up desks to arrange for the evacuation of the tourists .
" we have never experienced anything like this before , " briton ken babb told afp .
" this is not an adventure .
this is a disaster . " tourist melony maas , one of thousands of germans said to be holidaying on the beach , said she and her mother wanted to help the sri lankan staff at their hotel after the first tidal wave , but the staff insisted they leave .
" i can not describe how i feel , " maas said as she awaited a flight home . " this is very sad for the sri lankan people .
a lot of poor people have died . " " this is my second visit to sri lanka .
what i want now is to get back , but i will come again , " she vowed . and indeed for the majority of tourists who were able to flee the region , the catastrophe will leave little more than negative memories .
for the hundreds of thousands of people who call the region home , the work of caring for families and friends , rebuilding houses and businesses and securing drinking water and medical supplies has just begun .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 27.12.2004 opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians have high expectations of president-elect yushchenko with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .
dw 's ute schaeffer assessed the task he faces . ukraine 's next president is viktor yushchenko .
the political change the west hoped for and the ukrainians demanded has happened .
and it has been legitimized by a free and fair election .
but the real work has yet to be done .
creating a democracy and the rule of law will require more time and be significantly more cumbersome than re-staging the ballot . the campaign was n't about personalities or even election platforms over the past few weeks .
it was a contest between an overly powerful state that pulled all the stops to put " its " candidate in office against a democratically oriented public , courageous students , protesting journalists , critical businesspeople . they triumphed .
democracy triumphed .
now , democracy must be established at all levels of government and business .
it 's a formidable task . the voters gave viktor yushchenko a clear mandate : more democracy and genuine life prospects .
yushchenko is supposed to quickly improve the standard of living - in the countryside , too - and ensure that pensions and stipends are both regularly paid and increased .
daunting work ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko the meshwork of political and business interests will be more complicated to deal with .
yushchenko will have to maneuver cleverly , since the competing groups that have very profitably split up politics , business and the mass media between themselves pursue quite different aims .
none of them will be willing to cede power . yushchenko will have to fight the corruption and cronyism that pervade ukrainian politics , business and society - a task that cost him his job as prime minister in 2001 .
the issue is implementing efficient economic policies whose profits do n't only benefit a select few , but rather as tax money paying into social costs and developing the infrastructure .
it 's a matter of drastically modernizing industry and business so ukraine can sell its products better .
and , not least , it 's about a multifaceted foreign policy upon which ukraine , with its many borders , is existentially dependent . yushchenko can gauge what will be expected of him .
he has asserted his position in ukraine 's political system with its numerous groups and knows how to cater to the differing political interests .
thus , many people say he lacks the political leadership qualities .
on the other hand , the only way to survive in ukraine 's fractured political spectrum is to find a balance and bring all parties together . more than words required of europe so far europe has offered ukraine little more than warm words .
now is the time for the western neighbors to finally turn towards ukraine .
the political change that was ushered in by the election does n't merely need time , it also needs active support from outside . a politically stable , peaceful and democratic ukraine means more security for europe .
that 's why brussels and berlin should n't disregard the opportunities that arise from the election result . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

they destroyed houses and hotels , flooded entire villages , and by latest accounts , swept more than 20,000 people to their deaths .
thousands more are injured , homeless , or counted as missing . eyewitnesses such as deutsche welle correspondent t.s.v. hari in madras , india , reported that the tsunamis came out of nowhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people look at a car and debris that was washed by tidal waves in madras , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu , sunday , dec .
26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia .

26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia .

they destroyed houses and hotels , flooded entire villages , and by latest accounts , swept more than 20,000 people to their deaths .
thousands more are injured , homeless , or counted as missing . eyewitnesses such as deutsche welle correspondent t.s.v. hari in madras , india , reported that the tsunamis came out of nowhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people look at a car and debris that was washed by tidal waves in madras , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu , sunday , dec .
26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia . " since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

they destroyed houses and hotels , flooded entire villages , and by latest accounts , swept more than 20,000 people to their deaths .
thousands more are injured , homeless , or counted as missing . eyewitnesses such as deutsche welle correspondent t.s.v. hari in madras , india , reported that the tsunamis came out of nowhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people look at a car and debris that was washed by tidal waves in madras , in the southern indian state of tamil nadu , sunday , dec .
26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia . " since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

26 , 2004 .
a massive tidal wave triggered by an earthquake in indonesia slammed into several parts of southern india sunday killing at least 286 people , most of them in tamil nadu state .
the u.s. geological survey said the 8.9-magnitude earthquake in indonesia is the largest in the world in 40 years .
-lrb- ap photo / m.lakshman -rrb- " there was absolutely no warning , it all happened so suddenly , " hari said .
" there was just this huge wall of water .
and it was only a matter of minutes before this huge wave reached people here . " " cars , people , cattle - everything in its path was just swept away , " he recounted . the tsunamis were caused by an underwater earthquake close to the island of sumatra .
the quake measured 9.0 on the richter scale - by far , the strongest earthquake to have hit in over 40 years . what is a tsunami ? scientists explained that the area just off sumatra 's southwest coast is particularly dangerous , as it 's where two tectonic plates meet , grinding together and sending periodic tremors throughout the region .
with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean .

" since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

with sunday 's violent rupture , the seafloor was shunted vertically by about 10 meters , generating a massive wave , said rainer kind , seismologist at the geological research center in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : map showing the epicenter of the devastating earthquake " we 're talking about violent shifts in the sea floor , which of course resulted in the displacement of masses of water .
the wave which formed fanned out in all directions on the open sea .
from ships sailing in the area , the waves are difficult to recognize .
but when such a wave hits a coastal area , it can easily build up into ten-meter high waves , which have devastating consequences , " kind said . warning is possible kind acknowledged that the quake itself would have been impossible to predict , as scientists still know too little about what happens deep inside the earth 's core .
but , he said , an early warning about the dangerous tsunamis certainly would have been possible . " tsunamis are predictable , because once there 's been a quake , you know that a tsunami could develop .
and then you could predict that after so many hours , the waves would hit , for example , sri lanka or india .
these countries could have had the situation better under control .
but , as we 've heard , the indian ocean does n't have such an early warning system in place , unlike the pacific ocean . " a warning center such as those used around the pacific could have saved most of the thousands of people who died in the tsunamis in asia , said waverly person of the united states geological survey . " most of those people could have been saved if they had had a tsunami warning system in place or tide gauges , " he said .
" i think this will be a lesson to them , " person said , referring to the governments of the devastated countries . once an underwater earthquake hits , there is usually time - from 20 minutes to two hours - to get people away from the shores as the tsunami builds in the ocean . " people along the japanese coasts , along the coasts of california - people are taught to move away from the coasts .
but a lot of these people in the area where this occurred - they probably had no kind of lessons or knowledge of tsunamis because they are so rare , " person said . more waves to come ? kind did n't exclude the possibility of further after-shocks and more tsunamis in southern asia . " since the main quake , there have already been several strong after-shocks in the region north and south of the epicentre .
we ca n't yet predict when the quakes will be over .
there could be a second strong quake at anytime , which could result in further tsunamis , " kind said . us seismologists disagreed , saying it was unlikely the indian ocean region would be hit again anytime soon because it takes a very strong earthquake to trigger a tsunami . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany assures help after quake from the maldives to sri lanka to thailand , thousands of distraught foreign tourists were fleeing once-idyllic asian coastal resorts after huge tidal waves spawned by an earthquake battered the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.12.2004 " bio food " goes big in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks just like the regular grocery store organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent . germany is a country of discount supermarkets : chains such as aldi , lidl or plus attract customers who want as much as possible for as little as possible .
but more and more discerning customers are turning away from such thinking and instead are looking for organic quality . stores with names such as " basic , " " eat organic " and " supernatural " are sprouting up across germany to fill the niche .
while at first sight they look like regular supermarkets , they 're actually quite different : the design 's a little more tasteful , shop assistants seem friendlier and the tomatoes appear a touch juicier than in other places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural and consumer protection minister renate künast poses in front of organic food products at a organic food trade fair such " bio supermarkets " now exist in most german cities and represent the next generation of organic food stores , according to christoph spahn , a consultant for health food stores .
compared to old-fashioned organic food stores , bio supermarkets have much larger self-service sections , he said , adding that people who work there still know what they 're talking about . " i can still ask them about something and they 'll be able to give me expert advice , " he said . dried-up carrots vs. hedonism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small organic food store in germany for years , many germans associated dried-up carrots and canvas shopping bags with organic food stores .
most people avoided such shops because they were considered more expensive than the regular supermarkets .
they derided organic food lovers , who bought their tofu and musli in health food stores . that 's changed , according to spahn . " there 's much fewer classic organic food buyers than before , " he said , adding that stores have also shifted from an orientation towards families to a more hedonistic audience . just like their customers , health food stores have also changed appearance .
the stores are larger now and more of them - more than 200 now exist nation-wide .
they lure customers by saying that they sell products for less than other organic stores and seem to be successful with this strategy . growing trend according to spahn , about one fifth of revenues in the organic food sector now comes from " bio supermarkets , " and the consultant said he believes this trend will continue .
spahn expects revenues from organic supermarkets to double in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some regular german supermarkets have also started selling organic foods , such as bananas .
others said health food supermarkets are also more in line with lifestyle trends .
andrew murphy , the chief executive of supernatural , a chain that runs five organic supermarkets in germany 's rhineland region , said the demand remains greater than what 's on offer . " people are sick and tired of eating products that taste like baby food , " he said . " during the last couple of years , people have been told that ' stinginess is cool , " ' murphy added , referring to the popular advertising slogan of an german electronics supermarket .

they lure customers by saying that they sell products for less than other organic stores and seem to be successful with this strategy . growing trend according to spahn , about one fifth of revenues in the organic food sector now comes from " bio supermarkets , " and the consultant said he believes this trend will continue .

31 .
despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive . germany 's entry into the powerful un security council on jan .
1 , 2003 , as a two-year non-permanent member came at a time when the un 's top decision-making body was engulfed in crisis . us president bush had hinted that america would consider bypassing the international body in its resolve to remove the threat posed by iraq through its alleged weapons of mass destruction . saying the united nations would " be irrelevant " if it did n't " move deliberately and decisively to hold iraq to account , " bush sought to move against saddam hussein , whom he described as a “ grave and gathering danger . ” a fine balancing act under the delicate diplomatic circumstances , germany 's representatives to the un were under additional pressure given that chancellor gerhard schröder was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led military campaign against iraq . caught between american and british insistence on a preemptive strike against iraq on the one hand and a pacifist german foreign policy on the other , germany 's un diplomats , who also took over the security council presidency during the crucial weeks before the invasion , had their job cut out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador to the un gunter pleuger no one knows that better than günter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , who steps down at the end of 2004 as germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the security council draws to a close .
in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .
the remaining ten are elected as non-permanent members for periods of two years . pleuger 's efforts to create an anti-war lobby resulted in a new self-confidence among the non-permanent members in the security council .
it also prevented the resolution authorizing war against iraq from getting a majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues in iraq long after the us invaded the country at the same time , though , germany 's efforts failed to prevent war .
a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .
but the exact opposite is true , " he said . " where would we be today in the whole world - in africa , in crisis regions in the middle east , in the balkans - without the united nations . " pleuger also took positive stock of germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member , its fourth since the council came into existence .
" i believe that in these two years , germany tried to represent focused and constructive politics , " he said . he pointed to german efforts to draw international attention to sudan and darfur .
" they were forgotten conflicts for a long time , " pleuger said .
" we tried during our presidency in the security council in april to bring the topics on the agenda . " last week government sources in berlin underlined germany 's positive image in new york during its security council rotation .
" we were sometimes treated like one of the five permanent members , " a german government official told reporters . that might sound like wishful thinking , but pleuger is convinced that the painstaking legwork of the past two years at the un will eventually secure germany a permanent seat at the security council . german sights trained on un seat for months , the country has been vigorously lobbying around the world in an effort to win over two-thirds of the 191 un members to gain a seat at the decision-making table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany , at the un security council in new york .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has tirelessly pointed out that germany already shoulders ten percent of the security council budget and has proved , through its participation in several military and civil un missions , its readiness to take on responsibility . " naturally , there are many possibilities and procedural tricks to block reform in the united nations , " pleuger said referring to well-known italian reservations to germany getting a permanent seat and simmering us discontent at germany 's war opposition .

" it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .
the remaining ten are elected as non-permanent members for periods of two years . pleuger 's efforts to create an anti-war lobby resulted in a new self-confidence among the non-permanent members in the security council .
it also prevented the resolution authorizing war against iraq from getting a majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues in iraq long after the us invaded the country at the same time , though , germany 's efforts failed to prevent war .
a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .
but the exact opposite is true , " he said . " where would we be today in the whole world - in africa , in crisis regions in the middle east , in the balkans - without the united nations . " pleuger also took positive stock of germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member , its fourth since the council came into existence .
" i believe that in these two years , germany tried to represent focused and constructive politics , " he said . he pointed to german efforts to draw international attention to sudan and darfur .
" they were forgotten conflicts for a long time , " pleuger said .
" we tried during our presidency in the security council in april to bring the topics on the agenda . " last week government sources in berlin underlined germany 's positive image in new york during its security council rotation .
" we were sometimes treated like one of the five permanent members , " a german government official told reporters . that might sound like wishful thinking , but pleuger is convinced that the painstaking legwork of the past two years at the un will eventually secure germany a permanent seat at the security council . german sights trained on un seat for months , the country has been vigorously lobbying around the world in an effort to win over two-thirds of the 191 un members to gain a seat at the decision-making table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany , at the un security council in new york .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has tirelessly pointed out that germany already shoulders ten percent of the security council budget and has proved , through its participation in several military and civil un missions , its readiness to take on responsibility . " naturally , there are many possibilities and procedural tricks to block reform in the united nations , " pleuger said referring to well-known italian reservations to germany getting a permanent seat and simmering us discontent at germany 's war opposition .
" but we know the tricks too . " the seasoned un hand said . rainer sütfield -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us backing italy in security council row ?

31 .
despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive . germany 's entry into the powerful un security council on jan .
1 , 2003 , as a two-year non-permanent member came at a time when the un 's top decision-making body was engulfed in crisis . us president bush had hinted that america would consider bypassing the international body in its resolve to remove the threat posed by iraq through its alleged weapons of mass destruction . saying the united nations would " be irrelevant " if it did n't " move deliberately and decisively to hold iraq to account , " bush sought to move against saddam hussein , whom he described as a “ grave and gathering danger . ” a fine balancing act under the delicate diplomatic circumstances , germany 's representatives to the un were under additional pressure given that chancellor gerhard schröder was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led military campaign against iraq . caught between american and british insistence on a preemptive strike against iraq on the one hand and a pacifist german foreign policy on the other , germany 's un diplomats , who also took over the security council presidency during the crucial weeks before the invasion , had their job cut out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ambassador to the un gunter pleuger no one knows that better than günter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , who steps down at the end of 2004 as germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the security council draws to a close .
in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .
the remaining ten are elected as non-permanent members for periods of two years . pleuger 's efforts to create an anti-war lobby resulted in a new self-confidence among the non-permanent members in the security council .
it also prevented the resolution authorizing war against iraq from getting a majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence continues in iraq long after the us invaded the country at the same time , though , germany 's efforts failed to prevent war .
a deeply-divided security council was left to grapple with other hotspots around the world in africa and afghanistan . un still intact : pleuger pleuger , however , stressed that the un had lost none of its authority and significance .
" we heard two years ago that the un could possibly become irrelevant .
but the exact opposite is true , " he said . " where would we be today in the whole world - in africa , in crisis regions in the middle east , in the balkans - without the united nations . " pleuger also took positive stock of germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member , its fourth since the council came into existence .
" i believe that in these two years , germany tried to represent focused and constructive politics , " he said . he pointed to german efforts to draw international attention to sudan and darfur .
" they were forgotten conflicts for a long time , " pleuger said .
" we tried during our presidency in the security council in april to bring the topics on the agenda . " last week government sources in berlin underlined germany 's positive image in new york during its security council rotation .
" we were sometimes treated like one of the five permanent members , " a german government official told reporters . that might sound like wishful thinking , but pleuger is convinced that the painstaking legwork of the past two years at the un will eventually secure germany a permanent seat at the security council . german sights trained on un seat for months , the country has been vigorously lobbying around the world in an effort to win over two-thirds of the 191 un members to gain a seat at the decision-making table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , foreign minister of germany , at the un security council in new york .
german foreign minister joschka fischer has tirelessly pointed out that germany already shoulders ten percent of the security council budget and has proved , through its participation in several military and civil un missions , its readiness to take on responsibility . " naturally , there are many possibilities and procedural tricks to block reform in the united nations , " pleuger said referring to well-known italian reservations to germany getting a permanent seat and simmering us discontent at germany 's war opposition .
" but we know the tricks too . " the seasoned un hand said . rainer sütfield -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us backing italy in security council row ?

" i still remember the extent of vote rigging some five weeks ago , " green party parliamentarian winfried nachtwei said .
he spent sunday as an electoral observer in the ukrainian city of odessa .
he said that he had n't seen or heard of any kind of irregularities . " this time around , i myself and the osce colleagues i 've talked with are convinced that the election was carried out in a fair manner .
i 've not come across any irregularities , " nachtwei said . though there had been criticism that the ballot boxes were transparent , nachtwei did n't find it problematic .
he said it made it possible to rule out that ballot slips were in the boxes even before the vote started .
the secrecy of the vote was ensured since no one was watching as people cast their votes one by one , he said . intensify relations - now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko agreement has been widespread among german lawmakers that bilateral relations as well as relations between the european union and ukraine must now reach a higher level as soon as possible . " the european union is now called upon to put its promises into practice - promises it has made in recent weeks , " said opposition christian democratic foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble on monday .
" it needs to foster greater political and economic cooperation with ukraine with a view to increasing stability in the country .
the eu will have to put ukraine back on its foreign policy agenda , he adds , and not ignore it the way it did before the presidential election and the peaceful uprising of the people . " his party comrade friedbert pflueger added that ukraine should be given a clear european perspective by brussels .
ukraine is a european country by any standards , he said , and it therefore deserved at least the same amount of attention by the european union as turkey , with which the bloc of 25 members has only just decided to start accession talks .
" yushchenko knows what to do " social democratic parliamentarian gert weisskirchen called the re-run of the election in ukraine a victory for civil society there and applauded the ukrainian people for their commitment to basic rights and for the courage and steadfastness they had displayed in recent weeks .
he said he hoped viktor yushchenko , as the obvious winner of the election , would use his past experience to embark on a political course which would suit both the eu and russia . " as prime minister or head of the ukrainian national bank , mr yushchenko was well aware of his country 's interests and defended them well , " weisskirchen said .
" in so doing , he looked to the european union and to russia at the same time without having to embark on a collision course with either of the two .
in other words , he 'll continue to seek good relations both to moscow and brussels . " weisskirchen also expressed the hope that the president-designate would have enough political clout to overcome the strong polarization in ukrainian society and take his opponent viktor yanukovych 's followers on-board on the road towards more political stability and economic development . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

in a recent interview with german public broadcaster ndr , pleuger admitted that the iraq issue had undoubtedly dominated germany 's two-year term . " that was a discussion that was conducted with great verve but also with great seriousness , " pleuger said .
" that 's because all members were aware of the fact that we were dealing with war and peace , that it was the credibility of the united nations and the security council that was at stake . " leading the anti-war camp at the time , pleuger , a trained lawyer and political scientist who has represented germany at the un since 2002 , was credited with mobilizing the ten non-permanent members of the security council and war opponents and urging them to speak with a single voice on the issue of iraq much to the displeasure of the americans . " it was just the simple idea that the ten elected members should also feel needed , " pleuger said .
" especially when it comes to taking a decision -lrb- in the security council -rrb- because for that , nine out of those 15 voices are needed . " the 15-member security council has five permanent members with veto rights : china , france , russia , the united states and the united kingdom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.12.2004 " bio food " goes big in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looks just like the regular grocery store organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent . germany is a country of discount supermarkets : chains such as aldi , lidl or plus attract customers who want as much as possible for as little as possible .
but more and more discerning customers are turning away from such thinking and instead are looking for organic quality . stores with names such as " basic , " " eat organic " and " supernatural " are sprouting up across germany to fill the niche .
while at first sight they look like regular supermarkets , they 're actually quite different : the design 's a little more tasteful , shop assistants seem friendlier and the tomatoes appear a touch juicier than in other places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agricultural and consumer protection minister renate künast poses in front of organic food products at a organic food trade fair such " bio supermarkets " now exist in most german cities and represent the next generation of organic food stores , according to christoph spahn , a consultant for health food stores .
compared to old-fashioned organic food stores , bio supermarkets have much larger self-service sections , he said , adding that people who work there still know what they 're talking about . " i can still ask them about something and they 'll be able to give me expert advice , " he said . dried-up carrots vs. hedonism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small organic food store in germany for years , many germans associated dried-up carrots and canvas shopping bags with organic food stores .
most people avoided such shops because they were considered more expensive than the regular supermarkets .
they derided organic food lovers , who bought their tofu and musli in health food stores . that 's changed , according to spahn . " there 's much fewer classic organic food buyers than before , " he said , adding that stores have also shifted from an orientation towards families to a more hedonistic audience . just like their customers , health food stores have also changed appearance .
the stores are larger now and more of them - more than 200 now exist nation-wide .
they lure customers by saying that they sell products for less than other organic stores and seem to be successful with this strategy . growing trend according to spahn , about one fifth of revenues in the organic food sector now comes from " bio supermarkets , " and the consultant said he believes this trend will continue .
spahn expects revenues from organic supermarkets to double in the coming years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some regular german supermarkets have also started selling organic foods , such as bananas .
others said health food supermarkets are also more in line with lifestyle trends .
andrew murphy , the chief executive of supernatural , a chain that runs five organic supermarkets in germany 's rhineland region , said the demand remains greater than what 's on offer . " people are sick and tired of eating products that taste like baby food , " he said . " during the last couple of years , people have been told that ' stinginess is cool , " ' murphy added , referring to the popular advertising slogan of an german electronics supermarket .

berlin hails ukrainian decision ; russia slams west yushchenko poisoned , doctors say court orders new ukrainian election europe -pipe- 27.12.2004 opinion : democracy triumphs in ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians have high expectations of president-elect yushchenko with over 95 percent of votes counted , pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko won the ukrainian presidential election .
dw 's ute schaeffer assessed the task he faces . ukraine 's next president is viktor yushchenko .
the political change the west hoped for and the ukrainians demanded has happened .
and it has been legitimized by a free and fair election .
but the real work has yet to be done .
creating a democracy and the rule of law will require more time and be significantly more cumbersome than re-staging the ballot . the campaign was n't about personalities or even election platforms over the past few weeks .
it was a contest between an overly powerful state that pulled all the stops to put " its " candidate in office against a democratically oriented public , courageous students , protesting journalists , critical businesspeople . they triumphed .
democracy triumphed .
now , democracy must be established at all levels of government and business .
it 's a formidable task . the voters gave viktor yushchenko a clear mandate : more democracy and genuine life prospects .
yushchenko is supposed to quickly improve the standard of living - in the countryside , too - and ensure that pensions and stipends are both regularly paid and increased .
daunting work ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko the meshwork of political and business interests will be more complicated to deal with .
yushchenko will have to maneuver cleverly , since the competing groups that have very profitably split up politics , business and the mass media between themselves pursue quite different aims .
none of them will be willing to cede power . yushchenko will have to fight the corruption and cronyism that pervade ukrainian politics , business and society - a task that cost him his job as prime minister in 2001 .
the issue is implementing efficient economic policies whose profits do n't only benefit a select few , but rather as tax money paying into social costs and developing the infrastructure .
it 's a matter of drastically modernizing industry and business so ukraine can sell its products better .
and , not least , it 's about a multifaceted foreign policy upon which ukraine , with its many borders , is existentially dependent . yushchenko can gauge what will be expected of him .
he has asserted his position in ukraine 's political system with its numerous groups and knows how to cater to the differing political interests .
thus , many people say he lacks the political leadership qualities .
on the other hand , the only way to survive in ukraine 's fractured political spectrum is to find a balance and bring all parties together . more than words required of europe so far europe has offered ukraine little more than warm words .
now is the time for the western neighbors to finally turn towards ukraine .
the political change that was ushered in by the election does n't merely need time , it also needs active support from outside . a politically stable , peaceful and democratic ukraine means more security for europe .
that 's why brussels and berlin should n't disregard the opportunities that arise from the election result . ute schaeffer -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine election challenged again opposition leader viktor yushchenko won ukraine 's presidency monday after a historic election in which he vowed to steer the strategic ex-soviet nation on a new course toward the west and away from russia .

they lure customers by saying that they sell products for less than other organic stores and seem to be successful with this strategy . growing trend according to spahn , about one fifth of revenues in the organic food sector now comes from " bio supermarkets , " and the consultant said he believes this trend will continue .

tourism operators thomas cook , rewe , pauschaltouristik , meier 's weltreisen and dertour have cancelled flights to the worst hit areas .
instead , many companies have been flying empty planes to the crisis-struck region to bring tourists back to europe .
the first plane of erstwhile holidaymakers returned on monday morning to germany on a thai airways flight from phuket and bangkok to frankfurt am main . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai soldiers sit in front of empty coffins to be transported to phuket at bangkok military airport on monday thailand has escaped relatively lightly compared to the calamitous tolls in sri lanka and indonesia .
but as southeast asia 's busiest tourist destination , with 12 million foreign visits expected this year , it is undergoing a herculean tourist evacuation .
hundreds of rescue ships , helicopters and planes have been mobilized to move foreign visitors , estimated by a tourism official as topping 100,000 , who had packed into southern thailand 's famed resorts for christmas and new year . thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra , overseeing the rescue operations , vowed to fly any foreign visitor in need back to his or her country free of charge .
" any tourists who wanted to leave thailand , we will issue a certificate of identification to use as their passports and thailand will pay all expenses . " an emergency services director for thai airways said the government was encouraging all foreign tourists to leave southern thailand and return to bangkok or their home countries .
beach holidays in sri lanka , where at least 70 foreign tourists have died , dozens of german and british vacationers who survived tidal waves moved to a makeshift refugee center before cutting short their holidays and leaving , as the island 's official death toll climbed to well over 5,000 . bildunterschrift : a map of the countries affected by the quake bruised and shaken , men and women huddled at a conference center where tour operators set up desks to arrange for the evacuation of the tourists .
" we have never experienced anything like this before , " briton ken babb told afp .
" this is not an adventure .
this is a disaster . " tourist melony maas , one of thousands of germans said to be holidaying on the beach , said she and her mother wanted to help the sri lankan staff at their hotel after the first tidal wave , but the staff insisted they leave .
" i can not describe how i feel , " maas said as she awaited a flight home . " this is very sad for the sri lankan people .
a lot of poor people have died . " " this is my second visit to sri lanka .
what i want now is to get back , but i will come again , " she vowed . and indeed for the majority of tourists who were able to flee the region , the catastrophe will leave little more than negative memories .
for the hundreds of thousands of people who call the region home , the work of caring for families and friends , rebuilding houses and businesses and securing drinking water and medical supplies has just begun .

the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- is calling for an " assault on the failings of the education system " .
it says too many of england 's school leavers can not read or write or do arithmetic properly .
the government insists much progress has been made in improving basic skills since the introduction of strategies on literacy and numeracy .
but the cbi 's director general , digby jones , said : " my fear is that many who can not read , write or add up properly will find themselves unemployable - and the problem is only going to worsen .
" this is a scandal , but it is not a new scandal .
it 's not a problem that has been created by this government .
indeed , ministers have done a lot to chip away at the problem since 1997 .
" but let 's be honest , no political party has cracked this one . "
bigger progress his organisation said it was poor that only about one in two school leavers in england achieved gcse maths or english qualifications at grade c or above .
the government suggests the claims are unfair .
a spokesman for the department for education and skills said the recent international trends in international mathematics and science study -lrb- timss -rrb- reported that primary school pupils had made bigger progress in maths than those in any other country .
" this summer 's results for 14-year-olds also showed that we are making good progress in raising standards in the core subjects of english and maths for 14-year-olds . "
under proposals put forward by mike tomlinson for a shake-up of the education system for 14 to 19-year-olds in england , all school-leavers would be required to take a " core skills " test .
this would cover literacy , maths and information and communication technology .
the government is due to respond to mr tomlinson 's proposals in the new year .

it says too many of england 's school leavers can not read or write or do arithmetic properly .
