germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .
29 . reliable assurances needed gernot erler , a deputy parliamentary leader of the governing social democrats , said he did n't expect a decision until march .
" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
a welcome move it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .
an influential thinker the opening date of the new office was picked deliberately to tie in with memorial celebrations for the world-famous philosopher , a personal favorite of joschka fischer 's .
the german foreign minister has described kant as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
his 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant as a cultural bridge kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
a german territory for hundreds of years , kaliningrad has been in russian hands for less than 60 .
the struggling enclave served as a major military base during the cold war after it was divided between russia and poland following world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not surprisingly , it 's a region caught uncomfortably between russia and the new european world that surrounds it .
much of the population is increasingly western in its thinking - and once its neighbors lithuania and poland join the eu in may , some fear the enclave could slowly become culturally estranged from russia .
after a bitter row between moscow and brussels over what president putin saw as a breach of russian sovereignty , the eu and russia reached an agreement in 2002 on travel rules for kaliningrad residents , which will allow them to travel through the new schengen zone countries to mainland russia with a document obtained at the border rather than a formal visa .
but the presence of germany 's new consulate general in kaliningrad could help to smooth out ruffled feathers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .

a welcome move it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .
an influential thinker the opening date of the new office was picked deliberately to tie in with memorial celebrations for the world-famous philosopher , a personal favorite of joschka fischer 's .
the german foreign minister has described kant as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
his 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant as a cultural bridge kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
a german territory for hundreds of years , kaliningrad has been in russian hands for less than 60 .
the struggling enclave served as a major military base during the cold war after it was divided between russia and poland following world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not surprisingly , it 's a region caught uncomfortably between russia and the new european world that surrounds it .
much of the population is increasingly western in its thinking - and once its neighbors lithuania and poland join the eu in may , some fear the enclave could slowly become culturally estranged from russia .
after a bitter row between moscow and brussels over what president putin saw as a breach of russian sovereignty , the eu and russia reached an agreement in 2002 on travel rules for kaliningrad residents , which will allow them to travel through the new schengen zone countries to mainland russia with a document obtained at the border rather than a formal visa .
but the presence of germany 's new consulate general in kaliningrad could help to smooth out ruffled feathers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .

dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .

in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.02.2004 fischer establishes german outpost in kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaliningrad will be landlocked by the eu , including lithuania whose border is picture here , as of may 1 .
after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .
the german foreign minister has described kant -lrb- image -rrb- as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
in honor of the philosopher , fischer placed a wreath over his grave on thursday . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age two hundred years after his death in königsberg -lrb- today the russian enclave of kaliningrad -rrb- , immanuel kant 's writings continue to influence the way people think .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .
the german foreign minister has described kant -lrb- image -rrb- as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .
if , on the other hand , no one took that given action and as a result civilization was destroyed , then that behavior is morally obligatory . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age .

it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .
the german foreign minister has described kant -lrb- image -rrb- as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
in honor of the philosopher , fischer placed a wreath over his grave on thursday . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age two hundred years after his death in königsberg -lrb- today the russian enclave of kaliningrad -rrb- , immanuel kant 's writings continue to influence the way people think .

air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .
the merger should be completed in the summer . a combined klm-air france will fly past american airlines and united airlines , both based in the united states , in terms of passanger traffic to rank number one in the world . it will also take off ahead of japan airlines system corp. as the largest airlines group in revenue . as a result , the european commission in brussels approved the deal on wednesday only under strict conditions .
the merged airlines have to give up several routes from the netherlands to france and also transatlantic routes from amsterdam to atlanta and new york and from paris to detroit . the two companies ' chief executive officers surrendered nearly a hundred slots for takeoff and landing at european airports .

the big airlines , many of them partly state-owned , feel pressure from 40 low-budget-carriers that popped up like mushrooms all over the eu in recent years . u.s. authorities also approved the deal despite concerns that klm 's already existing alliance with north-west-airlines would harm competition with delta airlines .
but since the u.s. carrier is bundled with air france and north-west and delta would be in one airline family under the sky-team-alliance headed currently by air france , the american officials agreed to the merger . stock markets welcomed the deal .
air france und klm shares jumped on tuesday .
last september , air france announced it would buy klm through a share exchange of € 784 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .
the merger should be completed in the summer . a combined klm-air france will fly past american airlines and united airlines , both based in the united states , in terms of passanger traffic to rank number one in the world . it will also take off ahead of japan airlines system corp. as the largest airlines group in revenue . as a result , the european commission in brussels approved the deal on wednesday only under strict conditions .
the merged airlines have to give up several routes from the netherlands to france and also transatlantic routes from amsterdam to atlanta and new york and from paris to detroit . the two companies ' chief executive officers surrendered nearly a hundred slots for takeoff and landing at european airports .
" this will enable rival airlines to start a service where competition would have been eliminated or significantly reduced , " the european commission said in a statement , according to reuters news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti air france boss jean-cyril spinetta and klm chairman leo van wijk had lobbied hard to strike the deal .
as recently as monday they had a lengthy discussion with the eu commissioner handling mergers , mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- . more weddings on the horizon monti is also likely to give his green light for a close partnership between air france and italy 's major carrier , alitalia .
monti , who has always approached the merger talks positively , regards consolidation in the european market as necessary .
as a result , more weddings might follow soon , say analysts .
today the european aviation sector is still organized alongside national borders and not economic needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair , left , bought buzz airline from klm last year .
the big airlines , many of them partly state-owned , feel pressure from 40 low-budget-carriers that popped up like mushrooms all over the eu in recent years . u.s. authorities also approved the deal despite concerns that klm 's already existing alliance with north-west-airlines would harm competition with delta airlines .
but since the u.s. carrier is bundled with air france and north-west and delta would be in one airline family under the sky-team-alliance headed currently by air france , the american officials agreed to the merger . stock markets welcomed the deal .
air france und klm shares jumped on tuesday .
last september , air france announced it would buy klm through a share exchange of € 784 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- .
both companies will retain their brands and hub airports once the merger is fully completed in the summer . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air france and klm to form huge new alliance a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .
i do n't see any major pay disputes arising in the construction and chemical sectors now . " the deal will also likely give ig metall 's boss peters some breathing space .
if the pay dispute had escalated into a messy labor battle , the beleaguered peters could have faced ouster at the head of germany 's largest manufacturing trade union after lead ig metall into a failed strike last summer in a vain attempt to shorten the workweek in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours at a time when many in the former communist east were unemployed . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt the old school leftist peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall 's future hinges on wage talks with a failed strike , internecine power struggles behind it and eroding membership , ig metall 's contentious wage negotiations this year could determine the union ’ s future – and whether it has one .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .

kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.02.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc berlin wall guards found guilty of manslaughter the last case involving the deaths of east germans who were killed as they attempted to escape over the berlin wall has come to a close .
on thursday , a berlin court found a former east german guard guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to 21 months on probation .
his former deputy was found guilty of aiding in the crimes and sentenced to 12 months on probation .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .
if , on the other hand , no one took that given action and as a result civilization was destroyed , then that behavior is morally obligatory . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age .

the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .
if , on the other hand , no one took that given action and as a result civilization was destroyed , then that behavior is morally obligatory . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .

i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
a welcome move it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .
an influential thinker the opening date of the new office was picked deliberately to tie in with memorial celebrations for the world-famous philosopher , a personal favorite of joschka fischer 's .
the german foreign minister has described kant as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
his 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant as a cultural bridge kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
a german territory for hundreds of years , kaliningrad has been in russian hands for less than 60 .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .
i do n't see any major pay disputes arising in the construction and chemical sectors now . " the deal will also likely give ig metall 's boss peters some breathing space .
if the pay dispute had escalated into a messy labor battle , the beleaguered peters could have faced ouster at the head of germany 's largest manufacturing trade union after lead ig metall into a failed strike last summer in a vain attempt to shorten the workweek in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours at a time when many in the former communist east were unemployed . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt the old school leftist peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall 's future hinges on wage talks with a failed strike , internecine power struggles behind it and eroding membership , ig metall 's contentious wage negotiations this year could determine the union ’ s future – and whether it has one .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .
29 . reliable assurances needed gernot erler , a deputy parliamentary leader of the governing social democrats , said he did n't expect a decision until march .
" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .

" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

agents would no longer be able to retain part of the ticket price as a commission and would , instead , have to start charging their customers service fees .
now it appears germany 's largest travel agencies are breaking ranks , including tui , which signaled on thursday that it would sign the new contracts with lufthansa by saturday .
according to a company spokesman , tui does not plan to participate in the boycott planned for monday through friday of next week .
all the same , germany 's smaller travel agencies are still planning to proceed with the protest . more briefs 12.02.2004 -pipe- clement reports on the german economy 12.02.2004 -pipe- germans biggest consumers of bioproducts in europe 11.02.2004 -pipe- deutsche 's ackermann defends mannesmann bonuses 11.02.2004 -pipe- german cigarette price hike in march 11.02.2004 -pipe- social democrats mull minimum pension 11.02.2004 -pipe- economist calls german unification an economic disaster 11.02.2004 -pipe- deutsche bank under investigation in parmalat case 10.02.2004 -pipe- spd calls for changes in schröder 's reform plans radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .

" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .
i do n't see any major pay disputes arising in the construction and chemical sectors now . " the deal will also likely give ig metall 's boss peters some breathing space .
if the pay dispute had escalated into a messy labor battle , the beleaguered peters could have faced ouster at the head of germany 's largest manufacturing trade union after lead ig metall into a failed strike last summer in a vain attempt to shorten the workweek in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours at a time when many in the former communist east were unemployed . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt the old school leftist peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall 's future hinges on wage talks with a failed strike , internecine power struggles behind it and eroding membership , ig metall 's contentious wage negotiations this year could determine the union ’ s future – and whether it has one .

right up next to hegel and marx , kant is one of germany 's - if not the world 's - most famous thinkers .
two hundred years after his death in königsberg -lrb- today the russian enclave of kaliningrad -rrb- immanuel kant 's writings continue to influence the way people think .
even if his works such as the critique of pure reason and groundwork for the metaphysics of morals seem dauntingly complex to the majority of readers , kant 's notions of a " categorical imperative " as the ultimate responsibility of the human will still form the basis for much of contemporary discussion on politics and ethics .
dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age . dw-world.de " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics .
kant : introducing ideas for a new age hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
a welcome move it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .
an influential thinker the opening date of the new office was picked deliberately to tie in with memorial celebrations for the world-famous philosopher , a personal favorite of joschka fischer 's .
the german foreign minister has described kant as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
his 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant as a cultural bridge kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
a german territory for hundreds of years , kaliningrad has been in russian hands for less than 60 .
the struggling enclave served as a major military base during the cold war after it was divided between russia and poland following world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not surprisingly , it 's a region caught uncomfortably between russia and the new european world that surrounds it .
much of the population is increasingly western in its thinking - and once its neighbors lithuania and poland join the eu in may , some fear the enclave could slowly become culturally estranged from russia .
after a bitter row between moscow and brussels over what president putin saw as a breach of russian sovereignty , the eu and russia reached an agreement in 2002 on travel rules for kaliningrad residents , which will allow them to travel through the new schengen zone countries to mainland russia with a document obtained at the border rather than a formal visa .
but the presence of germany 's new consulate general in kaliningrad could help to smooth out ruffled feathers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .
i do n't see any major pay disputes arising in the construction and chemical sectors now . " the deal will also likely give ig metall 's boss peters some breathing space .
if the pay dispute had escalated into a messy labor battle , the beleaguered peters could have faced ouster at the head of germany 's largest manufacturing trade union after lead ig metall into a failed strike last summer in a vain attempt to shorten the workweek in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours at a time when many in the former communist east were unemployed . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt the old school leftist peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall 's future hinges on wage talks with a failed strike , internecine power struggles behind it and eroding membership , ig metall 's contentious wage negotiations this year could determine the union ’ s future – and whether it has one .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a philosopher for the modern age kant : introducing ideas for a new age the categorical imperative kant serves as a cultural bridge culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.02.2004 " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant continues to influence modern politics .
february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .
the german foreign minister has described kant -lrb- image -rrb- as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "

kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .
an influential thinker the opening date of the new office was picked deliberately to tie in with memorial celebrations for the world-famous philosopher , a personal favorite of joschka fischer 's .
the german foreign minister has described kant as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
his 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant as a cultural bridge kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
a german territory for hundreds of years , kaliningrad has been in russian hands for less than 60 .
the struggling enclave served as a major military base during the cold war after it was divided between russia and poland following world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not surprisingly , it 's a region caught uncomfortably between russia and the new european world that surrounds it .
much of the population is increasingly western in its thinking - and once its neighbors lithuania and poland join the eu in may , some fear the enclave could slowly become culturally estranged from russia .
after a bitter row between moscow and brussels over what president putin saw as a breach of russian sovereignty , the eu and russia reached an agreement in 2002 on travel rules for kaliningrad residents , which will allow them to travel through the new schengen zone countries to mainland russia with a document obtained at the border rather than a formal visa .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .
if , on the other hand , no one took that given action and as a result civilization was destroyed , then that behavior is morally obligatory . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .
the merger should be completed in the summer . a combined klm-air france will fly past american airlines and united airlines , both based in the united states , in terms of passanger traffic to rank number one in the world . it will also take off ahead of japan airlines system corp. as the largest airlines group in revenue . as a result , the european commission in brussels approved the deal on wednesday only under strict conditions .
the merged airlines have to give up several routes from the netherlands to france and also transatlantic routes from amsterdam to atlanta and new york and from paris to detroit . the two companies ' chief executive officers surrendered nearly a hundred slots for takeoff and landing at european airports .
" this will enable rival airlines to start a service where competition would have been eliminated or significantly reduced , " the european commission said in a statement , according to reuters news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti air france boss jean-cyril spinetta and klm chairman leo van wijk had lobbied hard to strike the deal .
as recently as monday they had a lengthy discussion with the eu commissioner handling mergers , mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- . more weddings on the horizon monti is also likely to give his green light for a close partnership between air france and italy 's major carrier , alitalia .
monti , who has always approached the merger talks positively , regards consolidation in the european market as necessary .
as a result , more weddings might follow soon , say analysts .
today the european aviation sector is still organized alongside national borders and not economic needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair , left , bought buzz airline from klm last year .
the big airlines , many of them partly state-owned , feel pressure from 40 low-budget-carriers that popped up like mushrooms all over the eu in recent years . u.s. authorities also approved the deal despite concerns that klm 's already existing alliance with north-west-airlines would harm competition with delta airlines .
but since the u.s. carrier is bundled with air france and north-west and delta would be in one airline family under the sky-team-alliance headed currently by air france , the american officials agreed to the merger . stock markets welcomed the deal .
air france und klm shares jumped on tuesday .
last september , air france announced it would buy klm through a share exchange of € 784 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- .
both companies will retain their brands and hub airports once the merger is fully completed in the summer . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air france and klm to form huge new alliance a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .

the big airlines , many of them partly state-owned , feel pressure from 40 low-budget-carriers that popped up like mushrooms all over the eu in recent years . u.s. authorities also approved the deal despite concerns that klm 's already existing alliance with north-west-airlines would harm competition with delta airlines .
but since the u.s. carrier is bundled with air france and north-west and delta would be in one airline family under the sky-team-alliance headed currently by air france , the american officials agreed to the merger . stock markets welcomed the deal .
air france und klm shares jumped on tuesday .
last september , air france announced it would buy klm through a share exchange of € 784 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .

after a bitter row between moscow and brussels over what president putin saw as a breach of russian sovereignty , the eu and russia reached an agreement in 2002 on travel rules for kaliningrad residents , which will allow them to travel through the new schengen zone countries to mainland russia with a document obtained at the border rather than a formal visa .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .
if , on the other hand , no one took that given action and as a result civilization was destroyed , then that behavior is morally obligatory . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .

kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .
29 . reliable assurances needed gernot erler , a deputy parliamentary leader of the governing social democrats , said he did n't expect a decision until march .
" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .

" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a philosopher for the modern age " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " the categorical imperative kant serves as a cultural bridge culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.02.2004 kant : introducing ideas for a new age großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant died on feb .
12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

right up next to hegel and marx , kant is one of germany 's - if not the world 's - most famous thinkers .
two hundred years after his death in königsberg -lrb- today the russian enclave of kaliningrad -rrb- immanuel kant 's writings continue to influence the way people think .
even if his works such as the critique of pure reason and groundwork for the metaphysics of morals seem dauntingly complex to the majority of readers , kant 's notions of a " categorical imperative " as the ultimate responsibility of the human will still form the basis for much of contemporary discussion on politics and ethics .
dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age . dw-world.de " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics .
kant : introducing ideas for a new age hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death .
kant serves as a cultural bridge german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .
29 . reliable assurances needed gernot erler , a deputy parliamentary leader of the governing social democrats , said he did n't expect a decision until march .
" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .
29 . reliable assurances needed gernot erler , a deputy parliamentary leader of the governing social democrats , said he did n't expect a decision until march .
" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .

" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
a welcome move it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .
an influential thinker the opening date of the new office was picked deliberately to tie in with memorial celebrations for the world-famous philosopher , a personal favorite of joschka fischer 's .
the german foreign minister has described kant as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
his 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant as a cultural bridge kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
a german territory for hundreds of years , kaliningrad has been in russian hands for less than 60 .
the struggling enclave served as a major military base during the cold war after it was divided between russia and poland following world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not surprisingly , it 's a region caught uncomfortably between russia and the new european world that surrounds it .
much of the population is increasingly western in its thinking - and once its neighbors lithuania and poland join the eu in may , some fear the enclave could slowly become culturally estranged from russia .
after a bitter row between moscow and brussels over what president putin saw as a breach of russian sovereignty , the eu and russia reached an agreement in 2002 on travel rules for kaliningrad residents , which will allow them to travel through the new schengen zone countries to mainland russia with a document obtained at the border rather than a formal visa .
but the presence of germany 's new consulate general in kaliningrad could help to smooth out ruffled feathers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .

the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .
the german foreign minister has described kant -lrb- image -rrb- as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
in honor of the philosopher , fischer placed a wreath over his grave on thursday . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age two hundred years after his death in königsberg -lrb- today the russian enclave of kaliningrad -rrb- , immanuel kant 's writings continue to influence the way people think .

the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .
the german foreign minister has described kant -lrb- image -rrb- as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .

air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .
the merger should be completed in the summer . a combined klm-air france will fly past american airlines and united airlines , both based in the united states , in terms of passanger traffic to rank number one in the world . it will also take off ahead of japan airlines system corp. as the largest airlines group in revenue . as a result , the european commission in brussels approved the deal on wednesday only under strict conditions .
the merged airlines have to give up several routes from the netherlands to france and also transatlantic routes from amsterdam to atlanta and new york and from paris to detroit . the two companies ' chief executive officers surrendered nearly a hundred slots for takeoff and landing at european airports .
" this will enable rival airlines to start a service where competition would have been eliminated or significantly reduced , " the european commission said in a statement , according to reuters news service . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for competition mario monti air france boss jean-cyril spinetta and klm chairman leo van wijk had lobbied hard to strike the deal .
as recently as monday they had a lengthy discussion with the eu commissioner handling mergers , mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- . more weddings on the horizon monti is also likely to give his green light for a close partnership between air france and italy 's major carrier , alitalia .
monti , who has always approached the merger talks positively , regards consolidation in the european market as necessary .
as a result , more weddings might follow soon , say analysts .
today the european aviation sector is still organized alongside national borders and not economic needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryanair , left , bought buzz airline from klm last year .
the big airlines , many of them partly state-owned , feel pressure from 40 low-budget-carriers that popped up like mushrooms all over the eu in recent years . u.s. authorities also approved the deal despite concerns that klm 's already existing alliance with north-west-airlines would harm competition with delta airlines .
but since the u.s. carrier is bundled with air france and north-west and delta would be in one airline family under the sky-team-alliance headed currently by air france , the american officials agreed to the merger . stock markets welcomed the deal .
air france und klm shares jumped on tuesday .
last september , air france announced it would buy klm through a share exchange of € 784 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- .
both companies will retain their brands and hub airports once the merger is fully completed in the summer . bernd riegert -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de air france and klm to form huge new alliance a deal between air france and dutch carrier klm could create create europe 's biggest airline and one of the world ’ s largest carriers .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
a welcome move it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a philosopher for the modern age " kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age " kant serves as a cultural bridge kant : introducing ideas for a new age culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.02.2004 the categorical imperative kant 's philosophy introduces a set of maxims by which individuals can use reason to determine whether or not their behavior is moral . the categorical imperative is the founding principle of kant 's moral philosophy .
it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
a welcome move it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
a home for the consulate general has yet to be found .
for the time being , the diplomatic team will work from the hotel albertina , situated in a newly affluent district on the northern outskirts of the city .
an influential thinker the opening date of the new office was picked deliberately to tie in with memorial celebrations for the world-famous philosopher , a personal favorite of joschka fischer 's .
the german foreign minister has described kant as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
his 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant as a cultural bridge kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .
a german territory for hundreds of years , kaliningrad has been in russian hands for less than 60 .
the struggling enclave served as a major military base during the cold war after it was divided between russia and poland following world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not surprisingly , it 's a region caught uncomfortably between russia and the new european world that surrounds it .
much of the population is increasingly western in its thinking - and once its neighbors lithuania and poland join the eu in may , some fear the enclave could slowly become culturally estranged from russia .
after a bitter row between moscow and brussels over what president putin saw as a breach of russian sovereignty , the eu and russia reached an agreement in 2002 on travel rules for kaliningrad residents , which will allow them to travel through the new schengen zone countries to mainland russia with a document obtained at the border rather than a formal visa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.02.2004 fischer establishes german outpost in kaliningrad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaliningrad will be landlocked by the eu , including lithuania whose border is picture here , as of may 1 .
after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .

" the chinese have to give us reliable assurances to render our concerns irrelevant , " erler told financial times deutschland . german industrial giant siemens had asked the government to grant permission for the sale of the disassembled plant in hanau near frankfurt last year .
the plan emerged during german chancellor gerhard schröder 's december trip to china and provoked outrage among nuclear energy opponents .
the german government , which has begun phasing out nuclear energy at home , said it will approve the sale unless concerns about military use can not be eliminated . the european union still has an arms embargo against china in place , but schröder and french president jacques chirac have come out in support of scrapping it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german minister says siemens should scrap nuclear export german environment minister trittin has weighed in on the debate over berlin 's mired sale of a plutonium factory to china and warned plant owner siemens it risks damaging its image if it goes ahead with the export .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.02.2004 union and employers agree to wage deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal will avert a widespread labor dispute .
germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .
i do n't see any major pay disputes arising in the construction and chemical sectors now . " the deal will also likely give ig metall 's boss peters some breathing space .
if the pay dispute had escalated into a messy labor battle , the beleaguered peters could have faced ouster at the head of germany 's largest manufacturing trade union after lead ig metall into a failed strike last summer in a vain attempt to shorten the workweek in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours at a time when many in the former communist east were unemployed . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt the old school leftist peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall 's future hinges on wage talks with a failed strike , internecine power struggles behind it and eroding membership , ig metall 's contentious wage negotiations this year could determine the union ’ s future – and whether it has one .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .
i do n't see any major pay disputes arising in the construction and chemical sectors now . " the deal will also likely give ig metall 's boss peters some breathing space .
if the pay dispute had escalated into a messy labor battle , the beleaguered peters could have faced ouster at the head of germany 's largest manufacturing trade union after lead ig metall into a failed strike last summer in a vain attempt to shorten the workweek in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours at a time when many in the former communist east were unemployed . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt the old school leftist peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall 's future hinges on wage talks with a failed strike , internecine power struggles behind it and eroding membership , ig metall 's contentious wage negotiations this year could determine the union ’ s future – and whether it has one .

air france and royal dutch airlines -lrb- klm -rrb- will become the world 's largest airline in terms of revenue after european and u.s. authorities approved the deal .
the merger should be completed in the summer . a combined klm-air france will fly past american airlines and united airlines , both based in the united states , in terms of passanger traffic to rank number one in the world . it will also take off ahead of japan airlines system corp. as the largest airlines group in revenue . as a result , the european commission in brussels approved the deal on wednesday only under strict conditions .
the merged airlines have to give up several routes from the netherlands to france and also transatlantic routes from amsterdam to atlanta and new york and from paris to detroit . the two companies ' chief executive officers surrendered nearly a hundred slots for takeoff and landing at european airports .

as recently as monday they had a lengthy discussion with the eu commissioner handling mergers , mario monti -lrb- photo -rrb- . more weddings on the horizon monti is also likely to give his green light for a close partnership between air france and italy 's major carrier , alitalia .
monti , who has always approached the merger talks positively , regards consolidation in the european market as necessary .

the big airlines , many of them partly state-owned , feel pressure from 40 low-budget-carriers that popped up like mushrooms all over the eu in recent years . u.s. authorities also approved the deal despite concerns that klm 's already existing alliance with north-west-airlines would harm competition with delta airlines .
but since the u.s. carrier is bundled with air france and north-west and delta would be in one airline family under the sky-team-alliance headed currently by air france , the american officials agreed to the merger . stock markets welcomed the deal .
air france und klm shares jumped on tuesday .
last september , air france announced it would buy klm through a share exchange of € 784 million -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .
" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .
after opening the consulate , fischer traveled on to moscow , where he is expected to meet with russian foreign minister igor ivanov and president vladimir putin at the kremlin .
he is expected to discuss the latest developments in iraq and the international war on terrorism before returning to berlin late thursday night . kant as a cultural bridge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant fischer chose thursday to open the consulate because it marks the 200th anniversary of the death of the german philosopher immanuel kant , who lived and died in the east prussian trading city .
the german foreign minister has described kant -lrb- image -rrb- as a major influence on his own political development , and a thinker whose theories helped shape contemporary politics .
kant 's 1795 essay " perpetual peace " explored the idea of a world federation of republican states , providing a blueprint for today 's concept of the united nations .
kant is also seen by many as a bridge between germany and kaliningrad , and a symbol of the russian city 's german past , when the city played a significant role as a port and center of academic excellence .

" i hope that will soon also be the case in the area of goods transport , so that we can create the conditions for a successful , cross-border cooperation between the european union and kaliningrad . "
up until now , residents of kaliningrad had to travel to moscow in order to get a travel visa to visit western european countries that are part of the schengen open borders agreement , but once the consulate is up and running , they will be able to take care of visa applications at the german post .
long delays plans for a kaliningrad consulate have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns - mostly among nationalists and communists - that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .
in 1994 , then-president boris yeltsin put a perfunctory stop to the venture , citing " considerable resistance from parliament and sections of the public . "
along with the german embassy in moscow , germany has consulate generals in st. petersburg , saratov and novosibirsk .
it was only in 2003 that president putin and german chancellor schröder dusted off the project and agreed to open a german consulate general in the russian enclave - the main impetus being the eu 's imminent eastward expansion , which will leave kaliningrad geographically isolated from russia .
kaliningrad governor valdimir jegerov welcomed the move , saying , " it 's an important signal that our concerns are being taken seriously in the european union , " and adding that " more german businesses may now take the opportunity to invest in kaliningrad . "
cornelius sommer , who has been appointed as consul general , is still searching for a home for the german diplomatic representation .
he is currently residing in a hotel .
however , the government is planning to open a visa department by summer .

after 65 years of absence , the german government appointed its first official diplomat to the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the former prussian city has belonged to russia since world war ii . describing the step as a " sign of confidence " of the determination of germany and russia to forge a common future , german foreign minister joschka fischer opened his country 's first diplomatic outpost in the russian enclave of kaliningrad on thursday .
the events celebrating the posting of germany 's first consul general also marked fischer 's first trip to the former east prussian capital of königsberg , which came into russian hands after world war ii .
more than 7,000 russians of german origin live in the enclave .
" the past is part of our identity , " fischer said , " but it is also part of the current relations between germany and russia .
the lessons we have to learn from the past are the basis for germany 's special commitment to peace and reconciliation , to european unity and close cooperation with russia . "
kaliningrad will be completely enclosed by the european union after neighboring poland and lithuania become member states on may 1 .
the enclave 's post-accession status precipitated long and difficult negotiations between russia and the european union over transit rights for kaliningrad 's citizens , who will soon have to cross eu territory when traveling to the russian mainland .
however , in 2002 leaders from moscow and brussels reached an agreement establishing a simple travel document for local residents .
with the difficult matter of the transit status of kaliningrad 's citizens behind them , russia and europe are now working to boost relations between kaliningrad and its neighbors .
" this is an important sign of confidence in the foundations of our relationship and proof that russia and germany are united in wanting to shape our future together , that the russian government and the european commission after long , sometimes troublesome negotiations can solve the issue of transit , which is important for both sides , " said fischer .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "
by applying transcendental norms to concrete cognition and action , kant provided one of the cornerstones of scientific philosophy .
it was a breakthrough in thinking that still exercises a considerable influence , demanding , in the words of schmidt , " -lrb- ... -rrb- that the politician , if he wishes to act responsibly , must at the same time take into consideration the consequences of his actions on others . "
for a contemporary politician , kant 's imperative demands that he not take as his " point of departure that which seems to be opportune - and for politicians this is a real challenge , a necessary challenge , " schmidt writes , " but rather weigh all interests affected by his decisions , and all consequences arising from his decisions .

12 , 1804 , but his theories live on .
hardly a philosopher has had more impact on contemporary politics than the german immanuel kant .
his seminal theories on perpetual peace and the categorical imperative still hold sway 200 years after his death . when he published his essay entitled " perpetual peace : a philosophical sketch " in september 1795 for the leipzig book fair , the seemingly unimposing professor immanuel kant changed the world .
the work contained radical demands on those responsible for creating social harmony by suggesting that an alliance be formed between all republican states .
today such an international body more or less exists in the form of the united nations and the european union .
at the time , however , the german philosopher from königsberg -lrb- today kaliningrad -rrb- was breaking new ground and his views were not embraced by europe 's rulers , many of them despotic nobles .
but in paris , kant was greeted as a republican comrade , for his tract signified nothing less than the first modern manifesto for world peace .
no less astonishing was the philosopher 's previous work , " grounding for the metaphysics of morals , " published ten years before his essay on peace .
in it , kant adopted a universal perspective , assuming that the peoples of the world were so closely knit together that a breach of the law in one place would be felt by people everywhere - a philosophical foreshadowing of today 's notion of worldwide networking and globalization .
the moral foundation on which it was based was human reason , which extends beyond the boundaries of individual experience .
kant postulated that reason alone could dictate what was " unconditionally necessary . "
thus , it followed that acting in accordance with this dictate was an absolute duty of the human will , which kant assumed to be autonomous .
this realization gave birth to kant 's seminal theory of the " categorical imperative . "
stated succinctly , kant wrote , " act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . " 200 years of kant more than one hundred years later , the philosopher and social critic theodor w. adorno paid tribute to the genius from königsberg .
as a german jew adorno had witnessed the perversion of the german spirit under the nazis and reflected on the meaning of kant for those living in post-war germany .
" to come of age and look one 's own historical and social situation and the international scene squarely in the eye , would be the job of those who are liable to invoke german tradition , the kants of this world .
his thinking focuses on the concept of autonomy , the responsibility of each reasonable individual for his own actions , instead of those blind dependencies of which one consists of the unreflected supreme power of the national . "
can kant be interpreted as providing impulses for everyday practice , for the actions of politicians ?
helmut schmidt , who was german chancellor from 1974 to 1982 , acknowledged kant 's influence on his political work : " three things in kant are important to me : firstly , the belief in a human ethics based on the fundamental freedom of all people .
secondly , the duty to achieve peace and a community of peoples as a central moral norm , and not only a political norm , not merely based on expediency .
thirdly , and most importantly , the close connection between the principle of moral duty and the principle of reason , or as one might say today : critical reason and critical rationality . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.02.2004 germany , china close to deal on plutonium plant sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon producing plutonium in china ?
the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .

the controversial sale of a german plutonium plant to china is nearing completion , according to news reports .
the deal will include an agreement for regular checks to ensure the plant is not used for military purposes . the german foreign ministry on thursday denied reports that closure of the sale was immediate , saying that officials were continuing to review the proposed sale .
in its thursday edition , the daily berliner zeitung had reported that the german government was close to reaching agreements with both china and the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , which would conduct regular control visits to the plant to make sure plutonium produced there is not used for military purposes . according to news reports , experts from the german economics ministry are currently working with iaea officials in vienna to reach an agreement on this issue .
it remains unclear who would pay for iaea control visits . such an agreement is crucial to secure support from the junior coalition partner in the german government , the greens .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , a member of the greens party , will have to give his approval for the sale .
many party members oppose the deal and an announcement of the sale is therefore likely to be postponed until parliamentary elections in the city state of hamburg , which will take place on feb .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .
" it 's also a good signal for other sectors .
i do n't see any major pay disputes arising in the construction and chemical sectors now . " the deal will also likely give ig metall 's boss peters some breathing space .
if the pay dispute had escalated into a messy labor battle , the beleaguered peters could have faced ouster at the head of germany 's largest manufacturing trade union after lead ig metall into a failed strike last summer in a vain attempt to shorten the workweek in eastern germany from 38 to 35 hours at a time when many in the former communist east were unemployed . that started a power struggle between traditionalists and modernizers in the union who felt the old school leftist peters wouldn ’ t be able to help ig metall adapt to the realities of modern industrial germany . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall 's future hinges on wage talks with a failed strike , internecine power struggles behind it and eroding membership , ig metall 's contentious wage negotiations this year could determine the union ’ s future – and whether it has one .

germany was saved the prospect of major industrial strikes crippling its nascent economic recovery , as the ig metall trade union agreed to a new wage deal with employers on thursday . negotiations going into the wee hours of the morning led to an agreement for the union 's so-called " pilot district " in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg that will likely be applied to metal and engineering workers throughout the country . the 26-month contract will raise wages by 2.2 percent from march 2004 and by 2.7 percent from march 2005 .
ig metall , which had staged brief work stoppages over the past two weeks and had threatened a full-blown strike by the end of the month , had originally sought a four percent increase . " this is without question a good deal , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said on thursday .
" it will help move the economy forward . " many in berlin had feared a bruising labor dispute with ig metall 's 3.5 million workers that could have had a disastrous effect on germany 's economy , which is only now starting to shake off the grips of recession .
after shrinking 0.1 percent in 2003 , the government expects a growth of around 1.7 percent this year . the deal in baden-württemberg covers some of germany 's top industrial companies including carmaker daimlerchrysler .
employers were unable to push through a key demand to return to the 40-hour workweek without extra pay - something the union had fought vehemently against . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pleased that we could convince the employers of the hopelessness of their undertaking , " ig metall chairman jürgen peters said . more flexibility however , the union did make the concession that more flexible hours could be applied to specific companies .
if union representatives at a factory now agree , management can increase the standard 35-hour week without hiking workers wages . " it looks like a fair compromise .
i do n't see any inflationary impact and it 's a step forward in terms of labor flexibility , " manuela preuschl , an economist at deutsche bank in frankfurt , told the reuters news agency .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .

it refers to an absolute , unconditional requirement that allows for no exceptions .
it is both required and justified as an end in itself , and not as a as means to some other end .
it 's opposite is the hypothetical imperative .
kant maintains that all categorical imperatives can be derived from a single one known as the categorical imperative .
in his groundwork for the metaphysics of morals , published in 1875 , kant formulates the categorical imperative in three different ways .
the first -lrb- called the universal law formulation -rrb- : " act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law . "
the second -lrb- humanity or end in itself formulation -rrb- : " act in such a way that you always treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of any other , never simply as a means , but always at the same time as an end . "
the third -lrb- kingdom of ends formulation -rrb- combines the first two explanations : " all maxims as proceeding from our own -lsb- hypothetical or subjective -rsb- making of law ought to harmonize with a possible kingdom of ends . "
on immorality following kant 's postulates , immorality arises when one veers from the categorical imperative , for example , when a person attempts to set a different standard for themselves than for the rest of humanity .
morally permissible behavior is determined on the basis of whether or not a certain action , when applied universally , leads to the end of civilized culture .
if it does , it is immoral .
if , on the other hand , no one took that given action and as a result civilization was destroyed , then that behavior is morally obligatory . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a philosopher for the modern age dw-world has put together a collection of texts on kant , his home town of königsberg and the philosopher 's relevance for the modern age .

german foreign minister fischer is scheduled to open the first consulate general in kaliningrad on thursday , the 200th anniversary of the death of philosopher immanuel kant , the city 's most famous son . once fischer has appointed the new consulate general cornelius sommer at the inauguration ceremony , he 'll be heading to the kant mausoleum to lay flowers at the philosopher 's grave , located in the heart of what was once the grand city of königsberg , the prussian capital .
he 'll then continue to moscow for talks with russian president vladimir putin and foreign minister igor ivanov .
plans for a kaliningrad branch have been in the pipeline since the early 1990s , but were held up by russian concerns that post-reunification germany might want to reclaim the former prussian territory .

february 12th marks the 200th anniversary of immanuel kant 's death .
dw-tv talked to german foreign minister joschka fischer about the philosopher 's impact on today 's politics . on wednesday fischer travels to the russian baltic enclave of kaliningrad where he will install the first german consulate in office .
while visiting in the former prussian town of königsberg , fischer plans to visit the grave of one of germany 's greatest philosophers and a native son of the town , immanuel kant .
fischer is a great admirer of the author of perpetual peace and critique of pure reason and a firm believer in many of the philosopher 's theories .
dw-tv caught up with the foreign minister and asked him what kant means to him personally .
joschka fischer : he 's one of the great philosophers .
i 've read all his important works and i believe the influence on political thinking of , for example , his seminal work perpetual peace is once again apparent in current discussions .
kant 's ideas , his practical philosophy , his ethical theories such as the categorical imperative and his critique of pure reason , had a lasting influence on western thinking that goes far beyond the german-speaking world .
in perpetual peace , kant lays out his concept for a world government .
is the u.n. borne out of kant 's theories ?
i do believe that kant is the most influential thinker of the modern age .
so even though he may not have been thinking of a specific body such as the u.n. , he did consider the effects of a world state based on a union of countries .
you can see how a lot of kant 's ideas helped shape the u.n. , and perpetual peace is definitely steeped in the spirit of global governance .
which aspects of kant 's thinking are still relevant to politicians today ?
the obvious answer would be in matters of moral law .
but if you want to avoid obvious answers , then one could cite his emphasis on reason , and the importance of maintaining a rational view of the world while also recognizing the limits of reason .
i think the most important lesson that politicians can learn from kant is that our world is a rational one .
the principle that it 's based on an ethical foundation is part of that , as is accepting the limitations of reason .
politicians have to be aware that sometimes people act irrationally , and they have to be prepared for this eventuality .
russian intellectuals have a very different response to kant .
is he too rational and german ?
i could n't say .
i 'm not an expert .
but i always wanted to go to königsberg -lrb- kaliningrad -rrb- and see kant 's grave .
and now i 'm actually going to , because the consulate general is opening the same week as the 200th anniversary of his death .
he 's been one of my biggest influences , along with hegel and marx .
like i say , kant subscribes to the theory of a rational world .
he 's a highly modern thinker !
in kaliningrad there 's a cult of kant , especially among young people .
what do you think of the idea of renaming kaliningrad kantgrad ?
that 's something that they 'll have to discuss and decide themselves .
i 'm not going to comment .
but i 'm looking forward to the visit .

a 21-year study showed a quarter of the 419 men released from prison in 1979 received another sexual conviction .
a fifth of those waited at least 10 years before sexually offending .
the report published in the journal of legal and criminal psychology raises questions about whether current supervision periods are sufficient .
the study sample consisted of all adult male sexual offenders discharged from prison in england and wales during 1979 .
of the 419 men , 103 were reconvicted for a sexual offence in the next 21 years .
reconviction rates -lrb- % -rrb- 2 years : 43 men -lrb- 10.3 -rrb- 5 years : 66 men -lrb- 15.8 -rrb- 10 years : 84 men -lrb- 20.0 -rrb- 21 years : 103 men -lrb- 24.6 -rrb- * source : sexual offenders report some waited beyond 10 or 15 years before reoffending .
the report questions whether those who do not reoffend should be supervised in the community for longer than the current maximum 10 years .

a home office spokesman said this would have considerable time and cost implications .

an extra 450 graduates will be trained in less than half the time it usually takes to complete a social work degree .
the scottish executive is planning to invest £ 14m over the next five years .
a further £ 9.25m will go towards improving on-the-job training for students and training for care staff at voluntary organisations .
the investment will bring the number of fast-track social workers to 550 - more than 10 % of the current national workforce .
it enables graduates with any degree or experience to retrain as social workers within 16 to 23 months , instead of four years to complete a social work degree .
the benefit to local authorities is that we get a fresh pool of high calibre graduates into the profession eric jackson cosla scotland 's deputy education minister euan robson said there are more than 4,000 social workers in scotland but demand for their services means councils need to employ over 600 more .
he added : " the fast track scheme enables suitable graduates to qualify more quickly and today 's massive expansion of the scheme comes on top of other measures to recruit new social workers .
" the additional £ 6.25m we have announced today for the practice learning framework will allow universities to work with councils and the voluntary sector to enhance the quality , quantity and diversity of student placements . "
' permanent job ' the investment has been welcomed by the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- and community care providers scotland -lrb- ccps -rrb- , which represents voluntary sector service providers .
councillor eric jackson , cosla 's social work spokesman , said : " the benefit to local authorities is that we get a fresh pool of high calibre graduates into the profession who are eager to make a difference and who have made a positive life choice to do so .
" the benefit to the students is that they are employed and paid a salary while they train and are guaranteed a permanent job when they qualify .
annie gunner , of ccps , said : " voluntary organisations now provide a very substantial proportion of scotland 's care services , and we recognise the need for staff to be trained and qualified to a high standard .
" ccps has highlighted the need to fund voluntary organisations directly and this important initiative will help them to do so . "

the report 's findings , which led to the closure of swansea leisure centre - which was one of wales ' top attractions - have been obtained by bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme .
throughout the centre , it said that surveyors found both white and the more dangerous brown asbestos - both of which are now banned in the uk as breathing in fibres can lead to asbestosis .
then the report went onto say that experts warned the ventilation system " may be blowing airborne asbestos fibres into the swimming pool area " .
asbestosis can lead to the scarring of lung tissue and cancer ..
swansea council say the pool area was subsequently tested for asbestos fibres though none was found .
the electrics were seen as so hazardous that consultants described " a permanent risk of fire and / or electric shock on site " .

hygiene was also described as seriously deficient , with the kitchens in an " appalling state " .
the centre , which was opened by the queen in 1977 , closed in november 2003 after swansea council said a structural report on the building showed it needed extensive repairs .
a swansea council spokesman said the leisure centre was shut " following an in-depth building condition survey undertaken by consultants " .
there has been a campaign among some city residents to reopen the popular facility .
the council intended replacing it with a new leisure and conference facility and , although 11 firms are interested in the development , it is likely to be several years before it opens .
meanwhile the authority met with union officials on thursday to discuss the future of the 96 leisure centre employees .
it said 32 had been redeployed into other jobs , 12 were on trial periods in posts , 22 had not expressed any interest in redeployment , eight had resigned , two temporary contracts were terminated and one member of staff had taken a career break .

fatima mukhadirova , 63 , is the mother of a man who died in prison , allegedly after he was immersed in boiling water and otherwise tortured .
she was arrested after she drew attention to her son 's death and charged with trying to undermine the constitution of uzbekistan .
the judge handed down a maximum sentence of six years in a hard prison .
mrs mukhadirova was taken away in an armoured van , looking pale and drawn , according to the bbc 's monica whitlock in uzbekistan .
her surviving children called out their goodbyes and handed the police food to take to jail .
most were crying .
looking for justice mrs mukhadirova was accused of distributing extremist literature - that is , pamphlets propagating an islamic state .
there had been a hope that she would be acquitted because her lawyer was strong and independent .
that would have made history here , but it was a tiny hope , our correspondent says .
acquitting mrs mukhadirova would have raised questions about the reliability of police evidence and the death of her son muzafar .
he was convicted of belonging to an illegal religious group and died in prison last year .
human rights groups have said that he was immersed in boiling water , but the government maintains that he had heart disease and died after a fight with cell mates who threw scalding tea at him .
photographs of the body appeared to show that his fingernails had been removed .
government policy the verdict passed on his mother sends a strong signal that there will be no rethinking of official strategy towards people it regards as seditious , our correspondent says .
uzbekistan is a close ally of the united states , and the us embassy sent a local monitor to the trial .
mukhadirova 's lawyer , alisher ergashev , argued in his summing up on wednesday that authorities failed to prove the leaflets found in mrs mukhadirova 's home belonged to her because she lives with 10 relatives .
mirzakayum avazov , mrs mukhadirova 's youngest son , said authorities " did n't like her making the circumstances of my brother 's death public " .
" my mother was simply trying to defend her sons and looked for justice , she only wanted those guilty of muzafar 's death to be punished , " he said outside the courtroom .

fatima mukhadirova , 63 , is the mother of a man who died in prison , allegedly after he was immersed in boiling water and otherwise tortured .
she was arrested after she drew attention to her son 's death and charged with trying to undermine the constitution of uzbekistan .
the judge handed down a maximum sentence of six years in a hard prison .
mrs mukhadirova was taken away in an armoured van , looking pale and drawn , according to the bbc 's monica whitlock in uzbekistan .
her surviving children called out their goodbyes and handed the police food to take to jail .
most were crying .
looking for justice mrs mukhadirova was accused of distributing extremist literature - that is , pamphlets propagating an islamic state .
there had been a hope that she would be acquitted because her lawyer was strong and independent .
that would have made history here , but it was a tiny hope , our correspondent says .
acquitting mrs mukhadirova would have raised questions about the reliability of police evidence and the death of her son muzafar .
he was convicted of belonging to an illegal religious group and died in prison last year .
human rights groups have said that he was immersed in boiling water , but the government maintains that he had heart disease and died after a fight with cell mates who threw scalding tea at him .
photographs of the body appeared to show that his fingernails had been removed .
government policy the verdict passed on his mother sends a strong signal that there will be no rethinking of official strategy towards people it regards as seditious , our correspondent says .
uzbekistan is a close ally of the united states , and the us embassy sent a local monitor to the trial .
mukhadirova 's lawyer , alisher ergashev , argued in his summing up on wednesday that authorities failed to prove the leaflets found in mrs mukhadirova 's home belonged to her because she lives with 10 relatives .
mirzakayum avazov , mrs mukhadirova 's youngest son , said authorities " did n't like her making the circumstances of my brother 's death public " .
" my mother was simply trying to defend her sons and looked for justice , she only wanted those guilty of muzafar 's death to be punished , " he said outside the courtroom .

it follows eu reforms meant to break the link between subsidies and the volume of production .
part of the £ 2bn annual budget is expected to be by volume but part of it on a flat-rate , per-acre basis .
ministers believe this would encourage diversity and green farming - but some farmers say they could be ruined .
eu farm ministers agreed last year on the reforms of the widely-criticised common agricultural policy .
that paid subsidies to farmers according to how much food they produced , but it was criticised for distorting trade and harming the countryside .
it 's going to mean less stock kept on farms ... less stocks go to the slaughter houses , less carcasses go to the cutting plant , which means less jobs , less english meat on the shelves livestock farmer dave morgan from next year , farmers will start getting a single flat-rate payment instead - but governments can introduce this gradually if they want .
wales has chosen to give subsidies entirely as before , and scotland is likely to do the same .
but northern ireland has chosen a " hybrid " system and england is likely to follow suit .
the flat-rate part of the scheme would mean some sectors which were previously unsubsidised , like poultry or vegetable farming , would receive payouts .
these would be given on the basis that certain environmental conditions were met .
fruit farmer david snell , from ross-on-wye in herefordshire , told bbc news he supported the scheme - which would give him a subsidy for the first time and encourage him to greener farming .
' worse off ' but livestock farmer dave morgan said he depends on a six-figure annual subsidy cheque , and without it he and many others could go out of business .
this , in turn , would be bad for the public , he said .
governments will be concerned not to move too far away from each other and not too far away , i 'm afraid , from where we have been professor ken thompson , aberdeen university " it 's going to mean less stock kept on farms , it 's going to mean less stocks go to the slaughter houses , less carcasses go to the cutting plant , which means less jobs , less english meat on the shelves for the public to buy . "
bbc radio 4 's farming today 's sarah falkingham said that under a wholly flat-rate system , hill farms would come out better , as would fruit and vegetable farms - but cereal farms , mixed farms and lowland livestock farms would lose out .
but professor ken thompson , from the land economy department of aberdeen university , said farmers should not be too worried .
" governments will be concerned not to move too far away from each other and not too far away , i 'm afraid , from where we have been , " he said .

andy and paul camsell set out on boxing day in a clapped-out fiat panda for the plymouth-dakar rally 2004 , intending to raise £ 10,000 for charity .
three weeks and 4,110 miles later , they arrived in the gambian village of nyofelleh and handed over the car - still in working order - to a foundation running a school and pharmacy .
it was a real eye-opener - it was n't what i expected it to be and it certainly was n't a holiday andy camsell the brothers , both from crowborough in east sussex , have not yet managed to raise the sponsorship they hoped for but says the trip has changed their lives .
father-of-three andy , 34 , said : " it was a real eye-opener - it was n't what i expected it to be and it certainly was n't a holiday .
" it 's amazing how you see the difference out there .
it makes you feel really humble .
" there are kids who walk barefoot five miles to school every day because they prize education so highly . "
the computer engineer is now determined to raise more cash - and may even write a book about his experiences .
in the desert the brothers slept in the car or camped by sand dunes the journey started with a day-and-night slog through france and spain to gibraltar , where they met up with the other rally drivers .
unlike the famous paris-dakar rally , the plymouth version is a challenge for bangers that have seen better days .
under the rally 's rules , the competing cars have to cost less than £ 100 and no outside support is allowed .
after new year celebrations in marrakesh , the convoy headed on through morocco to agadir .
andy said : " that 's where things started going wrong .
dirt tracks " the car started making some really strange noises and , in the middle of a set of roadworks , smoke started billowing into the car .
we leapt out . "
the brothers , participating under the name desert prats , managed to fix what turned out to be an alternator problem - but lost most of their party in the meantime .
when they reached the sahara - the most hazardous part of their journey - their 1989 fiat panda sisley 4x4 special edition was accompanied only by a ford transit van and a volvo .
the brothers crossed a minefield in the sahara " you cross into mauritania and into the desert - and into the really dodgy part , with 17km of minefield , " said andy .
" after morocco the tarmac ends and you 're on dirt tracks .
in the minefield you have what they call the old spanish road , just loose stones .
" it 's really creepy in there - there are lots of cars about but everyone 's picking their way through and you can see burnt-out cars all around . "
however , it was the corruption at border crossings which proved to be a real challenge .
what i say is ' if i can drive to the gambia , i can do anything ' andy camsell " everyone 's asking for a ' petit cadeau ' - that was a phrase we became quite familiar with , " said andy .
but everything changed when the brothers , now reunited with the rest of the convoy , reached the gambia .
" we got to banjul , where there was a victory parade , " andy said .
" everyone was flashing their lights , sounding their horns - it was absolutely superb . "
the next day , the brothers made their way to nyofelleh , where they donated their vehicle to the derek bailey foundation .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- will snap school inspections work ?

schools in england could face more frequent , " light-touch " inspections , says ofsted chief david bell .
this could lead to inspections every three years rather than the current six .
mr bell has claimed that " shorter , sharper " inspections would provide parents with more up-to-date information as well as saving schools up to 10 weeks of anxious preparation .
however there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny .
will snap school inspections raise standards ?
or will they increase pressure on both teachers and students ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly lou , west midlands every three years is not often at all .
if schools are run well they should be worried of feel under scrutiny .
i think school should be inspected without any prior warning each year .
when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly .
lessons were also planned in advance of the inspections .
lou , west midlands i 'm a teacher and i would love snap inspections .
at the moment we get far too much warning .
we are due to have the inspectors in march and the management have spent tens of thousands of pounds on all sorts of trivial rubbish , to smarten the place up in the hope that they are going to be impressed with new carpets and plastic plants .
let the inspectorate see what the place is really like all the year round !
anon , scotland no !
it will be further money wasted .
new initiatives need to be put in place - not more inspections .
james , dorset , uk a much better idea than giving a school days to prepare - our school used to change everything when ofsted came calling , we planned in advance making the whole thing stupid and pointless .
tom , england we are talking about the future of our children here .
the teachers must come second in this and be prepared to take a little more stress if it keeps standards up .
do n't teachers give their pupils snap tests from time to time ?
gary gatter , london , uk my wife is a teacher and it 's clear that the main bugbear with inspections is the need to have reams of paperwork that normally never happen .
she 'll now have to waste hours on a regular basis preparing unnecessary papers on the off-chance that mr ofsted will drop in .
it 's not that the coursework is unstructured it 's just that an experienced teacher knows where her pupils are at and what 's needed without having to write it down all the time .
jonathan , wiltshire teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system christine , uk as a teacher i much favour the short notice inspections .
with all the advance warning we get now , the inspected lessons become overprepared and unnatural and i personally consider myself a worse teacher when inspected than under normal circumstances .
teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system and something has to be wrong with a system where parents of disruptive children are encouraged to keep their kids out of school during inspection week .
christine , uk whilst i understand the comments made that good teachers have nothing to fear , the converse is actually true .
good teachers often work on their own professional initiative and refuse to buckle to the ridiculous paperwork imposed by a centralised control .
ofsted have , for many years , been the shocktroops of the government , seeing that irrelevant targets are set and mountains of bureaucracy are filled in .
perniciously , ofsted sees as successful those who subject themselves to centralised control .
on this basis , good , independent and professional teachers are often classified as failing .
chris , yorks , uk in all honesty , why are schools not up to inspection standards every day ?
any respectable school will reach the inspective standard and maintain the level to present a better image for the school , leaving schools that do not meet the current standard to realistically seek a leadership restructure .
peter richards , port talbot , wales schools would present a far truer picture sally , spalding as a teacher i think this is an excellent idea as schools would present a far truer picture .
it may be that all the paperwork would not be up to date , but if the children are being well taught , that surely , is more important .
if inspectors see the amount of paperwork outstanding at school after school , and hear the same reasons given , there may even be an incentive to limit this largely pointless exercise .
and if schools are in a poor state of repair , then it will be shown that more needs to be given in funding .
sally , spalding i note with great sadness , the thoroughly negative stance and attitude that many of the comments in this section have towards teachers and schools .
i wish some parents and members of the public would accept that there are a great many teachers who work hard , work consistently and enjoy their job .
a great many of us do a fantastic job and provide our pupils with superb levels of teaching and learning .
for goodness sake - give us a break ! !
mark , newcastle , uk as a nursing home manager , i had to be prepared for unannounced inspections day or night from the local health authority .
we had no notice at all of these inspections , and it meant standards had to be consistent .
if teachers are such consummate professionals , and all of their spare time is used for lesson preparation and marking as they claim , then they will have nothing to fear from any inspection !
alun thomas , swansea , wales i have one hours notice when our company 's directors have been rumoured to be on their way .
i have to maintain standards all the time - why should teachers not be - they do get well paid for it and despite the moaning they get more than me !
tony humphreys , prestatyn , wales my college has just had its ofsted inspection and a day before they came we had new chairs , interactive wipe boards , new licks of paint which was purely for the inspectors .
the college also told a friend of mines son not to turn up to lessons during the week so that they could fiddle the books and the inspectors would n't know .
i think snap inspections will benefit both pupils ' and staff .
scott , middlesbrough if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear kate , uk i believe that there should be no warnings of an inspection .
it is what happens on a day-to-day basis in schools and colleges that is important , not what can be produced ' royal visit ' style when an inspection is known to be happening .
i work in education and i have seen how the picture can be falsified for the benefit of inspectors .
if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear .
kate , uk if snap inspections were to start tomorrow then there would be uproar as few schools would gain anywhere near the levels found at the moment .
the problem rarely lies with the school though .
how can the average teacher be expected to provide the best possible education to their class when they are snowed under by mountains of pointless paperwork , are chronically under funded in many areas and have no effective means of stopping any troublemakers that they may have in their class .
simon , uk i work at a school that has ofsted in this week .
over the last few weeks as the teachers were preparing for the inspection it was clear that things were being improved purely for the inspectors , and therefore they are not seeing a true picture of how the school is - they 're seeing an idealised " well , this is what we 'd like to be like " version .
i feel that spot checks would be far more effective - at least then ofsted get a true picture !
j , london , uk if teachers feel that these new inspections will increase pressure on them they are not doing their job properly .
a school inspection is merely there to check that schools are adhering to preset standards , if schools are , they will have no problems .
yes it will raise standards as schools should maintain standards all the time rather than rushing to learn them in the weeks before an ofsted visit .
sg , uk let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
dan , lancaster , uk yes why not !
drive more teachers out of the classroom and into the doctor 's waiting room !
let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
the whole system is wrong to start with , do n't make it worse .
dan , lancaster , uk i think that the best way to do it would be surprise inspections whenever and wherever .
if they are not scheduled and the schools are not prepared for it then it will give a much better indication as to how well the school is being run .
making them shorter is n't such a good idea .
i do n't think a shorter visit will be able to gather enough information to form a good report on how well the school is doing .
evaxon to alison of leeds , your friend is as you say under pressure to make things seem better than they really are !
does he honestly believe that will fool the inspectors -lrb- many of whom are former teachers themselves and probably also tried the same thing .
as all schools would have published their examination results and the league tables are in the national and often local newspapers do not the inspectors know the true position !
john , london a friend of mine is a teacher , whose school is being inspected this week .
he 's under pressure to make it appear that things are better than they are normally .
snap inspections would encourage schools to maintain a constant level of high standards , rather than just focussing it for a week every few years .
i 'm sure that teacher work very hard to do their best , but where there are problems these need to be highlighted , not covered up for the inspections .
alison , leeds , uk the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time paul j-w , england , uk there is a body of people that has been overlooked in this new proposal , that of the school governors .
the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time .
the amount of work governors will be required to do , at a time when the leas are already increasing the number of duties governors are expected to carry out would be considerable .
after all we are only volunteers , and under the new ofsted structure governors will also be more closely inspected .
this means that the school may pass as outstanding , but if the governors fail one tick box , the school then fails .
paul j-w , england , uk i think there should be no notice at all for inspections , and the schools should not be able to prepare for one by expecting them every three years .
ofsted would then quickly find out how much of the pointless form filling is quietly ignored by most teachers , and just how badly behaved pupils are .
mark blackman , london it is difficult to see whether this will work until it has happened .
it is a good idea to have inspections more often , shorter inspections may mean that they will see less .
it will also be more effective if the schools can not prepare too much for the inspections , as it means that the inspectors will not see the school as it normally is .
helen , england snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools simon canfer , swindon snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools .
why should anyone believe the current system gives a real picture of teaching when the lessons taught are atypical ?
snap inspections would also reduce stress on teacher 's families who currently suffer in the long run up to inspections .
more frequent inspections would also give a more up-to-date picture of schools ; what use to me , as a parent , is a 1999 inspection report in 2004 ?
simon canfer , swindon uk i remember when the school inspectors came when i was in high school , they were not given a true picture at all , everywhere was freshly painted , paintings went up on the walls , there were flowers in tubs etc etc and everyone was threatened to be on their best behaviour .
spot checks with no notice would give a real picture of how schools are not the ' rose tinted ' view that the inspectors are given when schools are warned of a visit liz , cardiff please do not immediately assume that all teachers are good teachers .
my husband sometimes helps neighbours with their science homework and he actually shrieks in horror how they are being taught .
he just wonders how these teachers get away with it ?
inspections should be as often as possible to get rid of hopeless individuals teaching our children .
inga , england let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out mark j , england i have been through two ofsted inspections as a teacher and i welcome this move .
at the moment schools get weeks of notice and the ' preparations begin ' - new materials are bought , flowers appear , pupils ' bribed ' to behave .
i have even seen the ' worst students ' disappear on ' work experience ' during ofsted week !
let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out .
mark j , england there should be no warning period at all .
only through inspectors seeing what these schools are really like will they improve .
teachers who are organised and professional should n't worry because they have already got their act together .
as a student i had a few teachers who were almost as " slap dash " as the students .
this sort of " continuous assessment " will improve my children 's education .
stephen , uk ' those that can , teach .
those that ca n't become ofsted inspectors ' .
the teachers on the front line have to deal with the pressures of uncontrollable kids and teach at the same time .
i would love to see some of those ofsted inspectors have a go at teaching rather than just undermine committed teachers by making a critical judgement on the basis of observing one lesson .
if this happens i predict it will just result in more experienced and dedicated teachers leaving the profession tim , bromley , uk good idea .
our college is being inspected in march , and we 've known about it for months .
schools and colleges use the months of notice to put on a show , papering over cracks in order to pass inspection .
the entire system is a sham .
figures show that the students are the ones who suffer most , with noticeably lower grades during inspection years .
the amount of pointless paperwork -lrb- self assessment reports etc -rrb- required is causing enormous stress to staff who would much rather be teaching their students .
the entire inspection grading system would have to be overhauled too , as the government realise how little they have actually been learning about schools over the years .
rich , hants , uk as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good tim benson , london financial expediency rather than educational reform is powering this initiative .
the present system is costing many millions a year to tell us , all but a tiny proportion of schools are doing well .
save even more , scrap the system .
as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good .
tim benson , london i do n't feel that a snap inspection from ofsted will provide more up-to-date information for parents .
it will just increase pressure on overworked , stressed teachers .
this policy can do no good , only harm and drive away even more teachers from an already overstretched and depleted workforce .
m taylor , oldham , lancs if teachers are doing their jobs properly there should be no reason for them to feel stressed .
the ones who are just no good or lazy will be found out .
ideally no notice at all should be given - inspectors should just turn up .
jp , london what about having one day a year when the government or one of its quangos does n't decide to launch yet another change or half-baked idea just to show that they are alive .
it 's just another publicity stunt .
leave education alone for a time and instead reform the long holidays , generous unscrutinised expenses and extra incomes politicians get .
tom smith , worcs , england inspectors should just turn up stuart , romford they would only work if there was no notice given to the schools .
inspectors should just turn up and they would really see what a disgrace our education system is under new labour .
giving them notice will only allow the school heads to close shop and paint a rosy picture .
stuart , romford , uk the reason why ofsted inspections are so frightening for teachers is that their usual lessons are not acceptable for these inspections and lessons during an ofsted inspection are taught to a much higher standard than usual lessons .
it would in fact be impossible for teachers to teach to this standard for every lesson and on every day .
snap inspections will show teachers giving much more ' normal ' lessons and this should be acceptable .
sarah cotter , woodbridge i think it 's a fantastic idea !
it will stop schools in the run up of inspections deciding to redecorate the school like they did when we had out inspection .
the outcome of the inspection is meant to offer advice and help the school improve and they will get a more honest approach if the school are caught off guard rather than getting weeks of warning .
louise , surrey so what will be the problem with having these " shorter sharper " inspections .
teachers are no different than me or any other person who works .
our performance is being assessed on a regular basis without any special arrangements .
oh , and our establishment is under constant scrutiny by our customers - if we fail " inspection " then we go out of business and have no jobs to go to , a school fails an inspection and they get some free remedial treatment from the shareholders -lrb- taxpayers -rrb- .
no sympathy here i 'm afraid .
trevor , colchester , uk what will mr bell suggest next ?
perhaps giving students only two days notice of an a-level exam ?
brian rudd , newport pagnell , bucks this is a money-saving exercise and nothing whatever to do with standards .
the increased frequency and reduced warning given for , inspections can only increase the pressure on teachers without any prospect that it will lead to higher standards .
it is typical of this government that it changes policies and guidelines on a regular basis to give the impression of active government , but actually leaves the poor teachers reeling , demoralised and overworked .
these are not weapons inspections imposed on rogue states , they are meant to assist schools in the improvements that they honestly wish to make .
frank , london , uk i used to work for a well known supermarket who would be ' tipped off ' that the health inspectors coming .
what 's the point of telling someone they are going to be inspected if the motive is improve quality .
phillip ellis , uk so , " there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny . "
what 's wrong with that ?

schools in england could face more frequent , " light-touch " inspections , says ofsted chief david bell .
this could lead to inspections every three years rather than the current six .
mr bell has claimed that " shorter , sharper " inspections would provide parents with more up-to-date information as well as saving schools up to 10 weeks of anxious preparation .
however there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny .
will snap school inspections raise standards ?
or will they increase pressure on both teachers and students ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly lou , west midlands every three years is not often at all .
if schools are run well they should be worried of feel under scrutiny .
i think school should be inspected without any prior warning each year .

oh , and our establishment is under constant scrutiny by our customers - if we fail " inspection " then we go out of business and have no jobs to go to , a school fails an inspection and they get some free remedial treatment from the shareholders -lrb- taxpayers -rrb- .
no sympathy here i 'm afraid .
trevor , colchester , uk what will mr bell suggest next ?
perhaps giving students only two days notice of an a-level exam ?
brian rudd , newport pagnell , bucks this is a money-saving exercise and nothing whatever to do with standards .
the increased frequency and reduced warning given for , inspections can only increase the pressure on teachers without any prospect that it will lead to higher standards .
it is typical of this government that it changes policies and guidelines on a regular basis to give the impression of active government , but actually leaves the poor teachers reeling , demoralised and overworked .
these are not weapons inspections imposed on rogue states , they are meant to assist schools in the improvements that they honestly wish to make .

what 's wrong with that ?

schools in england could face more frequent , " light-touch " inspections , says ofsted chief david bell .
this could lead to inspections every three years rather than the current six .
mr bell has claimed that " shorter , sharper " inspections would provide parents with more up-to-date information as well as saving schools up to 10 weeks of anxious preparation .
however there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny .
will snap school inspections raise standards ?
or will they increase pressure on both teachers and students ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly lou , west midlands every three years is not often at all .
if schools are run well they should be worried of feel under scrutiny .
i think school should be inspected without any prior warning each year .
when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly .
lessons were also planned in advance of the inspections .
lou , west midlands i 'm a teacher and i would love snap inspections .
at the moment we get far too much warning .
we are due to have the inspectors in march and the management have spent tens of thousands of pounds on all sorts of trivial rubbish , to smarten the place up in the hope that they are going to be impressed with new carpets and plastic plants .
let the inspectorate see what the place is really like all the year round !
anon , scotland no !
it will be further money wasted .
new initiatives need to be put in place - not more inspections .
james , dorset , uk a much better idea than giving a school days to prepare - our school used to change everything when ofsted came calling , we planned in advance making the whole thing stupid and pointless .
tom , england we are talking about the future of our children here .
the teachers must come second in this and be prepared to take a little more stress if it keeps standards up .
do n't teachers give their pupils snap tests from time to time ?
gary gatter , london , uk my wife is a teacher and it 's clear that the main bugbear with inspections is the need to have reams of paperwork that normally never happen .
she 'll now have to waste hours on a regular basis preparing unnecessary papers on the off-chance that mr ofsted will drop in .
it 's not that the coursework is unstructured it 's just that an experienced teacher knows where her pupils are at and what 's needed without having to write it down all the time .
jonathan , wiltshire teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system christine , uk as a teacher i much favour the short notice inspections .
with all the advance warning we get now , the inspected lessons become overprepared and unnatural and i personally consider myself a worse teacher when inspected than under normal circumstances .
teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system and something has to be wrong with a system where parents of disruptive children are encouraged to keep their kids out of school during inspection week .
christine , uk whilst i understand the comments made that good teachers have nothing to fear , the converse is actually true .
good teachers often work on their own professional initiative and refuse to buckle to the ridiculous paperwork imposed by a centralised control .
ofsted have , for many years , been the shocktroops of the government , seeing that irrelevant targets are set and mountains of bureaucracy are filled in .
perniciously , ofsted sees as successful those who subject themselves to centralised control .
on this basis , good , independent and professional teachers are often classified as failing .
chris , yorks , uk in all honesty , why are schools not up to inspection standards every day ?
any respectable school will reach the inspective standard and maintain the level to present a better image for the school , leaving schools that do not meet the current standard to realistically seek a leadership restructure .
peter richards , port talbot , wales schools would present a far truer picture sally , spalding as a teacher i think this is an excellent idea as schools would present a far truer picture .
it may be that all the paperwork would not be up to date , but if the children are being well taught , that surely , is more important .
if inspectors see the amount of paperwork outstanding at school after school , and hear the same reasons given , there may even be an incentive to limit this largely pointless exercise .
and if schools are in a poor state of repair , then it will be shown that more needs to be given in funding .
sally , spalding i note with great sadness , the thoroughly negative stance and attitude that many of the comments in this section have towards teachers and schools .
i wish some parents and members of the public would accept that there are a great many teachers who work hard , work consistently and enjoy their job .
a great many of us do a fantastic job and provide our pupils with superb levels of teaching and learning .
for goodness sake - give us a break ! !
mark , newcastle , uk as a nursing home manager , i had to be prepared for unannounced inspections day or night from the local health authority .
we had no notice at all of these inspections , and it meant standards had to be consistent .
if teachers are such consummate professionals , and all of their spare time is used for lesson preparation and marking as they claim , then they will have nothing to fear from any inspection !
alun thomas , swansea , wales i have one hours notice when our company 's directors have been rumoured to be on their way .
i have to maintain standards all the time - why should teachers not be - they do get well paid for it and despite the moaning they get more than me !
tony humphreys , prestatyn , wales my college has just had its ofsted inspection and a day before they came we had new chairs , interactive wipe boards , new licks of paint which was purely for the inspectors .
the college also told a friend of mines son not to turn up to lessons during the week so that they could fiddle the books and the inspectors would n't know .
i think snap inspections will benefit both pupils ' and staff .
scott , middlesbrough if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear kate , uk i believe that there should be no warnings of an inspection .
it is what happens on a day-to-day basis in schools and colleges that is important , not what can be produced ' royal visit ' style when an inspection is known to be happening .
i work in education and i have seen how the picture can be falsified for the benefit of inspectors .
if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear .
kate , uk if snap inspections were to start tomorrow then there would be uproar as few schools would gain anywhere near the levels found at the moment .
the problem rarely lies with the school though .
how can the average teacher be expected to provide the best possible education to their class when they are snowed under by mountains of pointless paperwork , are chronically under funded in many areas and have no effective means of stopping any troublemakers that they may have in their class .
simon , uk i work at a school that has ofsted in this week .
over the last few weeks as the teachers were preparing for the inspection it was clear that things were being improved purely for the inspectors , and therefore they are not seeing a true picture of how the school is - they 're seeing an idealised " well , this is what we 'd like to be like " version .
i feel that spot checks would be far more effective - at least then ofsted get a true picture !
j , london , uk if teachers feel that these new inspections will increase pressure on them they are not doing their job properly .
a school inspection is merely there to check that schools are adhering to preset standards , if schools are , they will have no problems .
yes it will raise standards as schools should maintain standards all the time rather than rushing to learn them in the weeks before an ofsted visit .
sg , uk let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
dan , lancaster , uk yes why not !
drive more teachers out of the classroom and into the doctor 's waiting room !
let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
the whole system is wrong to start with , do n't make it worse .
dan , lancaster , uk i think that the best way to do it would be surprise inspections whenever and wherever .
if they are not scheduled and the schools are not prepared for it then it will give a much better indication as to how well the school is being run .
making them shorter is n't such a good idea .
i do n't think a shorter visit will be able to gather enough information to form a good report on how well the school is doing .
evaxon to alison of leeds , your friend is as you say under pressure to make things seem better than they really are !
does he honestly believe that will fool the inspectors -lrb- many of whom are former teachers themselves and probably also tried the same thing .
as all schools would have published their examination results and the league tables are in the national and often local newspapers do not the inspectors know the true position !
john , london a friend of mine is a teacher , whose school is being inspected this week .
he 's under pressure to make it appear that things are better than they are normally .
snap inspections would encourage schools to maintain a constant level of high standards , rather than just focussing it for a week every few years .
i 'm sure that teacher work very hard to do their best , but where there are problems these need to be highlighted , not covered up for the inspections .
alison , leeds , uk the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time paul j-w , england , uk there is a body of people that has been overlooked in this new proposal , that of the school governors .
the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time .
the amount of work governors will be required to do , at a time when the leas are already increasing the number of duties governors are expected to carry out would be considerable .
after all we are only volunteers , and under the new ofsted structure governors will also be more closely inspected .
this means that the school may pass as outstanding , but if the governors fail one tick box , the school then fails .
paul j-w , england , uk i think there should be no notice at all for inspections , and the schools should not be able to prepare for one by expecting them every three years .
ofsted would then quickly find out how much of the pointless form filling is quietly ignored by most teachers , and just how badly behaved pupils are .
mark blackman , london it is difficult to see whether this will work until it has happened .
it is a good idea to have inspections more often , shorter inspections may mean that they will see less .
it will also be more effective if the schools can not prepare too much for the inspections , as it means that the inspectors will not see the school as it normally is .
helen , england snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools simon canfer , swindon snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools .
why should anyone believe the current system gives a real picture of teaching when the lessons taught are atypical ?
snap inspections would also reduce stress on teacher 's families who currently suffer in the long run up to inspections .
more frequent inspections would also give a more up-to-date picture of schools ; what use to me , as a parent , is a 1999 inspection report in 2004 ?
simon canfer , swindon uk i remember when the school inspectors came when i was in high school , they were not given a true picture at all , everywhere was freshly painted , paintings went up on the walls , there were flowers in tubs etc etc and everyone was threatened to be on their best behaviour .
spot checks with no notice would give a real picture of how schools are not the ' rose tinted ' view that the inspectors are given when schools are warned of a visit liz , cardiff please do not immediately assume that all teachers are good teachers .
my husband sometimes helps neighbours with their science homework and he actually shrieks in horror how they are being taught .
he just wonders how these teachers get away with it ?
inspections should be as often as possible to get rid of hopeless individuals teaching our children .
inga , england let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out mark j , england i have been through two ofsted inspections as a teacher and i welcome this move .
at the moment schools get weeks of notice and the ' preparations begin ' - new materials are bought , flowers appear , pupils ' bribed ' to behave .
i have even seen the ' worst students ' disappear on ' work experience ' during ofsted week !
let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out .
mark j , england there should be no warning period at all .
only through inspectors seeing what these schools are really like will they improve .
teachers who are organised and professional should n't worry because they have already got their act together .
as a student i had a few teachers who were almost as " slap dash " as the students .
this sort of " continuous assessment " will improve my children 's education .
stephen , uk ' those that can , teach .
those that ca n't become ofsted inspectors ' .
the teachers on the front line have to deal with the pressures of uncontrollable kids and teach at the same time .
i would love to see some of those ofsted inspectors have a go at teaching rather than just undermine committed teachers by making a critical judgement on the basis of observing one lesson .
if this happens i predict it will just result in more experienced and dedicated teachers leaving the profession tim , bromley , uk good idea .
our college is being inspected in march , and we 've known about it for months .
schools and colleges use the months of notice to put on a show , papering over cracks in order to pass inspection .
the entire system is a sham .
figures show that the students are the ones who suffer most , with noticeably lower grades during inspection years .
the amount of pointless paperwork -lrb- self assessment reports etc -rrb- required is causing enormous stress to staff who would much rather be teaching their students .
the entire inspection grading system would have to be overhauled too , as the government realise how little they have actually been learning about schools over the years .
rich , hants , uk as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good tim benson , london financial expediency rather than educational reform is powering this initiative .
the present system is costing many millions a year to tell us , all but a tiny proportion of schools are doing well .
save even more , scrap the system .
as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good .
tim benson , london i do n't feel that a snap inspection from ofsted will provide more up-to-date information for parents .
it will just increase pressure on overworked , stressed teachers .
this policy can do no good , only harm and drive away even more teachers from an already overstretched and depleted workforce .
m taylor , oldham , lancs if teachers are doing their jobs properly there should be no reason for them to feel stressed .
the ones who are just no good or lazy will be found out .
ideally no notice at all should be given - inspectors should just turn up .
jp , london what about having one day a year when the government or one of its quangos does n't decide to launch yet another change or half-baked idea just to show that they are alive .
it 's just another publicity stunt .
leave education alone for a time and instead reform the long holidays , generous unscrutinised expenses and extra incomes politicians get .
tom smith , worcs , england inspectors should just turn up stuart , romford they would only work if there was no notice given to the schools .
inspectors should just turn up and they would really see what a disgrace our education system is under new labour .
giving them notice will only allow the school heads to close shop and paint a rosy picture .
stuart , romford , uk the reason why ofsted inspections are so frightening for teachers is that their usual lessons are not acceptable for these inspections and lessons during an ofsted inspection are taught to a much higher standard than usual lessons .
it would in fact be impossible for teachers to teach to this standard for every lesson and on every day .
snap inspections will show teachers giving much more ' normal ' lessons and this should be acceptable .
sarah cotter , woodbridge i think it 's a fantastic idea !
it will stop schools in the run up of inspections deciding to redecorate the school like they did when we had out inspection .
the outcome of the inspection is meant to offer advice and help the school improve and they will get a more honest approach if the school are caught off guard rather than getting weeks of warning .
louise , surrey so what will be the problem with having these " shorter sharper " inspections .
teachers are no different than me or any other person who works .
our performance is being assessed on a regular basis without any special arrangements .
oh , and our establishment is under constant scrutiny by our customers - if we fail " inspection " then we go out of business and have no jobs to go to , a school fails an inspection and they get some free remedial treatment from the shareholders -lrb- taxpayers -rrb- .
no sympathy here i 'm afraid .
trevor , colchester , uk what will mr bell suggest next ?
perhaps giving students only two days notice of an a-level exam ?
brian rudd , newport pagnell , bucks this is a money-saving exercise and nothing whatever to do with standards .
the increased frequency and reduced warning given for , inspections can only increase the pressure on teachers without any prospect that it will lead to higher standards .
it is typical of this government that it changes policies and guidelines on a regular basis to give the impression of active government , but actually leaves the poor teachers reeling , demoralised and overworked .
these are not weapons inspections imposed on rogue states , they are meant to assist schools in the improvements that they honestly wish to make .
frank , london , uk i used to work for a well known supermarket who would be ' tipped off ' that the health inspectors coming .
what 's the point of telling someone they are going to be inspected if the motive is improve quality .
phillip ellis , uk so , " there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny . "
what 's wrong with that ?

only through inspectors seeing what these schools are really like will they improve .
teachers who are organised and professional should n't worry because they have already got their act together .
as a student i had a few teachers who were almost as " slap dash " as the students .
this sort of " continuous assessment " will improve my children 's education .
stephen , uk ' those that can , teach .
those that ca n't become ofsted inspectors ' .
the teachers on the front line have to deal with the pressures of uncontrollable kids and teach at the same time .
i would love to see some of those ofsted inspectors have a go at teaching rather than just undermine committed teachers by making a critical judgement on the basis of observing one lesson .
if this happens i predict it will just result in more experienced and dedicated teachers leaving the profession tim , bromley , uk good idea .
our college is being inspected in march , and we 've known about it for months .
schools and colleges use the months of notice to put on a show , papering over cracks in order to pass inspection .
the entire system is a sham .
figures show that the students are the ones who suffer most , with noticeably lower grades during inspection years .
the amount of pointless paperwork -lrb- self assessment reports etc -rrb- required is causing enormous stress to staff who would much rather be teaching their students .
the entire inspection grading system would have to be overhauled too , as the government realise how little they have actually been learning about schools over the years .
rich , hants , uk as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good tim benson , london financial expediency rather than educational reform is powering this initiative .
the present system is costing many millions a year to tell us , all but a tiny proportion of schools are doing well .
save even more , scrap the system .
as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good .
tim benson , london i do n't feel that a snap inspection from ofsted will provide more up-to-date information for parents .
it will just increase pressure on overworked , stressed teachers .
this policy can do no good , only harm and drive away even more teachers from an already overstretched and depleted workforce .
m taylor , oldham , lancs if teachers are doing their jobs properly there should be no reason for them to feel stressed .
the ones who are just no good or lazy will be found out .
ideally no notice at all should be given - inspectors should just turn up .
jp , london what about having one day a year when the government or one of its quangos does n't decide to launch yet another change or half-baked idea just to show that they are alive .
it 's just another publicity stunt .
leave education alone for a time and instead reform the long holidays , generous unscrutinised expenses and extra incomes politicians get .
tom smith , worcs , england inspectors should just turn up stuart , romford they would only work if there was no notice given to the schools .
inspectors should just turn up and they would really see what a disgrace our education system is under new labour .
giving them notice will only allow the school heads to close shop and paint a rosy picture .
stuart , romford , uk the reason why ofsted inspections are so frightening for teachers is that their usual lessons are not acceptable for these inspections and lessons during an ofsted inspection are taught to a much higher standard than usual lessons .
it would in fact be impossible for teachers to teach to this standard for every lesson and on every day .
snap inspections will show teachers giving much more ' normal ' lessons and this should be acceptable .
sarah cotter , woodbridge i think it 's a fantastic idea !
it will stop schools in the run up of inspections deciding to redecorate the school like they did when we had out inspection .
the outcome of the inspection is meant to offer advice and help the school improve and they will get a more honest approach if the school are caught off guard rather than getting weeks of warning .
louise , surrey so what will be the problem with having these " shorter sharper " inspections .
teachers are no different than me or any other person who works .
our performance is being assessed on a regular basis without any special arrangements .
oh , and our establishment is under constant scrutiny by our customers - if we fail " inspection " then we go out of business and have no jobs to go to , a school fails an inspection and they get some free remedial treatment from the shareholders -lrb- taxpayers -rrb- .
no sympathy here i 'm afraid .
trevor , colchester , uk what will mr bell suggest next ?
perhaps giving students only two days notice of an a-level exam ?
brian rudd , newport pagnell , bucks this is a money-saving exercise and nothing whatever to do with standards .
the increased frequency and reduced warning given for , inspections can only increase the pressure on teachers without any prospect that it will lead to higher standards .
it is typical of this government that it changes policies and guidelines on a regular basis to give the impression of active government , but actually leaves the poor teachers reeling , demoralised and overworked .
these are not weapons inspections imposed on rogue states , they are meant to assist schools in the improvements that they honestly wish to make .
frank , london , uk i used to work for a well known supermarket who would be ' tipped off ' that the health inspectors coming .
what 's the point of telling someone they are going to be inspected if the motive is improve quality .
phillip ellis , uk so , " there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny . "
what 's wrong with that ?

schools in england could face more frequent , " light-touch " inspections , says ofsted chief david bell .
this could lead to inspections every three years rather than the current six .
mr bell has claimed that " shorter , sharper " inspections would provide parents with more up-to-date information as well as saving schools up to 10 weeks of anxious preparation .
however there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny .
will snap school inspections raise standards ?
or will they increase pressure on both teachers and students ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly lou , west midlands every three years is not often at all .
if schools are run well they should be worried of feel under scrutiny .
i think school should be inspected without any prior warning each year .
when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly .
lessons were also planned in advance of the inspections .
lou , west midlands i 'm a teacher and i would love snap inspections .
at the moment we get far too much warning .
we are due to have the inspectors in march and the management have spent tens of thousands of pounds on all sorts of trivial rubbish , to smarten the place up in the hope that they are going to be impressed with new carpets and plastic plants .
let the inspectorate see what the place is really like all the year round !
anon , scotland no !
it will be further money wasted .
new initiatives need to be put in place - not more inspections .
james , dorset , uk a much better idea than giving a school days to prepare - our school used to change everything when ofsted came calling , we planned in advance making the whole thing stupid and pointless .
tom , england we are talking about the future of our children here .
the teachers must come second in this and be prepared to take a little more stress if it keeps standards up .
do n't teachers give their pupils snap tests from time to time ?
gary gatter , london , uk my wife is a teacher and it 's clear that the main bugbear with inspections is the need to have reams of paperwork that normally never happen .
she 'll now have to waste hours on a regular basis preparing unnecessary papers on the off-chance that mr ofsted will drop in .
it 's not that the coursework is unstructured it 's just that an experienced teacher knows where her pupils are at and what 's needed without having to write it down all the time .
jonathan , wiltshire teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system christine , uk as a teacher i much favour the short notice inspections .
with all the advance warning we get now , the inspected lessons become overprepared and unnatural and i personally consider myself a worse teacher when inspected than under normal circumstances .
teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system and something has to be wrong with a system where parents of disruptive children are encouraged to keep their kids out of school during inspection week .
christine , uk whilst i understand the comments made that good teachers have nothing to fear , the converse is actually true .
good teachers often work on their own professional initiative and refuse to buckle to the ridiculous paperwork imposed by a centralised control .
ofsted have , for many years , been the shocktroops of the government , seeing that irrelevant targets are set and mountains of bureaucracy are filled in .
perniciously , ofsted sees as successful those who subject themselves to centralised control .
on this basis , good , independent and professional teachers are often classified as failing .
chris , yorks , uk in all honesty , why are schools not up to inspection standards every day ?
any respectable school will reach the inspective standard and maintain the level to present a better image for the school , leaving schools that do not meet the current standard to realistically seek a leadership restructure .
peter richards , port talbot , wales schools would present a far truer picture sally , spalding as a teacher i think this is an excellent idea as schools would present a far truer picture .
it may be that all the paperwork would not be up to date , but if the children are being well taught , that surely , is more important .
if inspectors see the amount of paperwork outstanding at school after school , and hear the same reasons given , there may even be an incentive to limit this largely pointless exercise .
and if schools are in a poor state of repair , then it will be shown that more needs to be given in funding .
sally , spalding i note with great sadness , the thoroughly negative stance and attitude that many of the comments in this section have towards teachers and schools .
i wish some parents and members of the public would accept that there are a great many teachers who work hard , work consistently and enjoy their job .
a great many of us do a fantastic job and provide our pupils with superb levels of teaching and learning .
for goodness sake - give us a break ! !
mark , newcastle , uk as a nursing home manager , i had to be prepared for unannounced inspections day or night from the local health authority .
we had no notice at all of these inspections , and it meant standards had to be consistent .
if teachers are such consummate professionals , and all of their spare time is used for lesson preparation and marking as they claim , then they will have nothing to fear from any inspection !
alun thomas , swansea , wales i have one hours notice when our company 's directors have been rumoured to be on their way .
i have to maintain standards all the time - why should teachers not be - they do get well paid for it and despite the moaning they get more than me !
tony humphreys , prestatyn , wales my college has just had its ofsted inspection and a day before they came we had new chairs , interactive wipe boards , new licks of paint which was purely for the inspectors .
the college also told a friend of mines son not to turn up to lessons during the week so that they could fiddle the books and the inspectors would n't know .
i think snap inspections will benefit both pupils ' and staff .
scott , middlesbrough if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear kate , uk i believe that there should be no warnings of an inspection .
it is what happens on a day-to-day basis in schools and colleges that is important , not what can be produced ' royal visit ' style when an inspection is known to be happening .
i work in education and i have seen how the picture can be falsified for the benefit of inspectors .
if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear .
kate , uk if snap inspections were to start tomorrow then there would be uproar as few schools would gain anywhere near the levels found at the moment .
the problem rarely lies with the school though .
how can the average teacher be expected to provide the best possible education to their class when they are snowed under by mountains of pointless paperwork , are chronically under funded in many areas and have no effective means of stopping any troublemakers that they may have in their class .
simon , uk i work at a school that has ofsted in this week .
over the last few weeks as the teachers were preparing for the inspection it was clear that things were being improved purely for the inspectors , and therefore they are not seeing a true picture of how the school is - they 're seeing an idealised " well , this is what we 'd like to be like " version .
i feel that spot checks would be far more effective - at least then ofsted get a true picture !
j , london , uk if teachers feel that these new inspections will increase pressure on them they are not doing their job properly .
a school inspection is merely there to check that schools are adhering to preset standards , if schools are , they will have no problems .
yes it will raise standards as schools should maintain standards all the time rather than rushing to learn them in the weeks before an ofsted visit .
sg , uk let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
dan , lancaster , uk yes why not !
drive more teachers out of the classroom and into the doctor 's waiting room !
let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
the whole system is wrong to start with , do n't make it worse .
dan , lancaster , uk i think that the best way to do it would be surprise inspections whenever and wherever .
if they are not scheduled and the schools are not prepared for it then it will give a much better indication as to how well the school is being run .
making them shorter is n't such a good idea .
i do n't think a shorter visit will be able to gather enough information to form a good report on how well the school is doing .
evaxon to alison of leeds , your friend is as you say under pressure to make things seem better than they really are !
does he honestly believe that will fool the inspectors -lrb- many of whom are former teachers themselves and probably also tried the same thing .
as all schools would have published their examination results and the league tables are in the national and often local newspapers do not the inspectors know the true position !
john , london a friend of mine is a teacher , whose school is being inspected this week .
he 's under pressure to make it appear that things are better than they are normally .
snap inspections would encourage schools to maintain a constant level of high standards , rather than just focussing it for a week every few years .
i 'm sure that teacher work very hard to do their best , but where there are problems these need to be highlighted , not covered up for the inspections .
alison , leeds , uk the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time paul j-w , england , uk there is a body of people that has been overlooked in this new proposal , that of the school governors .
the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time .
the amount of work governors will be required to do , at a time when the leas are already increasing the number of duties governors are expected to carry out would be considerable .
after all we are only volunteers , and under the new ofsted structure governors will also be more closely inspected .
this means that the school may pass as outstanding , but if the governors fail one tick box , the school then fails .
paul j-w , england , uk i think there should be no notice at all for inspections , and the schools should not be able to prepare for one by expecting them every three years .
ofsted would then quickly find out how much of the pointless form filling is quietly ignored by most teachers , and just how badly behaved pupils are .
mark blackman , london it is difficult to see whether this will work until it has happened .
it is a good idea to have inspections more often , shorter inspections may mean that they will see less .
it will also be more effective if the schools can not prepare too much for the inspections , as it means that the inspectors will not see the school as it normally is .
helen , england snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools simon canfer , swindon snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools .
why should anyone believe the current system gives a real picture of teaching when the lessons taught are atypical ?
snap inspections would also reduce stress on teacher 's families who currently suffer in the long run up to inspections .
more frequent inspections would also give a more up-to-date picture of schools ; what use to me , as a parent , is a 1999 inspection report in 2004 ?
simon canfer , swindon uk i remember when the school inspectors came when i was in high school , they were not given a true picture at all , everywhere was freshly painted , paintings went up on the walls , there were flowers in tubs etc etc and everyone was threatened to be on their best behaviour .
spot checks with no notice would give a real picture of how schools are not the ' rose tinted ' view that the inspectors are given when schools are warned of a visit liz , cardiff please do not immediately assume that all teachers are good teachers .
my husband sometimes helps neighbours with their science homework and he actually shrieks in horror how they are being taught .
he just wonders how these teachers get away with it ?
inspections should be as often as possible to get rid of hopeless individuals teaching our children .
inga , england let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out mark j , england i have been through two ofsted inspections as a teacher and i welcome this move .
at the moment schools get weeks of notice and the ' preparations begin ' - new materials are bought , flowers appear , pupils ' bribed ' to behave .
i have even seen the ' worst students ' disappear on ' work experience ' during ofsted week !
let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out .
mark j , england there should be no warning period at all .
only through inspectors seeing what these schools are really like will they improve .
teachers who are organised and professional should n't worry because they have already got their act together .
as a student i had a few teachers who were almost as " slap dash " as the students .
this sort of " continuous assessment " will improve my children 's education .

evaxon to alison of leeds , your friend is as you say under pressure to make things seem better than they really are !
does he honestly believe that will fool the inspectors -lrb- many of whom are former teachers themselves and probably also tried the same thing .
as all schools would have published their examination results and the league tables are in the national and often local newspapers do not the inspectors know the true position !
john , london a friend of mine is a teacher , whose school is being inspected this week .
he 's under pressure to make it appear that things are better than they are normally .
snap inspections would encourage schools to maintain a constant level of high standards , rather than just focussing it for a week every few years .
i 'm sure that teacher work very hard to do their best , but where there are problems these need to be highlighted , not covered up for the inspections .
alison , leeds , uk the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time paul j-w , england , uk there is a body of people that has been overlooked in this new proposal , that of the school governors .
the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time .
the amount of work governors will be required to do , at a time when the leas are already increasing the number of duties governors are expected to carry out would be considerable .
after all we are only volunteers , and under the new ofsted structure governors will also be more closely inspected .
this means that the school may pass as outstanding , but if the governors fail one tick box , the school then fails .
paul j-w , england , uk i think there should be no notice at all for inspections , and the schools should not be able to prepare for one by expecting them every three years .
ofsted would then quickly find out how much of the pointless form filling is quietly ignored by most teachers , and just how badly behaved pupils are .
mark blackman , london it is difficult to see whether this will work until it has happened .
it is a good idea to have inspections more often , shorter inspections may mean that they will see less .
it will also be more effective if the schools can not prepare too much for the inspections , as it means that the inspectors will not see the school as it normally is .
helen , england snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools simon canfer , swindon snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools .
why should anyone believe the current system gives a real picture of teaching when the lessons taught are atypical ?
snap inspections would also reduce stress on teacher 's families who currently suffer in the long run up to inspections .
more frequent inspections would also give a more up-to-date picture of schools ; what use to me , as a parent , is a 1999 inspection report in 2004 ?
simon canfer , swindon uk i remember when the school inspectors came when i was in high school , they were not given a true picture at all , everywhere was freshly painted , paintings went up on the walls , there were flowers in tubs etc etc and everyone was threatened to be on their best behaviour .
spot checks with no notice would give a real picture of how schools are not the ' rose tinted ' view that the inspectors are given when schools are warned of a visit liz , cardiff please do not immediately assume that all teachers are good teachers .
my husband sometimes helps neighbours with their science homework and he actually shrieks in horror how they are being taught .
he just wonders how these teachers get away with it ?
inspections should be as often as possible to get rid of hopeless individuals teaching our children .
inga , england let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out mark j , england i have been through two ofsted inspections as a teacher and i welcome this move .
at the moment schools get weeks of notice and the ' preparations begin ' - new materials are bought , flowers appear , pupils ' bribed ' to behave .
i have even seen the ' worst students ' disappear on ' work experience ' during ofsted week !
let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out .
mark j , england there should be no warning period at all .
only through inspectors seeing what these schools are really like will they improve .
teachers who are organised and professional should n't worry because they have already got their act together .
as a student i had a few teachers who were almost as " slap dash " as the students .
this sort of " continuous assessment " will improve my children 's education .
stephen , uk ' those that can , teach .
those that ca n't become ofsted inspectors ' .
the teachers on the front line have to deal with the pressures of uncontrollable kids and teach at the same time .
i would love to see some of those ofsted inspectors have a go at teaching rather than just undermine committed teachers by making a critical judgement on the basis of observing one lesson .
if this happens i predict it will just result in more experienced and dedicated teachers leaving the profession tim , bromley , uk good idea .
our college is being inspected in march , and we 've known about it for months .
schools and colleges use the months of notice to put on a show , papering over cracks in order to pass inspection .
the entire system is a sham .
figures show that the students are the ones who suffer most , with noticeably lower grades during inspection years .
the amount of pointless paperwork -lrb- self assessment reports etc -rrb- required is causing enormous stress to staff who would much rather be teaching their students .
the entire inspection grading system would have to be overhauled too , as the government realise how little they have actually been learning about schools over the years .
rich , hants , uk as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good tim benson , london financial expediency rather than educational reform is powering this initiative .
the present system is costing many millions a year to tell us , all but a tiny proportion of schools are doing well .
save even more , scrap the system .
as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good .
tim benson , london i do n't feel that a snap inspection from ofsted will provide more up-to-date information for parents .
it will just increase pressure on overworked , stressed teachers .
this policy can do no good , only harm and drive away even more teachers from an already overstretched and depleted workforce .
m taylor , oldham , lancs if teachers are doing their jobs properly there should be no reason for them to feel stressed .
the ones who are just no good or lazy will be found out .
ideally no notice at all should be given - inspectors should just turn up .
jp , london what about having one day a year when the government or one of its quangos does n't decide to launch yet another change or half-baked idea just to show that they are alive .
it 's just another publicity stunt .
leave education alone for a time and instead reform the long holidays , generous unscrutinised expenses and extra incomes politicians get .
tom smith , worcs , england inspectors should just turn up stuart , romford they would only work if there was no notice given to the schools .
inspectors should just turn up and they would really see what a disgrace our education system is under new labour .
giving them notice will only allow the school heads to close shop and paint a rosy picture .
stuart , romford , uk the reason why ofsted inspections are so frightening for teachers is that their usual lessons are not acceptable for these inspections and lessons during an ofsted inspection are taught to a much higher standard than usual lessons .
it would in fact be impossible for teachers to teach to this standard for every lesson and on every day .
snap inspections will show teachers giving much more ' normal ' lessons and this should be acceptable .
sarah cotter , woodbridge i think it 's a fantastic idea !
it will stop schools in the run up of inspections deciding to redecorate the school like they did when we had out inspection .
the outcome of the inspection is meant to offer advice and help the school improve and they will get a more honest approach if the school are caught off guard rather than getting weeks of warning .
louise , surrey so what will be the problem with having these " shorter sharper " inspections .
teachers are no different than me or any other person who works .
our performance is being assessed on a regular basis without any special arrangements .
oh , and our establishment is under constant scrutiny by our customers - if we fail " inspection " then we go out of business and have no jobs to go to , a school fails an inspection and they get some free remedial treatment from the shareholders -lrb- taxpayers -rrb- .
no sympathy here i 'm afraid .
trevor , colchester , uk what will mr bell suggest next ?
perhaps giving students only two days notice of an a-level exam ?
brian rudd , newport pagnell , bucks this is a money-saving exercise and nothing whatever to do with standards .
the increased frequency and reduced warning given for , inspections can only increase the pressure on teachers without any prospect that it will lead to higher standards .
it is typical of this government that it changes policies and guidelines on a regular basis to give the impression of active government , but actually leaves the poor teachers reeling , demoralised and overworked .
these are not weapons inspections imposed on rogue states , they are meant to assist schools in the improvements that they honestly wish to make .
frank , london , uk i used to work for a well known supermarket who would be ' tipped off ' that the health inspectors coming .
what 's the point of telling someone they are going to be inspected if the motive is improve quality .
phillip ellis , uk so , " there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny . "
what 's wrong with that ?

schools in england could face more frequent , " light-touch " inspections , says ofsted chief david bell .
this could lead to inspections every three years rather than the current six .
mr bell has claimed that " shorter , sharper " inspections would provide parents with more up-to-date information as well as saving schools up to 10 weeks of anxious preparation .
however there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny .
will snap school inspections raise standards ?
or will they increase pressure on both teachers and students ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly lou , west midlands every three years is not often at all .
if schools are run well they should be worried of feel under scrutiny .
i think school should be inspected without any prior warning each year .
when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly .
lessons were also planned in advance of the inspections .
lou , west midlands i 'm a teacher and i would love snap inspections .
at the moment we get far too much warning .
we are due to have the inspectors in march and the management have spent tens of thousands of pounds on all sorts of trivial rubbish , to smarten the place up in the hope that they are going to be impressed with new carpets and plastic plants .
let the inspectorate see what the place is really like all the year round !
anon , scotland no !
it will be further money wasted .
new initiatives need to be put in place - not more inspections .
james , dorset , uk a much better idea than giving a school days to prepare - our school used to change everything when ofsted came calling , we planned in advance making the whole thing stupid and pointless .
tom , england we are talking about the future of our children here .
the teachers must come second in this and be prepared to take a little more stress if it keeps standards up .
do n't teachers give their pupils snap tests from time to time ?
gary gatter , london , uk my wife is a teacher and it 's clear that the main bugbear with inspections is the need to have reams of paperwork that normally never happen .
she 'll now have to waste hours on a regular basis preparing unnecessary papers on the off-chance that mr ofsted will drop in .
it 's not that the coursework is unstructured it 's just that an experienced teacher knows where her pupils are at and what 's needed without having to write it down all the time .
jonathan , wiltshire teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system christine , uk as a teacher i much favour the short notice inspections .
with all the advance warning we get now , the inspected lessons become overprepared and unnatural and i personally consider myself a worse teacher when inspected than under normal circumstances .
teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system and something has to be wrong with a system where parents of disruptive children are encouraged to keep their kids out of school during inspection week .
christine , uk whilst i understand the comments made that good teachers have nothing to fear , the converse is actually true .
good teachers often work on their own professional initiative and refuse to buckle to the ridiculous paperwork imposed by a centralised control .
ofsted have , for many years , been the shocktroops of the government , seeing that irrelevant targets are set and mountains of bureaucracy are filled in .
perniciously , ofsted sees as successful those who subject themselves to centralised control .
on this basis , good , independent and professional teachers are often classified as failing .
chris , yorks , uk in all honesty , why are schools not up to inspection standards every day ?
any respectable school will reach the inspective standard and maintain the level to present a better image for the school , leaving schools that do not meet the current standard to realistically seek a leadership restructure .
peter richards , port talbot , wales schools would present a far truer picture sally , spalding as a teacher i think this is an excellent idea as schools would present a far truer picture .
it may be that all the paperwork would not be up to date , but if the children are being well taught , that surely , is more important .
if inspectors see the amount of paperwork outstanding at school after school , and hear the same reasons given , there may even be an incentive to limit this largely pointless exercise .
and if schools are in a poor state of repair , then it will be shown that more needs to be given in funding .
sally , spalding i note with great sadness , the thoroughly negative stance and attitude that many of the comments in this section have towards teachers and schools .
i wish some parents and members of the public would accept that there are a great many teachers who work hard , work consistently and enjoy their job .
a great many of us do a fantastic job and provide our pupils with superb levels of teaching and learning .
for goodness sake - give us a break ! !
mark , newcastle , uk as a nursing home manager , i had to be prepared for unannounced inspections day or night from the local health authority .
we had no notice at all of these inspections , and it meant standards had to be consistent .
if teachers are such consummate professionals , and all of their spare time is used for lesson preparation and marking as they claim , then they will have nothing to fear from any inspection !
alun thomas , swansea , wales i have one hours notice when our company 's directors have been rumoured to be on their way .
i have to maintain standards all the time - why should teachers not be - they do get well paid for it and despite the moaning they get more than me !
tony humphreys , prestatyn , wales my college has just had its ofsted inspection and a day before they came we had new chairs , interactive wipe boards , new licks of paint which was purely for the inspectors .
the college also told a friend of mines son not to turn up to lessons during the week so that they could fiddle the books and the inspectors would n't know .
i think snap inspections will benefit both pupils ' and staff .
scott , middlesbrough if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear kate , uk i believe that there should be no warnings of an inspection .
it is what happens on a day-to-day basis in schools and colleges that is important , not what can be produced ' royal visit ' style when an inspection is known to be happening .
i work in education and i have seen how the picture can be falsified for the benefit of inspectors .
if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear .
kate , uk if snap inspections were to start tomorrow then there would be uproar as few schools would gain anywhere near the levels found at the moment .
the problem rarely lies with the school though .
how can the average teacher be expected to provide the best possible education to their class when they are snowed under by mountains of pointless paperwork , are chronically under funded in many areas and have no effective means of stopping any troublemakers that they may have in their class .
simon , uk i work at a school that has ofsted in this week .
over the last few weeks as the teachers were preparing for the inspection it was clear that things were being improved purely for the inspectors , and therefore they are not seeing a true picture of how the school is - they 're seeing an idealised " well , this is what we 'd like to be like " version .
i feel that spot checks would be far more effective - at least then ofsted get a true picture !
j , london , uk if teachers feel that these new inspections will increase pressure on them they are not doing their job properly .
a school inspection is merely there to check that schools are adhering to preset standards , if schools are , they will have no problems .
yes it will raise standards as schools should maintain standards all the time rather than rushing to learn them in the weeks before an ofsted visit .
sg , uk let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
dan , lancaster , uk yes why not !
drive more teachers out of the classroom and into the doctor 's waiting room !
let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
the whole system is wrong to start with , do n't make it worse .
dan , lancaster , uk i think that the best way to do it would be surprise inspections whenever and wherever .
if they are not scheduled and the schools are not prepared for it then it will give a much better indication as to how well the school is being run .
making them shorter is n't such a good idea .
i do n't think a shorter visit will be able to gather enough information to form a good report on how well the school is doing .
evaxon to alison of leeds , your friend is as you say under pressure to make things seem better than they really are !
does he honestly believe that will fool the inspectors -lrb- many of whom are former teachers themselves and probably also tried the same thing .
as all schools would have published their examination results and the league tables are in the national and often local newspapers do not the inspectors know the true position !

sally , spalding i note with great sadness , the thoroughly negative stance and attitude that many of the comments in this section have towards teachers and schools .
i wish some parents and members of the public would accept that there are a great many teachers who work hard , work consistently and enjoy their job .
a great many of us do a fantastic job and provide our pupils with superb levels of teaching and learning .
for goodness sake - give us a break ! !
mark , newcastle , uk as a nursing home manager , i had to be prepared for unannounced inspections day or night from the local health authority .
we had no notice at all of these inspections , and it meant standards had to be consistent .
if teachers are such consummate professionals , and all of their spare time is used for lesson preparation and marking as they claim , then they will have nothing to fear from any inspection !
alun thomas , swansea , wales i have one hours notice when our company 's directors have been rumoured to be on their way .
i have to maintain standards all the time - why should teachers not be - they do get well paid for it and despite the moaning they get more than me !
tony humphreys , prestatyn , wales my college has just had its ofsted inspection and a day before they came we had new chairs , interactive wipe boards , new licks of paint which was purely for the inspectors .
the college also told a friend of mines son not to turn up to lessons during the week so that they could fiddle the books and the inspectors would n't know .
i think snap inspections will benefit both pupils ' and staff .
scott , middlesbrough if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear kate , uk i believe that there should be no warnings of an inspection .
it is what happens on a day-to-day basis in schools and colleges that is important , not what can be produced ' royal visit ' style when an inspection is known to be happening .
i work in education and i have seen how the picture can be falsified for the benefit of inspectors .
if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear .
kate , uk if snap inspections were to start tomorrow then there would be uproar as few schools would gain anywhere near the levels found at the moment .
the problem rarely lies with the school though .
how can the average teacher be expected to provide the best possible education to their class when they are snowed under by mountains of pointless paperwork , are chronically under funded in many areas and have no effective means of stopping any troublemakers that they may have in their class .
simon , uk i work at a school that has ofsted in this week .
over the last few weeks as the teachers were preparing for the inspection it was clear that things were being improved purely for the inspectors , and therefore they are not seeing a true picture of how the school is - they 're seeing an idealised " well , this is what we 'd like to be like " version .
i feel that spot checks would be far more effective - at least then ofsted get a true picture !
j , london , uk if teachers feel that these new inspections will increase pressure on them they are not doing their job properly .
a school inspection is merely there to check that schools are adhering to preset standards , if schools are , they will have no problems .
yes it will raise standards as schools should maintain standards all the time rather than rushing to learn them in the weeks before an ofsted visit .
sg , uk let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
dan , lancaster , uk yes why not !
drive more teachers out of the classroom and into the doctor 's waiting room !
let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
the whole system is wrong to start with , do n't make it worse .
dan , lancaster , uk i think that the best way to do it would be surprise inspections whenever and wherever .
if they are not scheduled and the schools are not prepared for it then it will give a much better indication as to how well the school is being run .
making them shorter is n't such a good idea .
i do n't think a shorter visit will be able to gather enough information to form a good report on how well the school is doing .
evaxon to alison of leeds , your friend is as you say under pressure to make things seem better than they really are !
does he honestly believe that will fool the inspectors -lrb- many of whom are former teachers themselves and probably also tried the same thing .
as all schools would have published their examination results and the league tables are in the national and often local newspapers do not the inspectors know the true position !
john , london a friend of mine is a teacher , whose school is being inspected this week .
he 's under pressure to make it appear that things are better than they are normally .
snap inspections would encourage schools to maintain a constant level of high standards , rather than just focussing it for a week every few years .
i 'm sure that teacher work very hard to do their best , but where there are problems these need to be highlighted , not covered up for the inspections .
alison , leeds , uk the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time paul j-w , england , uk there is a body of people that has been overlooked in this new proposal , that of the school governors .
the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time .
the amount of work governors will be required to do , at a time when the leas are already increasing the number of duties governors are expected to carry out would be considerable .
after all we are only volunteers , and under the new ofsted structure governors will also be more closely inspected .
this means that the school may pass as outstanding , but if the governors fail one tick box , the school then fails .
paul j-w , england , uk i think there should be no notice at all for inspections , and the schools should not be able to prepare for one by expecting them every three years .
ofsted would then quickly find out how much of the pointless form filling is quietly ignored by most teachers , and just how badly behaved pupils are .
mark blackman , london it is difficult to see whether this will work until it has happened .
it is a good idea to have inspections more often , shorter inspections may mean that they will see less .
it will also be more effective if the schools can not prepare too much for the inspections , as it means that the inspectors will not see the school as it normally is .
helen , england snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools simon canfer , swindon snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools .
why should anyone believe the current system gives a real picture of teaching when the lessons taught are atypical ?
snap inspections would also reduce stress on teacher 's families who currently suffer in the long run up to inspections .
more frequent inspections would also give a more up-to-date picture of schools ; what use to me , as a parent , is a 1999 inspection report in 2004 ?
simon canfer , swindon uk i remember when the school inspectors came when i was in high school , they were not given a true picture at all , everywhere was freshly painted , paintings went up on the walls , there were flowers in tubs etc etc and everyone was threatened to be on their best behaviour .
spot checks with no notice would give a real picture of how schools are not the ' rose tinted ' view that the inspectors are given when schools are warned of a visit liz , cardiff please do not immediately assume that all teachers are good teachers .
my husband sometimes helps neighbours with their science homework and he actually shrieks in horror how they are being taught .
he just wonders how these teachers get away with it ?
inspections should be as often as possible to get rid of hopeless individuals teaching our children .
inga , england let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out mark j , england i have been through two ofsted inspections as a teacher and i welcome this move .
at the moment schools get weeks of notice and the ' preparations begin ' - new materials are bought , flowers appear , pupils ' bribed ' to behave .
i have even seen the ' worst students ' disappear on ' work experience ' during ofsted week !
let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out .
mark j , england there should be no warning period at all .
only through inspectors seeing what these schools are really like will they improve .
teachers who are organised and professional should n't worry because they have already got their act together .
as a student i had a few teachers who were almost as " slap dash " as the students .
this sort of " continuous assessment " will improve my children 's education .
stephen , uk ' those that can , teach .
those that ca n't become ofsted inspectors ' .
the teachers on the front line have to deal with the pressures of uncontrollable kids and teach at the same time .
i would love to see some of those ofsted inspectors have a go at teaching rather than just undermine committed teachers by making a critical judgement on the basis of observing one lesson .
if this happens i predict it will just result in more experienced and dedicated teachers leaving the profession tim , bromley , uk good idea .
our college is being inspected in march , and we 've known about it for months .
schools and colleges use the months of notice to put on a show , papering over cracks in order to pass inspection .
the entire system is a sham .
figures show that the students are the ones who suffer most , with noticeably lower grades during inspection years .
the amount of pointless paperwork -lrb- self assessment reports etc -rrb- required is causing enormous stress to staff who would much rather be teaching their students .
the entire inspection grading system would have to be overhauled too , as the government realise how little they have actually been learning about schools over the years .
rich , hants , uk as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good tim benson , london financial expediency rather than educational reform is powering this initiative .
the present system is costing many millions a year to tell us , all but a tiny proportion of schools are doing well .
save even more , scrap the system .
as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good .
tim benson , london i do n't feel that a snap inspection from ofsted will provide more up-to-date information for parents .
it will just increase pressure on overworked , stressed teachers .
this policy can do no good , only harm and drive away even more teachers from an already overstretched and depleted workforce .
m taylor , oldham , lancs if teachers are doing their jobs properly there should be no reason for them to feel stressed .
the ones who are just no good or lazy will be found out .
ideally no notice at all should be given - inspectors should just turn up .
jp , london what about having one day a year when the government or one of its quangos does n't decide to launch yet another change or half-baked idea just to show that they are alive .
it 's just another publicity stunt .
leave education alone for a time and instead reform the long holidays , generous unscrutinised expenses and extra incomes politicians get .
tom smith , worcs , england inspectors should just turn up stuart , romford they would only work if there was no notice given to the schools .
inspectors should just turn up and they would really see what a disgrace our education system is under new labour .
giving them notice will only allow the school heads to close shop and paint a rosy picture .
stuart , romford , uk the reason why ofsted inspections are so frightening for teachers is that their usual lessons are not acceptable for these inspections and lessons during an ofsted inspection are taught to a much higher standard than usual lessons .
it would in fact be impossible for teachers to teach to this standard for every lesson and on every day .
snap inspections will show teachers giving much more ' normal ' lessons and this should be acceptable .
sarah cotter , woodbridge i think it 's a fantastic idea !
it will stop schools in the run up of inspections deciding to redecorate the school like they did when we had out inspection .
the outcome of the inspection is meant to offer advice and help the school improve and they will get a more honest approach if the school are caught off guard rather than getting weeks of warning .
louise , surrey so what will be the problem with having these " shorter sharper " inspections .
teachers are no different than me or any other person who works .
our performance is being assessed on a regular basis without any special arrangements .
oh , and our establishment is under constant scrutiny by our customers - if we fail " inspection " then we go out of business and have no jobs to go to , a school fails an inspection and they get some free remedial treatment from the shareholders -lrb- taxpayers -rrb- .
no sympathy here i 'm afraid .
trevor , colchester , uk what will mr bell suggest next ?
perhaps giving students only two days notice of an a-level exam ?
brian rudd , newport pagnell , bucks this is a money-saving exercise and nothing whatever to do with standards .
the increased frequency and reduced warning given for , inspections can only increase the pressure on teachers without any prospect that it will lead to higher standards .
it is typical of this government that it changes policies and guidelines on a regular basis to give the impression of active government , but actually leaves the poor teachers reeling , demoralised and overworked .
these are not weapons inspections imposed on rogue states , they are meant to assist schools in the improvements that they honestly wish to make .
frank , london , uk i used to work for a well known supermarket who would be ' tipped off ' that the health inspectors coming .
what 's the point of telling someone they are going to be inspected if the motive is improve quality .
phillip ellis , uk so , " there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny . "
what 's wrong with that ?

schools in england could face more frequent , " light-touch " inspections , says ofsted chief david bell .
this could lead to inspections every three years rather than the current six .
mr bell has claimed that " shorter , sharper " inspections would provide parents with more up-to-date information as well as saving schools up to 10 weeks of anxious preparation .
however there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny .
will snap school inspections raise standards ?
or will they increase pressure on both teachers and students ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly lou , west midlands every three years is not often at all .
if schools are run well they should be worried of feel under scrutiny .
i think school should be inspected without any prior warning each year .
when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly .
lessons were also planned in advance of the inspections .
lou , west midlands i 'm a teacher and i would love snap inspections .
at the moment we get far too much warning .
we are due to have the inspectors in march and the management have spent tens of thousands of pounds on all sorts of trivial rubbish , to smarten the place up in the hope that they are going to be impressed with new carpets and plastic plants .
let the inspectorate see what the place is really like all the year round !
anon , scotland no !
it will be further money wasted .
new initiatives need to be put in place - not more inspections .
james , dorset , uk a much better idea than giving a school days to prepare - our school used to change everything when ofsted came calling , we planned in advance making the whole thing stupid and pointless .
tom , england we are talking about the future of our children here .
the teachers must come second in this and be prepared to take a little more stress if it keeps standards up .
do n't teachers give their pupils snap tests from time to time ?
gary gatter , london , uk my wife is a teacher and it 's clear that the main bugbear with inspections is the need to have reams of paperwork that normally never happen .
she 'll now have to waste hours on a regular basis preparing unnecessary papers on the off-chance that mr ofsted will drop in .
it 's not that the coursework is unstructured it 's just that an experienced teacher knows where her pupils are at and what 's needed without having to write it down all the time .
jonathan , wiltshire teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system christine , uk as a teacher i much favour the short notice inspections .
with all the advance warning we get now , the inspected lessons become overprepared and unnatural and i personally consider myself a worse teacher when inspected than under normal circumstances .
teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system and something has to be wrong with a system where parents of disruptive children are encouraged to keep their kids out of school during inspection week .
christine , uk whilst i understand the comments made that good teachers have nothing to fear , the converse is actually true .
good teachers often work on their own professional initiative and refuse to buckle to the ridiculous paperwork imposed by a centralised control .
ofsted have , for many years , been the shocktroops of the government , seeing that irrelevant targets are set and mountains of bureaucracy are filled in .
perniciously , ofsted sees as successful those who subject themselves to centralised control .
on this basis , good , independent and professional teachers are often classified as failing .
chris , yorks , uk in all honesty , why are schools not up to inspection standards every day ?
any respectable school will reach the inspective standard and maintain the level to present a better image for the school , leaving schools that do not meet the current standard to realistically seek a leadership restructure .
peter richards , port talbot , wales schools would present a far truer picture sally , spalding as a teacher i think this is an excellent idea as schools would present a far truer picture .
it may be that all the paperwork would not be up to date , but if the children are being well taught , that surely , is more important .
if inspectors see the amount of paperwork outstanding at school after school , and hear the same reasons given , there may even be an incentive to limit this largely pointless exercise .
and if schools are in a poor state of repair , then it will be shown that more needs to be given in funding .
sally , spalding i note with great sadness , the thoroughly negative stance and attitude that many of the comments in this section have towards teachers and schools .

mr bell has claimed that " shorter , sharper " inspections would provide parents with more up-to-date information as well as saving schools up to 10 weeks of anxious preparation .
however there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny .
will snap school inspections raise standards ?
or will they increase pressure on both teachers and students ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly lou , west midlands every three years is not often at all .
if schools are run well they should be worried of feel under scrutiny .
i think school should be inspected without any prior warning each year .
when i was at school and the inspectors were due in we were warned to behave and sit quietly .
lessons were also planned in advance of the inspections .
lou , west midlands i 'm a teacher and i would love snap inspections .
at the moment we get far too much warning .
we are due to have the inspectors in march and the management have spent tens of thousands of pounds on all sorts of trivial rubbish , to smarten the place up in the hope that they are going to be impressed with new carpets and plastic plants .
let the inspectorate see what the place is really like all the year round !
anon , scotland no !
it will be further money wasted .
new initiatives need to be put in place - not more inspections .
james , dorset , uk a much better idea than giving a school days to prepare - our school used to change everything when ofsted came calling , we planned in advance making the whole thing stupid and pointless .
tom , england we are talking about the future of our children here .
the teachers must come second in this and be prepared to take a little more stress if it keeps standards up .
do n't teachers give their pupils snap tests from time to time ?
gary gatter , london , uk my wife is a teacher and it 's clear that the main bugbear with inspections is the need to have reams of paperwork that normally never happen .
she 'll now have to waste hours on a regular basis preparing unnecessary papers on the off-chance that mr ofsted will drop in .
it 's not that the coursework is unstructured it 's just that an experienced teacher knows where her pupils are at and what 's needed without having to write it down all the time .
jonathan , wiltshire teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system christine , uk as a teacher i much favour the short notice inspections .
with all the advance warning we get now , the inspected lessons become overprepared and unnatural and i personally consider myself a worse teacher when inspected than under normal circumstances .
teachers and students are put under far too much pressure under the current system and something has to be wrong with a system where parents of disruptive children are encouraged to keep their kids out of school during inspection week .
christine , uk whilst i understand the comments made that good teachers have nothing to fear , the converse is actually true .
good teachers often work on their own professional initiative and refuse to buckle to the ridiculous paperwork imposed by a centralised control .
ofsted have , for many years , been the shocktroops of the government , seeing that irrelevant targets are set and mountains of bureaucracy are filled in .
perniciously , ofsted sees as successful those who subject themselves to centralised control .
on this basis , good , independent and professional teachers are often classified as failing .
chris , yorks , uk in all honesty , why are schools not up to inspection standards every day ?
any respectable school will reach the inspective standard and maintain the level to present a better image for the school , leaving schools that do not meet the current standard to realistically seek a leadership restructure .
peter richards , port talbot , wales schools would present a far truer picture sally , spalding as a teacher i think this is an excellent idea as schools would present a far truer picture .
it may be that all the paperwork would not be up to date , but if the children are being well taught , that surely , is more important .
if inspectors see the amount of paperwork outstanding at school after school , and hear the same reasons given , there may even be an incentive to limit this largely pointless exercise .
and if schools are in a poor state of repair , then it will be shown that more needs to be given in funding .
sally , spalding i note with great sadness , the thoroughly negative stance and attitude that many of the comments in this section have towards teachers and schools .
i wish some parents and members of the public would accept that there are a great many teachers who work hard , work consistently and enjoy their job .
a great many of us do a fantastic job and provide our pupils with superb levels of teaching and learning .
for goodness sake - give us a break ! !
mark , newcastle , uk as a nursing home manager , i had to be prepared for unannounced inspections day or night from the local health authority .
we had no notice at all of these inspections , and it meant standards had to be consistent .
if teachers are such consummate professionals , and all of their spare time is used for lesson preparation and marking as they claim , then they will have nothing to fear from any inspection !
alun thomas , swansea , wales i have one hours notice when our company 's directors have been rumoured to be on their way .
i have to maintain standards all the time - why should teachers not be - they do get well paid for it and despite the moaning they get more than me !
tony humphreys , prestatyn , wales my college has just had its ofsted inspection and a day before they came we had new chairs , interactive wipe boards , new licks of paint which was purely for the inspectors .
the college also told a friend of mines son not to turn up to lessons during the week so that they could fiddle the books and the inspectors would n't know .
i think snap inspections will benefit both pupils ' and staff .
scott , middlesbrough if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear kate , uk i believe that there should be no warnings of an inspection .
it is what happens on a day-to-day basis in schools and colleges that is important , not what can be produced ' royal visit ' style when an inspection is known to be happening .
i work in education and i have seen how the picture can be falsified for the benefit of inspectors .
if schools are working to a high standard they should have nothing to fear .
kate , uk if snap inspections were to start tomorrow then there would be uproar as few schools would gain anywhere near the levels found at the moment .
the problem rarely lies with the school though .
how can the average teacher be expected to provide the best possible education to their class when they are snowed under by mountains of pointless paperwork , are chronically under funded in many areas and have no effective means of stopping any troublemakers that they may have in their class .
simon , uk i work at a school that has ofsted in this week .
over the last few weeks as the teachers were preparing for the inspection it was clear that things were being improved purely for the inspectors , and therefore they are not seeing a true picture of how the school is - they 're seeing an idealised " well , this is what we 'd like to be like " version .
i feel that spot checks would be far more effective - at least then ofsted get a true picture !
j , london , uk if teachers feel that these new inspections will increase pressure on them they are not doing their job properly .
a school inspection is merely there to check that schools are adhering to preset standards , if schools are , they will have no problems .
yes it will raise standards as schools should maintain standards all the time rather than rushing to learn them in the weeks before an ofsted visit .
sg , uk let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
dan , lancaster , uk yes why not !
drive more teachers out of the classroom and into the doctor 's waiting room !
let 's hope that mr bell is prepared to deal with more teachers on the sick because of stress !
the whole system is wrong to start with , do n't make it worse .
dan , lancaster , uk i think that the best way to do it would be surprise inspections whenever and wherever .
if they are not scheduled and the schools are not prepared for it then it will give a much better indication as to how well the school is being run .
making them shorter is n't such a good idea .
i do n't think a shorter visit will be able to gather enough information to form a good report on how well the school is doing .
evaxon to alison of leeds , your friend is as you say under pressure to make things seem better than they really are !
does he honestly believe that will fool the inspectors -lrb- many of whom are former teachers themselves and probably also tried the same thing .
as all schools would have published their examination results and the league tables are in the national and often local newspapers do not the inspectors know the true position !
john , london a friend of mine is a teacher , whose school is being inspected this week .
he 's under pressure to make it appear that things are better than they are normally .
snap inspections would encourage schools to maintain a constant level of high standards , rather than just focussing it for a week every few years .
i 'm sure that teacher work very hard to do their best , but where there are problems these need to be highlighted , not covered up for the inspections .
alison , leeds , uk the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time paul j-w , england , uk there is a body of people that has been overlooked in this new proposal , that of the school governors .
the impact of an ofsted inspection is already stressful enough without the threat of inspections at any time .
the amount of work governors will be required to do , at a time when the leas are already increasing the number of duties governors are expected to carry out would be considerable .
after all we are only volunteers , and under the new ofsted structure governors will also be more closely inspected .
this means that the school may pass as outstanding , but if the governors fail one tick box , the school then fails .
paul j-w , england , uk i think there should be no notice at all for inspections , and the schools should not be able to prepare for one by expecting them every three years .
ofsted would then quickly find out how much of the pointless form filling is quietly ignored by most teachers , and just how badly behaved pupils are .
mark blackman , london it is difficult to see whether this will work until it has happened .
it is a good idea to have inspections more often , shorter inspections may mean that they will see less .
it will also be more effective if the schools can not prepare too much for the inspections , as it means that the inspectors will not see the school as it normally is .
helen , england snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools simon canfer , swindon snap inspections can only help get a more real picture of schools .
why should anyone believe the current system gives a real picture of teaching when the lessons taught are atypical ?
snap inspections would also reduce stress on teacher 's families who currently suffer in the long run up to inspections .
more frequent inspections would also give a more up-to-date picture of schools ; what use to me , as a parent , is a 1999 inspection report in 2004 ?
simon canfer , swindon uk i remember when the school inspectors came when i was in high school , they were not given a true picture at all , everywhere was freshly painted , paintings went up on the walls , there were flowers in tubs etc etc and everyone was threatened to be on their best behaviour .
spot checks with no notice would give a real picture of how schools are not the ' rose tinted ' view that the inspectors are given when schools are warned of a visit liz , cardiff please do not immediately assume that all teachers are good teachers .
my husband sometimes helps neighbours with their science homework and he actually shrieks in horror how they are being taught .
he just wonders how these teachers get away with it ?
inspections should be as often as possible to get rid of hopeless individuals teaching our children .
inga , england let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out mark j , england i have been through two ofsted inspections as a teacher and i welcome this move .
at the moment schools get weeks of notice and the ' preparations begin ' - new materials are bought , flowers appear , pupils ' bribed ' to behave .
i have even seen the ' worst students ' disappear on ' work experience ' during ofsted week !
let inspectors see schools as they are week in week out .
mark j , england there should be no warning period at all .
only through inspectors seeing what these schools are really like will they improve .
teachers who are organised and professional should n't worry because they have already got their act together .
as a student i had a few teachers who were almost as " slap dash " as the students .
this sort of " continuous assessment " will improve my children 's education .
stephen , uk ' those that can , teach .
those that ca n't become ofsted inspectors ' .
the teachers on the front line have to deal with the pressures of uncontrollable kids and teach at the same time .
i would love to see some of those ofsted inspectors have a go at teaching rather than just undermine committed teachers by making a critical judgement on the basis of observing one lesson .
if this happens i predict it will just result in more experienced and dedicated teachers leaving the profession tim , bromley , uk good idea .
our college is being inspected in march , and we 've known about it for months .
schools and colleges use the months of notice to put on a show , papering over cracks in order to pass inspection .
the entire system is a sham .
figures show that the students are the ones who suffer most , with noticeably lower grades during inspection years .
the amount of pointless paperwork -lrb- self assessment reports etc -rrb- required is causing enormous stress to staff who would much rather be teaching their students .
the entire inspection grading system would have to be overhauled too , as the government realise how little they have actually been learning about schools over the years .
rich , hants , uk as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good tim benson , london financial expediency rather than educational reform is powering this initiative .
the present system is costing many millions a year to tell us , all but a tiny proportion of schools are doing well .
save even more , scrap the system .
as parents we know on the playground if the school is any good .
tim benson , london i do n't feel that a snap inspection from ofsted will provide more up-to-date information for parents .
it will just increase pressure on overworked , stressed teachers .
this policy can do no good , only harm and drive away even more teachers from an already overstretched and depleted workforce .
m taylor , oldham , lancs if teachers are doing their jobs properly there should be no reason for them to feel stressed .
the ones who are just no good or lazy will be found out .
ideally no notice at all should be given - inspectors should just turn up .
jp , london what about having one day a year when the government or one of its quangos does n't decide to launch yet another change or half-baked idea just to show that they are alive .
it 's just another publicity stunt .
leave education alone for a time and instead reform the long holidays , generous unscrutinised expenses and extra incomes politicians get .
tom smith , worcs , england inspectors should just turn up stuart , romford they would only work if there was no notice given to the schools .
inspectors should just turn up and they would really see what a disgrace our education system is under new labour .
giving them notice will only allow the school heads to close shop and paint a rosy picture .
stuart , romford , uk the reason why ofsted inspections are so frightening for teachers is that their usual lessons are not acceptable for these inspections and lessons during an ofsted inspection are taught to a much higher standard than usual lessons .
it would in fact be impossible for teachers to teach to this standard for every lesson and on every day .
snap inspections will show teachers giving much more ' normal ' lessons and this should be acceptable .
sarah cotter , woodbridge i think it 's a fantastic idea !
it will stop schools in the run up of inspections deciding to redecorate the school like they did when we had out inspection .
the outcome of the inspection is meant to offer advice and help the school improve and they will get a more honest approach if the school are caught off guard rather than getting weeks of warning .
louise , surrey so what will be the problem with having these " shorter sharper " inspections .
teachers are no different than me or any other person who works .
our performance is being assessed on a regular basis without any special arrangements .
oh , and our establishment is under constant scrutiny by our customers - if we fail " inspection " then we go out of business and have no jobs to go to , a school fails an inspection and they get some free remedial treatment from the shareholders -lrb- taxpayers -rrb- .
no sympathy here i 'm afraid .
trevor , colchester , uk what will mr bell suggest next ?
perhaps giving students only two days notice of an a-level exam ?
brian rudd , newport pagnell , bucks this is a money-saving exercise and nothing whatever to do with standards .
the increased frequency and reduced warning given for , inspections can only increase the pressure on teachers without any prospect that it will lead to higher standards .
it is typical of this government that it changes policies and guidelines on a regular basis to give the impression of active government , but actually leaves the poor teachers reeling , demoralised and overworked .
these are not weapons inspections imposed on rogue states , they are meant to assist schools in the improvements that they honestly wish to make .
frank , london , uk i used to work for a well known supermarket who would be ' tipped off ' that the health inspectors coming .
what 's the point of telling someone they are going to be inspected if the motive is improve quality .
phillip ellis , uk so , " there are concerns that teachers could feel under continuous scrutiny . "
what 's wrong with that ?

the national audit office said the crb - meant to check staff working with children - had huge delays and could not always do the necessary checks .
it blamed an over-ambitious timetable to set up the crb , and " wrong assumptions " about how it would run .
although things were improving , it said , the crb was still not providing the service it had been set up for .
term delayed the liverpool-based crb could not even access information held by customs or the british transport police , said the report .
so someone suspected by customs of smuggling pornography or drugs , for example , could still get a job working with children .
the agency was also unable to access information on foreign applicants , or to check the criminal history of britons who have lived abroad .
the crb came into operation in march 2002 , and was planned as a " one-stop shop " to give employers details about an individual 's convictions and cautions , as well as intelligence on them gathered by police . "
there was not enough spadework done " edward leigh public accounts committee but the service was beset from the start by problems and delays - hundreds of pupils had the start of their school term in september 2002 put back , for instance , because the crb had failed to provide certificates for teachers .
the report said that when the bureau was set up by the government , much of the planning had been based on " business assumptions " that turned out to be wrong .
the bureau had expected about 85 % of employers would apply for checks on the phone or online for example - but 80 % applied on paper , which takes much longer .
capita fined problems were made worse by disagreements with capita , the company contracted to run operations .
capita has been fined a total of £ 3.69m for failing to meet parts of their service agreement - but had been paid more than £ 23m up to january 2003 , according to the report .
even though fees for a check have been raised from £ 12 to either £ 28 or £ 33 , the service will not break even until 2005-2006 , the report said . "
